NAME

    vendorlib - Use Only Core and Vendor Libraries in @INC

SYNOPSIS

        #!/usr/bin/perl
    
        use vendorlib;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use SomeModule; # will only search in core and vendor paths
        ...

DESCRIPTION

    In a system distribution such as Debian, it may be advisable for Perl
    programs to ignore the user's CPAN-installed modules and only use the
    distribution-provided modules to avoid possible breakage with newer and
    unpackaged versions of modules.

    To that end, this pragma will replace your @INC with only the core and
    vendor @INC paths, ignoring site_perl and $ENV{PERL5LIB} entirely.

    It is recommended that you put use vendorlib; as the first statement in
    your program, before even use strict; and use warnings;.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Thanks to mxey, jawnsy and ribasushi for help with the design.
