NAME
    version::dev - Set $VERSION based on version from git tags

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of version::dev (from Perl
    distribution version-dev), released on 2019-04-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In lib/MyModule.pm you work on (you're using Dist::Zilla and a plugin
    like Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion or
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion):

     package MyModule;
     # VERSION
     ...

    Your git tags:

     % git tag
     v0.003
     v0.002
     v0.001

    When running script that uses your module:

     % perl -Ilib -Mversion::dev -MMyModule E'...'

    $MyModule::VERSION will be set to "0.003_001" (if not already set).

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes you do not explicitly set $VERSION in the module source code
    that you're working on. For example, you're using Dist::Zilla with a
    plugin that will set $VERSION during build, so only your built version
    of modules will have their $VERSION set. Wen working with the unbuilt
    version, this sometimes creates problem or annoyances when other modules
    or other code expect your module to set $VERSION.

    This pragma solves that annoyances. It installs a require hook that will
    check if the module being loaded is: 1) inside the working directory;
    and 2) the module's package does not have $VERSION set.

    If the conditions are met, then first it will: 1) execute "git tag" to
    list tags that look like a version number; 2) grab the most recent
    version; 3) bump the version's dev part, e.g. v1.1 becomes v1.1_001 and
    v1.1_001 becomes v1.1_002; 3) set the module's package $VERSION with
    this version.
