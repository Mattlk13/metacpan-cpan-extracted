Qhull

This is an alpha quality interface to the qhull <https://qhull.org>
library and executables.

At present this module punts to Qhull::PP, which is a wrapper around
qhull executable, not the library.

At present see Qhull::PP for a discussion of the arguments to qhull.

  Future API

qhull has an interesting manner of setting up options, used by both the
executable and the library entry point. It may be impossible to get this
to look Perlish, especially as the qhull manual page is required to
properly use its facilities.

The final interface, which will be the same for the library and the
executable wrapper is still in flux.
