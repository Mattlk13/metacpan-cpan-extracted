NAME

    Encode::Arabic::Franco - Turns Franco-/Chat-Arabic into actual Arabic
    letters

SYNOPSIS

        use Encode::Arabic::Franco;
    
        while ($line = <>) {
            print decode 'franco-arabic', $line;   # 'Franco-Arabic' alias 'Arabizy'
        }
    
        # oneliner
        $ perl -CS -MEncode::Arabic::Franco -pe '$_ = decode "arabizy", $_'

DESCRIPTION

    Franco-Arabic, aka Chat Arabic, Arabizy, is a transliteration of
    Arabic, commonly used on the internet. It restricts itself to the ASCII
    charset and substitutes numbers for the Arabic characters which have no
    equivalent in Latin.

    Franco-Arabic is not standardized. This module is far from complete.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Currently nothing more than a chain of tricks à la:

        $str =~ s/3'/غ/g;
        $str =~ s/7'/خ/g;
