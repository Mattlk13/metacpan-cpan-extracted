NAME
    End::Eval - Take code from import arguments, then eval it in END block

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of End::Eval (from Perl
    distribution End-Eval), released on 2021-08-06.

SYNOPSIS
    On the command-line:

     % perl -MEnd::Eval='use Data::Dump; dd \%INC' `which some-perl-script.pl` ...
     % PERL5OPT='-mData::Dump -MEnd::Eval=Data::Dump::dd\%INC' some-perl-script.pl ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to specify a code in import arguments, basically
    for convenience in one-liners.

    Caveat: specifying in PERL5OPT is tricky because of the limited syntax.
