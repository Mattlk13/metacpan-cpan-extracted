When you've got serialized JSON in a database field, you can use C<jq> to deserialize
it:

    ysql TESTDB 'SELECT json_field FROM table'              # Query the database
        | yto json                                          # Convert to JSON for jq
        | js '.json_field | fromjson'                       # Inflate the JSON
        | yfrom json                                        # Convert back to Yertl
