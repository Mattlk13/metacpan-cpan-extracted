=head1 NAME

Email::ARF - abuse report format (placeholder module)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.011

=head1 PERL VERSION SUPPORT

This module has a long-term perl support period.  That means it will not
require a version of perl released fewer than five years ago.

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
the minimum required perl.
