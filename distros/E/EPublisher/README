    EPublisher - Publish documents in new format

VERSION

    version 1.23

SYNOPSIS

      use EPublisher;
      
      my $yaml     = './test.yml';
      my @projects = qw(Test);
      
      my $deploy   = EPublisher->new;
      $deploy->config( $yaml );
      $deploy->run( \@projects );

    The correspondend YAML file:

      ---
      Test:
        source:
          type: Module
          path: YAML::Tiny
        target:
          type: Text
          path: C:\anything\YAML_Tiny.txt

DESCRIPTION

    This tool aims to simplify publishing of documents, mainly POD. To be
    extendable, it uses a simple plugin system. It uses YAML files for
    configuration (see YAML::Tiny) and many CPAN modules for this task.

    You can write your own plugins for your favourite source format (see
    EPublisher::Source::Base) and/or a plugin for your favourite output
    format.

 Sources

    "Sources" are input sources of the POD. In this base package there are
    three source plugins:

      * Dir

      Get all *.pm and *.pod files in the given directory and its
      subdirectories. See EPublisher::Source::Plugin::Dir.

      * File

      The Pod will be extracted from the given file.

      * Module

      This tool will try to get the POD off the module (without loading the
      module).

    EPublisher::Source::Base describes how you can write your own
    Source-Plugin.

 Targets

    "Targets" are output formats. Currently there are two formats
    supported, but other target plugins will follow.

      * Text

      converts POD to plain text.

    EPublisher::Target::Base describes how you can write your own
    Target-Plugin.

PSEUDO PROTOCOL

    There is a small "pseudo" protocol for the debug messages:

      100 start running source
      101 stop running source (success)
      102 error
      
      200 start running target plugin
      201 stop running target plugin (success)
      202 error
      203 info from target plugin
