NAME
    Exporter::Rinci - A simple wrapper for Exporter for modules with Rinci
    metadata

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.030 of Exporter::Rinci (from Perl
    distribution Exporter-Rinci), released on 2019-08-15.

SYNOPSIS
     package YourModule;

     # most of the time, you only need to do this
     use Exporter::Rinci qw(import);

     our %SPEC;

     # f1 will not be exported by default, but user can import them explicitly using
     # 'use YourModule qw(f1)'
     $SPEC{f1} = { v=>1.1 };
     sub f1 { ... }

     # f2 will be exported by default because it has the export:default tag
     $SPEC{f2} = { v=>1.1, tags=>[qw/a export:default/] };
     sub f2 { ... }

     # f3 will never be exported, and user cannot import them via 'use YourModule
     # qw(f1)' nor via 'use YourModule qw(:a)'
     $SPEC{f3} = { v=>1.1, tags=>[qw/a export:never/] };
     sub f3 { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    Exporter::Rinci is a simple wrapper for Exporter. Before handing out
    control to Exporter's import(), it will look at the exporting module's
    @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK, and %EXPORT_TAGS and if they are empty will fill
    them out with data from Rinci metadata (%SPEC). The rules are similar to
    Perinci::Exporter: all functions will be put in @EXPORT_OK, except
    functions with "export:never" tag will not be exported and functions
    with "export:default" tag will be put in @EXPORT. %EXPORT_TAGS will also
    be filled from functions' tags.

SEE ALSO
    If you want something more full-featured, there's Perinci::Exporter. If
    Exporter::Rinci is like Exporter.pm + Rinci, then Perinci::Exporter is
    like Sub::Exporter + Rinci. It features subroutine renaming, wrapping
    (adding retries, timeouts, etc).
