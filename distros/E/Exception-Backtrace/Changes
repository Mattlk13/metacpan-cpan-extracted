    - Introduce agruments decorator to allow custom stringification
      of perl frame arguments

1.0.11   08.04.2021
    - Don't gather traces twice. Might happen if perl exception is
      invoked twice, i.e. in Perl layers in the flow "Perl->C->Perl"
    - make C++ traces symbolization lazy, as this is heavy operation
      and it is not always needed

1.0.10   24.11.2020
    - separate out C++ sources into dedicated XS::libpanda::backtrace
    - relax tests checks for *bsd with new libpanda

1.0.9    30.07.2020
    - use heap istead of stack to avoid stack corruption on
      large backtraces
    - limit inline functions unwinding to 10 (hardcoded)

1.0.8    01.07.2020
    - sync interfaces with XS::libpanda v1.4.6
    - improve inlined functions and source files handling

1.0.7    29.06.2020
    - relax test checks due to failure on NetBSD

1.0.6    27.06.2020
    - cover test cases for raspberry pi
    - allow fallback on default resolver
    - fix tests for the case, when perl or xs-modules are compiled
      without debug info

1.0.5    22.06.2020
    - more correctly handle on systems with buggy glibc/libunwind

1.0.4    22.06.2020
    - version bump

1.0.3    19.06.2020
    - do attach backtrace within DESTROY, as it reports confusion to
      Exception::Backtrace instead of original code
    - let it works on Windows too
    - fix tests on Darwin/MacOSX
    - simplify internals with XS::libpanda v1.3.15
    - min perl is 5.20 now

1.0.2    02.04.2020
    - fix tests on FreeBSD with new XS::libpanda
    - slightly improve performance on traces symbolization
    - respect effective stash name (can be set via Sub::Name)

1.0.1    24.03.2020
    - bugfix: the library in perl call is called sub package, not callee
    - disable some tests on NetBSD
    - disable some tests on FreeBSD (i386 arch)
    - fix/generalize tests on Linux
    - min perl version 5.22.0 (required for CvHASGV)

1.0.0    16.03.2020
    - first release
