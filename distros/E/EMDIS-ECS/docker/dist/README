This Docker container includes test configurations to facilitate testing
of EMDIS::ECS email communications.

Email communications testing is dependent on SMTP, POP3, and IMAP services,
typically provided by a companion GreenMail container.

The ecs-AA, ecs-BB, and ecs-CC subdirectories contain test configurations
for nodes AA, BB, and CC.  The .gnupg subdirectory contains the GnuPG
public and secret keyrings used by those test nodes.
