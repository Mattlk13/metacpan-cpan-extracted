This Docker container includes test configurations to facilitate testing
of EMDIS::ECS email communications.

Email communications testing is dependent on SMTP, POP3, and IMAP services,
typically provided by a companion greenmail container.

AMQP 1.0 communications testing is dependent on an AMQP broker, typically
provided by a companion qpid-broker-cpp container.

The ecs-AA, ecs-BB, ecs-CC, ecs-DD, and ecs-EE subdirectories contain test
configurations for nodes AA, BB, CC, DD, and EE.  The .gnupg subdirectory
contains the GnuPG public and secret keyrings used by those test nodes.
