EMDIS Communication System (ECS)
================================

This is a Perl implementation of ECS, the EMDIS Communication System.
Details regarding ECS and EMDIS are available from the ZKRD web site
(http://www.zkrd.de/).


INSTALLATION

To install this package type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
(sudo)   make install
   (make clean)

After the ECS package is installed, run the ecs_setup program to help
create the ECS configuration file:

   mkdir ecs
   ecs_setup ecs/ecs.cfg

The ECS configuration file can also be edited manually, using a text
editor.

Here's an example showing how to set up and install Perl ECS.

$ mkdir ecshome
$ cd ecshome
(ecshome)$ tar xzf ~/EMDIS-ECS-0.36.tar.gz
(ecshome)$ cd EMDIS-ECS-0.36
(ECS-0.35)$ perl Makefile.PL
(ECS-0.35)$ make
(ECS-0.35)$ make test
(ECS-0.35)$ sudo make install
(ECS-0.35)$ cd ..
(ecshome)$ ecs_setup

Alternatively, because "make install" typically requires root
privileges, it may be more convenient to install Perl ECS and related
modules into a local directory, e.g. using cpanminus.

$ mkdir locallib
$ cpanm --local-lib locallib Net::SMTP~3.05
$ cpanm --local-lib locallib Mail::IMAPClient~3.18
$ cpanm --local-lib locallib Net::POP3~3.06
$ cpanm --local-lib locallib IO::Socket::SSL~2.007
$ cpanm --local-lib locallib EMDIS-ECS-0.36.tar.gz

The ecs_setup script asks a series of questions and creates an ecs.cfg
file based on the answers given.  If needed, it can also create the
required ECS_DAT_DIR subdirectories.  The directory structure and script
names are similar to those described in the EMDIS ECS specification.
Of course, Perl ECS can also run under Windows, using Strawberry Perl
or ActivePerl.

Note:  For Strawberry Perl (on MS Windows), the sequence of commands
to extract, build, and install the Perl ECS code is slightly different
from that shown above.  Here's a brief example which uses the ptar and
dmake commands provided by Strawberry Perl:

  ptar xzf EMDIS-ECS-0.36.tar.gz
  cd EMDIS-ECS-0.36
  perl Makefile.PL
  dmake
  dmake test
  dmake install


DEPENDENCIES

ECS requires the following modules and libraries.  Most of these are
included with Perl 5.8:

  CPAN::Version
  Data::Dumper
  Fcntl
  File::Basename
  File::Copy
  File::Spec
  File::Temp
  Getopt::Long
  IO::File
  IO::Handle
  IPC::Open2
  Mail::IMAPClient (optional)
  Net::POP3
  Net::SMTP
  SDBM_File
  Text::ParseWords

In addition to the above, ECS requires the use of an encryption
program such as PGP (http://www.pgp.com/, http://www.pgpi.org/) or
GnuPG (http://www.gnupg.org/) to send and receive encrypted data.

Effort was made to avoid dependency on modules not part of the
standard Perl distribution.  This software was originally developed
and tested using Perl 5.6.1 (ActivePerl build 632) on Solaris.
