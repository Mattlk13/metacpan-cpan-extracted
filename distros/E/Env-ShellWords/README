NAME

    Env::ShellWords - Environment variables for arguments as array

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     # Tie Interface
     use Env::ShellWords;
     tie my @CFLAGS,   'CFLAGS';
     tie my @LDFLAGS,  'LDFLAGS';
    
     # same thing with import interface:
     use Env::ShellWords qw( @CFLAGS @LDFLAGS );
     
     # usage:
     $ENV{CFLAGS} = '-DBAR=1';
     unshift @CFLAGS, '-I/foo/include';
     push @CFLAGS, '-DFOO=Define With Spaces';
     
     # now:
     # $ENV{CFLAGS} = '-I/foo/include -DBAR=1 -DFOO=Define\\ With\\ Spaces';
     
     unshift @LDFLAGS, '-L/foo/lib';
     push @LDFLAGS, '-lfoo';

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an array like interface to environment variables
    that contain flags. For example Autoconf can uses the environment
    variables like CFLAGS or LDFLAGS, and this allows you to manipulate
    those variables without doing space quoting and other messy mucky
    stuff.

    The intent is to use this from alienfile to deal with hierarchical
    prerequisites.

CAVEATS

    Not especially fast. undef gets mapped to the empty string '' since
    undef doesn't have a meaning as an argument in a string.
