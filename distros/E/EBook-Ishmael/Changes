Revision history for Perl module EBook::Ishmael.

0.07  Feb 25 2025
  - Added -r/--raw option: Dumps the raw, unformatted text contents of a given
    ebook.
  - Added -c/--cover option: Dump the cover image of a given ebook if one is
    present.
    - As a result, pdftopng is an additional dependency if one wishes to dump
      PDF covers. pdftopng should be included with most versions of
      poppler-utils.
    - MIME::Base64 was also added as a dependency, although it should be
      included with Perl core.
  - XHTML is now considered a seperate format from HTML (although its class is
    derived from the HTML class, so it should act mostly the same except for
    being called XHTML rather than HTML).
  - Recognize some more FictionBook2 metadata.
  - Improve some format heuristics.
    - FictionBook2, HTML, XHTML
  - When reading EPUBs, try not to dump items that are not under the
    "application/xhtml+xml" media type.
  - Moved PDB modules out of EBook namespace.
  - Removed EBook::Ishmael::EBook::Skeleton.

0.06  Feb 22 2025
  - When ran with no arguments, queequeg reads input from stdin.
  - queequeg now accepts multiple files as argument.
  - --output option now works with --metadata and --meta-json options.
  - Removed extra newline from json output.
  - No longer bothering categorizing Changes entries.
  - AZW support.
  - Add support for Huff/CDIC MOBI compression scheme.

0.05  Feb 17 2025
  Added:
    - queequeg: ishmael's own HTML dumper script that acts as a fallback
      formatter if none are available.
  Changes:
    - Specify XML::LibXML version 1.70 as minimum required version.
  Improvements:
    - If temporary directory and working directory are not ok directories to
      unzip epub to, try HOME directory.
    - When reading HTML documents, ishmael attempts to recover malformed HTML.
  Fixes:
    - Check if working directory is writable instead of readable when creating
      temporary epub extract directory.

0.04  Feb 14 2025
  Added:
    - Support for TEST_PDF environment variable in tests. This allows you to
      force enable/disable tests for PDFs regardless of whether poppler utils
      are installed or not.
  Changes:
    - Introduced Cwd dependency.
    - Specified File::Temp version 0.10 as minimum required version.
  Improvements:
    - More accurate text heuristic.
  Fixes:
    - Try to unzip epub to working directory if temporary directory is
      symlinked, as Archive::Zip does not support unzipping to symlinked
      directories. This was primarily an issue with Darwin platforms.
    - Corrected some documentation errors.

0.03  Feb 11 2025
  Changes:
    - ishmael now uses a format-agnostic interface for handling ebook metadata.
      This means that although the metadata ishmael gathers will now be less
      detailed, it should at least be consistent across different formats.
  Fixes:
    - Modify PDF tests to account for differing output between different
      verions of pdfinfo.
    - Use '-T text/html' option for w3m, so that it recognizes given data as
      HTML and actually tries to format it.

0.02  Feb 10 2025
  Added:
    - --format can now recognize some alternative format names.
      - fb2 for FictionBook2
      - xhtml for HTML
  Changes:
    - Removed dumper list from help message.
  Fixes:
    - Fix the syntax of the width check in browser_dump() to make it compatible
      with older Perl versions.
    - Add missing developer documentation.

0.01  Feb 09 2025
  - Initial release.
