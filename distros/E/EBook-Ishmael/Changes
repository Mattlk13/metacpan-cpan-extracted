Revision history for Perl module EBook::Ishmael.

0.03  Feb 11 2025
  Changes:
    - ishmael now uses a format-agnostic interface for handling ebook metadata.
      This means that although the metadata ishmael gathers will now be less
      detailed, it should at least be consistent across different formats.
  Fixes:
    - Modify PDF tests to account for differing output between different
      verions of pdfinfo.
    - Use '-T text/html' option for w3m, so that it recognizes given data as
      HTML and actually tries to format it.

0.02  Feb 10 2025
  Added:
    - --format can now recognize some alternative format names.
      - fb2 for FictionBook2
      - xhtml for HTML
  Changes:
    - Removed dumper list from help message.
  Fixes:
    - Fix the syntax of the width check in browser_dump() to make it compatible
      with older Perl versions.
    - Add missing developer documentation.
