EZDBI provides an easy, simple interface to SQL databases from Perl.
You are not required to manage the DBI objects yourself,  everything
is done behind the scenes.  Complex queries are possible. All you do
is call the functions.  If you're retrieving data,  it comes back as
a simple array (of arrays);  although additional control is possible.
See the enclosed sample.pl an example program written with EZDBI.
