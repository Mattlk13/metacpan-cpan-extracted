NAME
    Org::To::Text - Export Org document to text

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.050 of Org::To::Text (from Perl
    distribution Org-To-Text), released on 2022-10-11.

SYNOPSIS
     use Org::To::Text qw(org_to_text);

     # non-OO interface
     my $res = org_to_text(
         source_file   => 'todo.org', # or source_str
         #target_file  => 'todo.txt', # default is to return the text in $res->[2]
         #include_tags => [...], # default exports all tags.
         #exclude_tags => [...], # behavior mimics emacs's include/exclude rule
     );
     die "Failed" unless $res->[0] == 200;

     # OO interface
     my $oea = Org::To::Text->new();
     my $text = $oea->export($doc); # $doc is Org::Document object

DESCRIPTION
    Export Org format to plain text, which means mostly things will be
    formatted as-is. To customize, you can subclass this module.

    A command-line utility org-to-ansi-text is available in the distribution
    App::OrgUtils.

new(%args)
  $exp->export_document($doc) => text
    Export document to text.

FUNCTIONS
  org_to_text
    Usage:

     org_to_text() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Export Org document to text.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
