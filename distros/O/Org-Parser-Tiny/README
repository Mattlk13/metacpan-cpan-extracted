NAME
    Org::Parser::Tiny - Parse Org documents with as little code (and no
    non-core deps) as possible

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Org::Parser::Tiny (from Perl
    distribution Org-Parser-Tiny), released on 2020-12-30.

SYNOPSIS
     use Org::Parser::Tiny;
     my $orgp = Org::Parser::Tiny->new();

     # parse a file
     my $doc = $orgp->parse_file("$ENV{HOME}/todo.org");

     # parse a string
     $doc = $orgp->parse(<<EOF);
     * this is a headline
     * this is another headline
     ** this is yet another headline
     EOF

    Dump document structure using Tree::Dump:

     use Tree::Dump;
     td($doc);

    Select document nodes using Data::CSel:

     use Data::CSel qw(csel);

     # select headlines with "foo" in their title
     my @nodes = csel(
         {class_prefixes => ["Org::Parser::Tiny::Node"]},
         "Headline[title =~ /foo/]"
     );

    Manipulate tree nodes with path-like semantic using Tree::FSLike:

     use Tree::FSLike;
     my $fs = Tree::FSLike->new(
         tree => $doc,
         gen_filename_method => sub { $_[0]->can("title") ? $_[0]->title : "$_[0]" },
     );

     # list nodes right above the root node
     my @nodes = $fs->ls;

     # use wildcard to list nodes
     my @nodes = $fs->ls("*foo*");

     # remove top-level headlines which have "foo" in their title
     $fs->rm($doc, "/*foo*");

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a more lightweight alternative to <Org:Parser>. Currently
    it is very simple and only parses headlines; thus it is several times
    faster than Org::Parser. I use this to write utilities like
    sort-org-headlines-tiny or to use it with Tree::FSLike.

NODE CLASSES
  Org::Parser::Tiny::Node
    Base class.

    Methods:

    *   parent

    *   children

    *   as_string

  Org::Parser::Tiny::Node::Document
    Root node.

    Methods:

  Org::Parser::Tiny::Node::Headline
    Root node.

    Methods:

    *   level

        Integer.

    *   title

        Str.

    *   is_todo

        Whether headline has a done or undone todo state. For example, the
        following headlines will have their is_todo() return true:

         * TODO foo
         * DONE bar

    *   is_done

        Whether headline has a done todo state. For example, the following
        headlines will have their is_done() return true:

         * DONE bar

    *   todo_state

        Todo state or empty string. For example, this headline:

         * TODO foo

        will have "TODO" as the todo_state, while:

         * foo

        will have "".

    *   tags

        Array of strings. For example, this headline:

         * foo    :tag1:tag2:

        will have its "tags()" return "["tag1","tag2"]", while this
        headline:

         * foo

        will have its "tags()" return "[]".

ATTRIBUTES
METHODS
  new
    Usage:

     my $orgp = Org::Parser::Tiny->new;

    Constructor. Create a new parser instance.

  parse
    Usage:

     my $doc = $orgp->parse($str | $arrayref | $coderef | $filehandle, \%opts);

    Parse document (which can be contained in a $str, an array of lines
    $arrayref, a $coderef which will be called for chunks until it returns
    undef, or a $filehandle.

    Returns a tree of node objects (of class "Org::Parser::Tiny::Node" and
    its subclasses "Org::Parser::Tiny::Node::Document" and
    "Org::Parser::Tiny::Node::Headline"). The tree node complies to
    Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node role, so these tools are available:
    Data::CSel, Tree::Dump, Tree::FSLike, etc.

    Will die if there are syntax errors in documents.

    Known options:

  parse_file
    Usage:

     my $doc = $orgp->parse_file($filename, \%opts);

    Just like "parse", but will load document from file instead.

    Known options (aside from those known by parse()):
