NAME

    OPM::Maker::Command::depcheck - Check if ticketsystem addon
    dependencies are installed (works for ((OTRS)) Community Edition, Znuny
    and OTOBO)

VERSION

    version 1.0.1

DESCRIPTION

    Ticketsystem addons can define dependencies in the .opm files, e.g.

        <PackageRequired Version="6.0.0">FAQ</PackageRequired>
        <ModuleRequired Version="8.0">Geo::IP2Location</ModuleRequired>
        <ModuleRequired Version="0.02">HTTP::AcceptLanguage</ModuleRequired>

    In this case, the addon requires an other addon - FAQ with minimum
    version 6.0.0 - and two CPAN modules.

    This OPM::Maker command checks for a given .sopm or .opm file if the
    dependencies are already installed.

HOW IT WORKS

    For the other addons, this command tries to find the ticketsystem
    installation (it searches for /opt/otrs, /opt/otobo or /opt/znuny) and
    searches the database for installed addons.

    If it doesn't find the addons in the database, it looks for a
    /opt/{otrs,otobo,znuny}/$addonname.sopm file. If that file exists the
    addon is marked as installed.

    For the CPAN dependencies, this command tries to use the module.
