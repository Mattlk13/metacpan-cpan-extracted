0.04    2023-08-23
        [CHANGES]
         * No longer applies constraint at every modification; only during
           constructor or `:writer` accessors. Improves performance of
           internal code, and doesn't over-promise what it can't deliver.

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Ensure the checker-generating expression is eval()'ed in the right
           package name, and with the right hints and features enabled

        [CHANGES]

           remembering to add some SYNOPSIS code
         * Cache the `->check` method CV for improved runtime performance
