- 3.00 Fri Jul 10 11:01:03  CDT 2015

 - Perl version to "use v5.20" for supported Perl.
 - Support regex or subref to validate return value. 
 - Allow flags between tests or within them to set local
   values.
 - Allow stacked exection of tests with prior "nofinish" to 
   avoid calling done_testing after each block of tests.
 - "finish" in last test block (or as separate block) calls
   done_testing.
 - Input test as YAML.
 - use regex for expect with "regex" flag + text of regex as expect
   value (workaround for YAML segfaults on regex).
 - use coderef for expect value to pass test, error, return into a
   that can return true/false for OK.

- 2.00 Sat Nov 17 17:08:57 CST 2012

 - replace the "-x" interface with simpler X/noX or 
   x=Y.

 - Single handler for back end in Execute, drops need
   for separate Benchmark & Common modules.

 - Use Time::HiRes instead of Benchmark.

 - Up the version number to 2.00 to reflect the API changes.

    POD updates

- 1.13 Mon Mar 31 19:27:27 EDT 2008

 -  Minor Makefile.PL, testfile udpates.

- 1.11 

 -  Minor change in use arg's: -e [optinal name], 
    -b [optinal name] allow exporting both exercise
    and benchmark with alternate names; drops -n
    switch (which only handles one of them).

- 1.10 Wed Jun 27 02:31:07 EDT 2007

 -  Split into separate modules for benchmark, execute 
    operation. Avoids loading benchmark module if it 
    won't be used; pushed common variables and utility
    subs into separate module.

- 1.04 Fri Jun  1 16:42:07 EDT 2007

 -  eval use Time::HiRes then Benchmark qw( :hireswallclock ).
    If that fails then use Benchmark without the hireswallclock.

- 1.05 Sun Jun  3 15:00:57 EDT 2007

 -  Require Benchmark-1.07, which handles issues with 
    missing Time::HiRes properly.

 -  Remove begin hacks for dealing with missing Time::HiRes.
