NAME

    Object::Pad::SlotAttr::Trigger - invoke an instance method after a
    :writer accessor

SYNOPSIS

       use Object::Pad;
       use Object::Pad::SlotAttr::Trigger;
    
       class Label {
          has $title :param :reader :writer :Trigger(redraw);
    
          method redraw {
             ...
          }
       }
    
       my $label = Label->new( text => "Something" );
    
       $label->set_label( "New text here" );
       # $label->redraw is automatically invoked

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a third-party slot attribute for Object::Pad-based
    classes, which declares that a named instance method shall be invoked
    after a generated :writer accessor method is called.

    WARNING The ability for Object::Pad to take third-party slot attributes
    is still new and highly experimental, and subject to much API change in
    future. As a result, this module should be considered equally
    experimental. As a further point, it is currently pinned to requiring
    an exact $Object::Pad::VERSION of 0.47, to defend against possible API
    or ABI breakage. It is expected that as the API eventually stablises,
    this restriction can be removed.

SLOT ATTRIBUTES

 :Trigger

       has $slot :writer :Trigger(NAME) ...;

    Declares that the accessor method generated for the slot by the :writer
    attribute will invoke the method named by the :Trigger attribute, after
    the new value has been stored into the slot itself. This method is
    invoked with no additional arguments, in void context.

    Note that this only applies to the generated accessor method. It does
    not apply to direct modifications of the slot variable by method code
    within the class itself.
