NAME

    OTRS::OPM::Maker - Module/App to build and test OTRS packages

VERSION

    version 0.12

DESCRIPTION

    If you do OTRS package development, you need to be able to check your
    package: Are all files of the package included in the file list in the
    sopm file? Is the sopm file valid? And you need to create the OPM file.
    There is otrs.PackageManager.pl included in OTRS installations, but
    sometimes you might not have an OTRS installation on the machine where
    you want to build the package (e.g. when you build the package in a
    Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org> job).

    OTRS::OPM::Maker provides opmbuild that is a small tool for several
    tasks. At the moment it supports:

      * filetest

      Check if all files in the filelist exist on your disk and if all
      files on the disk are listed in the filelist

      * somptest

      Checks if your .sopm file is valid

      * dependencies

      List all CPAN- and OTRS- dependencies of your package

      * build

      Create the OPM file

      * index

      build an index file for an OPM repository.

    Currently under development:

      * dbtest

      Check if the DatabaseInstall and DatabaseUninstall sections in your
      .sopm files are valid. And it checks for SQL keywords.
