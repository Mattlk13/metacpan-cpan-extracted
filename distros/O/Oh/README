oh version 0.01
===============

INTRODUCTION

oh is an experimental project aimed at implementing a Lisp interpreter in Perl. While itâ€™s currently a prototype, it demonstrates the core concepts of Lisp evaluation, including basic syntax, macros, lambda functions, and object-oriented integration with Perl.

At this stage, the project is more of a proof of concept than a fully polished tool. It is intended for experimenting with Lisp in Perl and exploring the language's potential.
