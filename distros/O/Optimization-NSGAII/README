Optimization-NSGAII version 0.01
================================

DESCRIPTION

	NSGAII - non dominant sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization

	NSGAII.pm apply (with some variations) the NSGA-II algorithm described in the paper: 

		A Fast and Elitist Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm:NSGA-II
			Kalyanmoy Deb, Associate Member, IEEE, Amrit Pratap, Sameer Agarwal, and T. Meyarivan

	NSGAII.pm performs a mathematical multi-objective optimization using a genetic algorithm approach: 
	It searches the input parameters (genes) which minimize a set of output functions (individuals of a population) and with some luck a Pareto front is produced. 
	In the Pareto front no solution is better than the others because each solution is a trade-off.

INSTALLATION

	To install this module type the following:
	
       cpan Optimization::NSGAII
		
	or, after decompressing the archive tar.gz, type the following:	

	   perl Makefile.PL
	   make
	   make test
	   make install
