NAME
    Org::To::ANSIText - Export Org document to text with ANSI color codes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Org::To::ANSIText (from Perl
    distribution Org-To-ANSIText), released on 2022-10-11.

SYNOPSIS
     use Org::To::ANSIText qw(org_to_ansi_text);

     # non-OO interface
     my $res = org_to_ansi_text(
         source_file   => 'todo.org', # or source_str
         #target_file  => 'todo.txt', # default is to return the text in $res->[2]
         #include_tags => [...], # default exports all tags.
         #exclude_tags => [...], # behavior mimics emacs's include/exclude rule
     );
     die "Failed" unless $res->[0] == 200;

     # OO interface
     my $oea = Org::To::ANSIText->new();
     my $text = $oea->export($doc); # $doc is Org::Document object

DESCRIPTION
    Export Org format to ANSI text (text with ANSI escape codes). To
    customize, you can subclass this module.

    A command-line utility org-to-ansi-text is available in the distribution
    App::OrgUtils.

new(%args)
  $exp->export_document($doc) => text
    Export document to text.

FUNCTIONS
  org_to_ansi_text
    Usage:

     org_to_ansi_text(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Export Org document to text with ANSI color codes.

    This is the non-OO interface. For more customization, consider
    subclassing Org::To::ANSIText.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_tags => *array[str]*

        Exclude trees that carry one of these tags.

        If the whole document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole
        document will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of
        these tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the
        heading hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not
        the text below those headings.

        exclude_tags is evaluated after include_tags.

    *   ignore_unknown_settings => *bool*

    *   include_tags => *array[str]*

        Include trees that carry one of these tags.

        Works like Org's 'org-export-select-tags' variable. If the whole
        document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole document
        will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of these
        tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading
        hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not the
        text below those headings.

    *   source_file => *str*

        Source Org file to export.

    *   source_str => *str*

        Alternatively you can specify Org string directly.

    *   target_file => *str*

        Text file to write to.

        If not specified, text string will be returned.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
