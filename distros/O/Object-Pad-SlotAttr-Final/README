NAME

    Object::Pad::SlotAttr::Final - declare Object::Pad slots readonly after
    construction

SYNOPSIS

       use Object::Pad;
       use Object::Pad::SlotAttr::Final;
    
       class Rectangle {
          has $width  :param :reader :Final;
          has $height :param :reader :Final;
    
          has $area :reader :Final;
    
          ADJUST {
             $area = $width * $height;
          }
       }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a third-party slot attribute for Object::Pad-based
    classes, which declares that the slot it is attached to shall be set as
    readonly when the constructor returns, disallowing further modification
    to it.

    WARNING The ability for Object::Pad to take third-party slot attributes
    is still new and highly experimental, and subject to much API change in
    future. As a result, this module should be considered equally
    experimental.

SLOT ATTRIBUTES

 :Final

       has $slot :Final ...;
       has $slot :Final ... = DEFAULT;

    Declares that the slot variable will be set readonly at the end of the
    constructor, after any assignments from :param declarations or ADJUST
    blocks. At this point, the value cannot otherwise be modified by
    directly writing into the slot variable.

       has $slot :Final;
    
       ADJUST { $slot = 123; }    # this is permitted
    
       method m { $slot = 456; }  # this will fail

    Note that this is only a shallow readonly setting; if the slot variable
    contains a reference to a data structure, that structure itself remains
    mutable.

       has $aref :Final;
       ADJUST { $aref = []; }
    
       method more { push @$aref, "another"; }   # this is permitted
