 BUILDARGS

ATTRIBUTES

      * sources

METHODS

 new

    new has only one mandatory parameter: sources. This has to be an array
    reference of URLs for repositories' framework.xml files.

      my $repo = OPM::Repository->new(
          sources => [qw!
              http://opar.perl-services.de/framework.xml
              http://ftp.framework.org/pub/framework/packages/framework.xml
              http://ftp.framework.org/pub/framework/itsm/packages33/framework.xml
          !],
      );

 find

    Search for an add on for a given OPM version in those repositories. It
    returns a list of urls if the add on was found, undef otherwise.

      my @urls = $repo->find(
        name      => 'ITSMCore',
        framework => '3.3',
      );

    Find a specific version

      my @urls = $repo->find(
        name      => 'ITSMCore',
        framework => '3.3',
        version   => '1.4.8',
      );

 list

    List all addons found in the repositories

      my @addons = $repo->list;
      say $_ for @addons;

    You can also define the OPM version

      my @addons = $repo->list( framework => '5.0.x' );
      say $_ for @addons;

    Both snippets print a simple list of addon names. If you want to to
    create a list with more information, you can use

      my @addons = $repo->list(
          framework => '5.0.x',
          details   => 1,
      );
      say sprintf "%s (%s) on %s\n", $_->{name}, $_->{version}, $_->{url} for @addons;
