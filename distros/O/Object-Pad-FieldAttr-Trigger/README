NAME

    Object::Pad::FieldAttr::Trigger - invoke an instance method after a
    :writer accessor

SYNOPSIS

       use Object::Pad;
       use Object::Pad::FieldAttr::Trigger;
    
       class Label {
          has $title :param :reader :writer :Trigger(redraw);
    
          method redraw {
             ...
          }
       }
    
       my $label = Label->new( text => "Something" );
    
       $label->set_label( "New text here" );
       # $label->redraw is automatically invoked

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a third-party field attribute for
    Object::Pad-based classes, which declares that a named instance method
    shall be invoked after a generated :writer accessor method is called.

    WARNING The ability for Object::Pad to take third-party field
    attributes is still new and highly experimental, and subject to much
    API change in future. As a result, this module should be considered
    equally experimental.

FIELD ATTRIBUTES

 :Trigger

       has $field :writer :Trigger(NAME) ...;

    Declares that the accessor method generated for the field by the
    :writer attribute will invoke the method named by the :Trigger
    attribute, after the new value has been stored into the field itself.
    This method is invoked with no additional arguments, in void context.

    Note that this only applies to the generated accessor method. It does
    not apply to direct modifications of the field variable by method code
    within the class itself.
