        Switching hosting to helix as bitbucket is shut down.

0.0201  2015-01-21

        Fixed error happening on older perls (wrong isa usage).

0.02    2015-01-21

        Dropped dependency Math::Random::MT (this module causes
        "double free or corruption" issues on newer glibc, at least in
        some cases). Instead, new nonce generation routine, which
        guarantees unique nonces in realistic cases.

        Added dependency on Thread::Queue 3.02 (which introduced
        deque_timed).

        Various documentation fixes.

        Various internal refactorings.
        
        Various technical fixes (enabled some, removed some
        automatical tests, improved metadata, fixed newlines and
        formatting etc).

0.01    2015-01-20
