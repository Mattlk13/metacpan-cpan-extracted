Object::Properties

This is a class builder with a minimal API that can be used as a drop-in
upgrade for Object::Tiny. It adds support support for field validation
and read-write fields, realised as lvalue methods. Validation for lvalue
writes will be efficient in XS-capable environments but will still
function, slowly, in other situations.
