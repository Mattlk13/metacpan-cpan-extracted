        [CHANGES]
         * Accept optional version number for `class` declaration and
           `extends` base class
         * Provide a default `BUILDALL` method which invokes all the available
           `BUILD` methods of component packages
         * Unit-test that Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically works correctly with
           object slots and document the fact that `local` does not

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Generate the constructor as an XSUB so we can find the superclass
           for derived subclasses better and avoid an infinite recusion loop
           on double-subclassing.

0.08    2019-11-10
        [CHANGES]
         * Accept `class Name;` to introduce a toplevel class scope

0.06    2019-10-23

0.04    2019-10-19
        [CHANGES]
         * Croak on attempts to invoke methods on non-instances, non-derived
           classes, etc...
         * Support perls back to 5.16 by various trickery
         * Store array and hash slot variables via RV so the instances are
           well-behaved as perl data structures
