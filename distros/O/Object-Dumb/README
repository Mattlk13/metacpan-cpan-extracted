SYNOPSIS

     use Object::Dumb;
    
     my $obj = Object::Dumb->new;
     $obj->foo;          # -> 0
     $obj->bar(1, 2, 3); # -> 0

    You can limit what methods will be available:

     my $obj = Object::Dumb->new(methods => [qw/foo bar/]);
     $obj->foo; # ok
     $obj->bar; # ok
     $obj->baz; # dies

    or:

     my $obj = Object::Dumb->new(methods => qr/^(foo.*|bar.+)$/);
     $obj->foo;  # ok
     $obj->barb; # ok
     $obj->baz;  # dies

    And you can also customize what value the methods will return:

     my $obj = Object::Dumb->new(returns => 1);
     print $obj->foo; # 1

DESCRIPTION

    This module lets you create a "dumb" object that responds to any method
    and just returns 0.

    You can customize by limiting what methods the object will respond to,
    and what value the methods will return.
