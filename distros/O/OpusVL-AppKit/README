NAME

    OpusVL::AppKit

VERSION

    version 2.29

DESCRIPTION

    AppKit is based on CatalystX::AppBuilder, and includes some modules for
    common tasks. The idea is that you produce a thin AppKit application,
    and stick multiple modules together.

    We recommend Dist::Zilla to get you started on AppKit. That's because
    we've made minting profiles so we don't have to explain how it works.

        $ dzil new -PAppKit MyApp
        $ dzil new -PAppKitX MyApp::AppKitX::NewModularFeature

    See Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::AppKit and
    Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::AppKitX.

    Whenever you mint a new AppKit application, you'll end up with a common
    set of files:

    MyApp.pm:

        package MyApp;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use MyApp::Builder;
    
        our $VERSION='0.001';
        
        my $builder = MyApp::Builder->new(
            appname => __PACKAGE__,
            version => $VERSION
        );
        
        $builder->bootstrap;
    
        1;

    MyApp/Builder.pm:

    (see also "Builder")

        package MyApp::Builder;
        use Moose;
        extends 'OpusVL::AppKit::Builder';
        override _build_superclasses => sub 
        {
            return [ 'OpusVL::AppKit' ]
        };
    
        override _build_config => sub
        {
            my $self   = shift;
            my $config = super();
    
            $config->{'Controller::Login'} =
            {
                traits => '+OpusVL::AppKit::TraitFor::Controller::Login::NewSessionIdOnLogin',
            };
    
            $config->{'View::CMS::Page'}->{AUTO_FILTER} = 'html';
    
            return $config;
        };

    myapp.conf:

        name MyApp
    
        <Model::CMS>
            connect_info dbi:SQLite:t/db/test.db
            connect_info username
            connect_info password
        </Model::CMS>
    
        <Model::AppKitAuthDB>
            connect_info dbi:SQLite:t/db/test.db
            connect_info username
            connect_info password
        </Model::AppKitAuthDB>

NAME

    OpusVL::AppKit - Catalyst based application

AppKitX

    AppKitX is the namespace we use for the individual modules from which
    your application is built. Each of this is almost an entire Catalyst
    application per se; except that it doesn't inherit from Catalyst
    itself, and requires marshalling by means of a Builder class.

    We generally recommend keeping things as separate as possible, so we
    normally have:

    An AppKitX distribution for each logical chunk of the site

    A DB distribution, usually a DBIx::Class distribution that stands
    independently of the application itself

    An AppKitX::DB distribution, which provides the Catalyst::Model for the
    aforementioned DB distribution.

    For example, once we've created MyApp, we would create
    MyApp::AppKitX::SomeModule, MyApp::DB, and MyApp::AppKitX::DB.

    There will be many MyApp::AppKitX::SomeModule style distributions; and
    possibly some MyCompany::AppKitX::SomeModule distributions, for common
    modules.

Builder

    The builder is provided as a skeleton, but this is where you decide
    which modules get loaded. To do so, you override a method in
    MyApp/Builder.pm.

        override _build_plugins => sub {
            my $plugins = super();
            return [ @$plugins, qw/
                MyApp::AppKitX::Plugin1
                MyApp::AppKitX::Plugin2
            / ];
        }

    This is all that's required to connect those plugins together - an app
    with a builder with this method, listing them.
