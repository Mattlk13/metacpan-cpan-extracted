NAME
    Object::Util::Stringify - Utility routines related to object
    stringification

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Object::Util::Stringify (from
    Perl distribution Object-Util-Stringify), released on 2021-11-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Object::Util::Stringify qw(
         set_stringify
         unset_stringify
     );

     # An easy way to set what string an object should stringify to
     set_stringify($obj, "oh my!");
     print $obj; # => prints "oh my!"

     # Remove stringification
     unset_stringify($obj);
     print $obj; # => prints the standard stringification, e.g. My::Package=HASH(0x562847e245e8)

DESCRIPTION
    Keywords: overload, stringify, stringification

FUNCTIONS
  set_stringify
    Usage:

     set_stringify($obj, $str);

    Set object stringification to $str.

    Caveats: cloned object currently will not inherit the stringification,
    serialization currently does not serialize the stringification
    information.

  unset_stringify
    Usage:

     unset_stringify($obj);

    Reset/remove object stringification.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
