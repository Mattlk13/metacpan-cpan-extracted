    OPM::Validate - Validate .opm files

VERSION

    version 1.12

SYNOPSIS

        use v5.20;
        use OPM::Validate;
    
        my $content = 'content of .opm file';
        my $success = eval {
            OPM::Validate->validate( $content );
        };
    
        say "It's valid" if $success;

DESCRIPTION

    .opm files are used as addons for the Znuny <https://znuny.org>, OTOBO
    <https://otobo.de> and ((OTRS)) Community Edition ticketing systems.
    They are XML files with specific XML tags.

    This module checks if all needed XML tags are there.

    Currently the error messages might be misleading, this is something we
    are working on.

METHODS

 validate

    This checks the given string if it matches the needs. It dies if an
    error occurs and returns 1 otherwise.

        use v5.10;

        my $content = 'content of .opm file';
        my $success = eval {
            OPM::Validate->validate( $content );
        };
    
        say "It's valid" if $success;
