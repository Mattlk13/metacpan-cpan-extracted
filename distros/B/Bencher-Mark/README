VERSION

    distribution Bencher-Mark), released on 2018-10-05.

SYNOPSIS
     use Bencher::Mark qw(:all);

     # You can specify undef for $count

     timethis($count, $code);

     timethese($count, {
         Name1 => '... code ...', # specify code as string

     });

DESCRIPTION
    EXPERIMENTAL.

    This is an experiment to make writing benchmarks using Bencher easier.
    This module offers an interface like Benchmark.pm, but internally it
    constructs a scenario, feeds it to Bencher::Backend, then displays the
    formatted result.

FUNCTIONS
  timethis
