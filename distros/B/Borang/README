DESCRIPTION

    EARLY RELEASE, WORK IN PROGRESS, MANY THINGS ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

    Borang is a function-oriented form framework. Borang can generate forms
    using information from Rinci function metadata. After you fill out and
    submit a form, the form submission will be converted into function
    arguments and sent to the function via function call.

    Borang is environment-agnostic: it can target HTML forms as well as
    CLI/CUI/GUI.
