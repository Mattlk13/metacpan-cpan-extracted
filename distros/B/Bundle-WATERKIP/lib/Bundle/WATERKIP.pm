Bundle::WATERKIP - A mono repo for perl scripts and modules which WATERKIP likes

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cpanm Bundle::WATERKIP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module serves a simple purpose. It is the main repository for all Perl
related things WATERKIP has come to rely on. It installs modules that I want
for development purposes. And it ships the bin scripts I want to have on my
machines.
