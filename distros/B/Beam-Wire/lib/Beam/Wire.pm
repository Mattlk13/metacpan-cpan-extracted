#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod Beam::Wire is a configuration module and a dependency injection
#pod container. In addition to complex data structures, Beam::Wire configures
#pod and creates plain old Perl objects.
#pod
#pod A dependency injection (DI) container creates an inversion of control:
#pod Instead of manually creating all the dependent objects (also called
#pod "services") before creating the main object that we actually want, a DI
#pod container handles that for us: We describe the relationships between
#pod objects, and the objects get built as needed.
#pod
#pod Dependency injection is sometimes called the opposite of garbage
#pod collection. Rather than ensure objects are destroyed in the right order,
#pod dependency injection makes sure objects are created in the right order.
#pod
#pod Using Beam::Wire in your application brings great flexibility,
#pod allowing users to easily add their own code to customize how your
#pod project behaves.
#pod
#pod For an L<introduction to the Beam::Wire service configuration format,
#pod see Beam::Wire::Help::Config|Beam::Wire::Help::Config>.

#pod
#pod See L<Beam::Wire::Help::Config for details on what the configuration

#pod =attr meta_prefix
#pod

#pod =method get
#pod
#pod     my $service = $wire->get( $name );
#pod     my $service = $wire->get( $name, %overrides )
#pod
#pod The get method resolves and returns the service named C<$name>, creating
#pod it, if necessary, with L<the create_service method|/create_service>.
#pod
#pod C<%overrides> is an optional list of name-value pairs. If specified,
#pod get() will create an new, anonymous service that extends the named
#pod service with the given config overrides. For example:
#pod
#pod     # test.pl
#pod     use Beam::Wire;
#pod     my $wire = Beam::Wire->new(
#pod         config => {
#pod             foo => {
#pod                 args => {
#pod                     text => 'Hello, World!',
#pod                 },
#pod             },
#pod         },
#pod     );
#pod
#pod     my $foo = $wire->get( 'foo', args => { text => 'Hello, Chicago!' } );
#pod     print $foo; # prints "Hello, Chicago!"
#pod
#pod This allows you to create factories out of any service, overriding service
#pod configuration at run-time.
#pod
#pod If C<$name> contains a slash (C</>) character (e.g. C<foo/bar>), the left
#pod side (C<foo>) will be used as the name of an inner container, and the
#pod right side (C<bar>) is a service inside that container. For example,
#pod these two lines are equivalent:
#pod
#pod     $bar = $wire->get( 'foo/bar' );
#pod     $bar = $wire->get( 'foo' )->get( 'bar' );
#pod
#pod Inner containers can be nested as deeply as desired (C<foo/bar/baz/fuzz>).

#pod =method create_service
#pod
#pod     my $service = $wire->create_service( $name, %config );
#pod
#pod Create the service with the given C<$name> and C<%config>. Config can
#pod contain the following keys:
#pod
#pod =over 4
#pod
#pod =item class
#pod
#pod The class name of an object to create. Can be combined with C<method>,
#pod and C<args>. An object of any class can be created with Beam::Wire.
#pod
#pod =item args
#pod
#pod The arguments to the constructor method. Used with C<class> and
#pod C<method>. Can be a simple value, or a reference to an array or
#pod hash which will be dereferenced and passed in to the constructor
#pod as a list.
#pod
#pod If the C<class> consumes the L<Beam::Service role|Beam::Service>,
#pod the service's C<name> and C<container> will be added to the C<args>.
#pod
#pod =item method
#pod
#pod The method to call to create the object. Only used with C<class>.
#pod Defaults to C<"new">.
#pod
#pod This can also be an array of hashes which describe a list of methods
#pod that will be called on the object. The first method should create the
#pod object, and each subsequent method can be used to modify the object. The
#pod hashes should contain a C<method> key, which is a string containing the
#pod method to call, and optionally C<args> and C<return> keys. The C<args>
#pod key works like the top-level C<args> key, above. The optional C<return>
#pod key can have the special value C<"chain">, which will use the return
#pod value from the method as the value for the service (L<The tutorial shows
#pod examples of this|Beam::Wire::Help::Config/Multiple Constructor
#pod Methods>).
#pod
#pod If an array is used, the top-level C<args> key is not used.
#pod
#pod =item value
#pod
#pod The value of this service. Can be a simple value, or a reference to an
#pod array or hash. This value will be simply returned by this method, and is
#pod mostly useful when using container files.
#pod
#pod C<value> can not be used with C<class> or C<extends>.
#pod
#pod =item config
#pod
#pod The path to a configuration file, relative to L<the dir attribute|/dir>.
#pod The file will be read with L<Config::Any>, and the resulting data
#pod structure returned.
#pod
#pod =item extends
#pod
#pod The name of a service to extend. The named service's configuration will
#pod be merged with this configuration (via L<the merge_config
#pod method|/merge_config>).
#pod
#pod This can be used in place of the C<class> key if the extended configuration
#pod contains a class.
#pod
#pod =item with
#pod
#pod Compose a role into the object's class before creating the object. This
#pod can be a single string, or an array reference of strings which are roles
#pod to combine.
#pod
#pod This uses L<Moo::Role|Moo::Role> and L<the create_class_with_roles
#pod method|Role::Tiny/create_class_with_roles>, which should work with any
#pod class (as it uses L<the Role::Tiny module|Role::Tiny> under the hood).
#pod
#pod This can be used with the C<class> key.
#pod
#pod =item on
#pod
#pod Attach an event handler to a L<Beam::Emitter subclass|Beam::Emitter>. This
#pod is an array of hashes of event names and handlers. A handler is made from
#pod a service reference (C<$ref> or an anonymous service), and a subroutine to
#pod call on that service (C<$sub>).
#pod
#pod For example:
#pod
#pod     emitter:
#pod         class: My::Emitter
#pod         on:
#pod             - my_event:
#pod                 $ref: my_handler
#pod                 $sub: on_my_event
#pod
#pod This can be used with the C<class> key.
#pod

#pod This method uses L<the parse_args method|/parse_args> to parse the C<args> key,
#pod L<resolving references|resolve_ref> as needed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Beam::Wire is a configuration module and a dependency injection
container. In addition to complex data structures, Beam::Wire configures
and creates plain old Perl objects.

A dependency injection (DI) container creates an inversion of control:
Instead of manually creating all the dependent objects (also called
"services") before creating the main object that we actually want, a DI
container handles that for us: We describe the relationships between
objects, and the objects get built as needed.

Dependency injection is sometimes called the opposite of garbage
collection. Rather than ensure objects are destroyed in the right order,
dependency injection makes sure objects are created in the right order.

Using Beam::Wire in your application brings great flexibility,
allowing users to easily add their own code to customize how your
project behaves.

For an L<introduction to the Beam::Wire service configuration format,
see Beam::Wire::Help::Config|Beam::Wire::Help::Config>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 file

The path of the file where services are configured (typically a YAML
file). The file's contents should be a single hashref. The keys are
service names, and the values are L<service
configurations|Beam::Wire::Help::Config>.

=head2 dir

The directory path to use when searching for inner container files.
Defaults to the directory which contains the file specified by the
L<file attribute|/file>.

=head2 config

The raw configuration data. By default, this data is loaded by
L<Config::Any|Config::Any> using the file specified by the L<file attribute|/file>.

See L<Beam::Wire::Help::Config for details on what the configuration
data structure looks like|Beam::Wire::Help::Config>.

If you don't want to load a file, you can specify this attribute in the
Beam::Wire constructor.

=head2 services

A hashref of cached services built from the L<configuration|/config>. If
you want to inject a pre-built object for other services to depend on,
add it here.

=head2 meta_prefix

The character that begins a meta-property inside of a service's C<args>. This
includes C<$ref>, C<$path>, C<$method>, and etc...

The default value is C<$>. The empty string is allowed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get

    my $service = $wire->get( $name );
    my $service = $wire->get( $name, %overrides )

The get method resolves and returns the service named C<$name>, creating
it, if necessary, with L<the create_service method|/create_service>.

C<%overrides> is an optional list of name-value pairs. If specified,
get() will create an new, anonymous service that extends the named
service with the given config overrides. For example:

    # test.pl
    use Beam::Wire;
    my $wire = Beam::Wire->new(
        config => {
            foo => {
                args => {
                    text => 'Hello, World!',
                },
            },
        },
    );

    my $foo = $wire->get( 'foo', args => { text => 'Hello, Chicago!' } );
    print $foo; # prints "Hello, Chicago!"

This allows you to create factories out of any service, overriding service
configuration at run-time.

If C<$name> contains a slash (C</>) character (e.g. C<foo/bar>), the left
side (C<foo>) will be used as the name of an inner container, and the
right side (C<bar>) is a service inside that container. For example,
these two lines are equivalent:

    $bar = $wire->get( 'foo/bar' );
    $bar = $wire->get( 'foo' )->get( 'bar' );

Inner containers can be nested as deeply as desired (C<foo/bar/baz/fuzz>).

=head2 set

    $wire->set( $name => $service );

The set method configures and stores the specified C<$service> with the
specified C<$name>. Use this to add or replace built services.

Like L<the get() method, above|/get>, C<$name> can contain a slash (C</>)
character to traverse through nested containers.

=head2 get_config

    my $conf = $wire->get_config( $name );

Get the config with the given C<$name>. Like L<the get() method,
above|/get>, C<$name> can contain slash (C</>) characters to traverse
through nested containers.

=head2 normalize_config

    my $out_conf = $self->normalize_config( $in_conf );

Normalize the given C<$in_conf> into to hash that L<the create_service
method|/create_service> expects. This method allows a service to be
defined with prefixed meta-names (C<$class> instead of C<class>) and
the arguments specified without prefixes.

For example, these two services are identical.

    foo:
        class: Foo
        args:
            fizz: buzz

    foo:
        $class: Foo
        fizz: buzz

The C<$in_conf> must be a hash, and must already pass L<an is_meta
check|/is_meta>.

=head2 create_service

    my $service = $wire->create_service( $name, %config );

Create the service with the given C<$name> and C<%config>. Config can
contain the following keys:

=over 4

=item class

The class name of an object to create. Can be combined with C<method>,
and C<args>. An object of any class can be created with Beam::Wire.

=item args

The arguments to the constructor method. Used with C<class> and
C<method>. Can be a simple value, or a reference to an array or
hash which will be dereferenced and passed in to the constructor
as a list.

If the C<class> consumes the L<Beam::Service role|Beam::Service>,
the service's C<name> and C<container> will be added to the C<args>.

=item method

The method to call to create the object. Only used with C<class>.
Defaults to C<"new">.

This can also be an array of hashes which describe a list of methods
that will be called on the object. The first method should create the
object, and each subsequent method can be used to modify the object. The
hashes should contain a C<method> key, which is a string containing the
method to call, and optionally C<args> and C<return> keys. The C<args>
key works like the top-level C<args> key, above. The optional C<return>
key can have the special value C<"chain">, which will use the return
value from the method as the value for the service (L<The tutorial shows
examples of this|Beam::Wire::Help::Config/Multiple Constructor
Methods>).

If an array is used, the top-level C<args> key is not used.

=item value

The value of this service. Can be a simple value, or a reference to an
array or hash. This value will be simply returned by this method, and is
mostly useful when using container files.

C<value> can not be used with C<class> or C<extends>.

=item config

The path to a configuration file, relative to L<the dir attribute|/dir>.
The file will be read with L<Config::Any>, and the resulting data
structure returned.

=item extends

The name of a service to extend. The named service's configuration will
be merged with this configuration (via L<the merge_config
method|/merge_config>).

This can be used in place of the C<class> key if the extended configuration
contains a class.

=item with

Compose a role into the object's class before creating the object. This
can be a single string, or an array reference of strings which are roles
to combine.

This uses L<Moo::Role|Moo::Role> and L<the create_class_with_roles
method|Role::Tiny/create_class_with_roles>, which should work with any
class (as it uses L<the Role::Tiny module|Role::Tiny> under the hood).

This can be used with the C<class> key.

=item on

Attach an event handler to a L<Beam::Emitter subclass|Beam::Emitter>. This
is an array of hashes of event names and handlers. A handler is made from
a service reference (C<$ref> or an anonymous service), and a subroutine to
call on that service (C<$sub>).

For example:

    emitter:
        class: My::Emitter
        on:
            - my_event:
                $ref: my_handler
                $sub: on_my_event

This can be used with the C<class> key.

=back

This method uses L<the parse_args method|/parse_args> to parse the C<args> key,
L<resolving references|resolve_ref> as needed.

=head2 merge_config

    my %merged = $wire->merge_config( %config );

If C<%config> contains an C<extends> key, merge the extended config together
with this one, returning the merged service configuration. This works recursively,
so a service can extend a service that extends another service just fine.

When merging, hashes are combined, with the child configuration taking
precedence. The C<args> key is handled specially to allow a hash of
args to be merged.

The configuration returned is a safe copy and can be modified without
effecting the original config.

=head2 parse_args

    my @args = $wire->parse_args( $for_name, $class, $args );

Parse the arguments (C<$args>) for the given service (C<$for_name>) with
the given class (C<$class>).

C<$args> can be an array reference, a hash reference, or a simple
scalar. The arguments will be searched for references using L<the
find_refs method|/find_refs>, and then a list of arguments will be
returned, ready to pass to the object's constructor.

Nested containers are handled specially by this method: Their inner
references are not resolved by the parent container. This ensures that
references are always relative to the container they're in.

=head2 find_refs

    my @resolved = $wire->find_refs( $for_name, @args );

Go through the C<@args> and recursively resolve any references and
services found inside, returning the resolved result. References are
identified with L<the is_meta method|/is_meta>.

If a reference contains a C<$ref> key, it will be resolved by L<the
resolve_ref method|/resolve_ref>. Otherwise, the reference will be
treated as an anonymous service, and passed directly to L<the
create_service method|/create_service>.

This is used when L<creating a service|create_service> to ensure all
dependencies are created first.

=head2 is_meta

    my $is_meta = $wire->is_meta( $ref_hash, $root );

Returns true if the given hash reference describes some kind of
Beam::Wire service. This is used to identify service configuration
hashes inside of larger data structures.

A service hash reference must contain at least one key, and must either
contain a L<prefixed|/meta_prefix> key that could create or reference an
object (one of C<class>, C<extends>, C<config>, C<value>, or C<ref>) or,
if the C<$root> flag exists, be made completely of unprefixed meta keys
(as returned by L<the get_meta_names method|/get_meta_names>).

The C<$root> flag is used by L<the get method|/get> to allow unprefixed
meta keys in the top-level hash values.

=head2 get_meta_names

    my %meta_keys = $wire->get_meta_names;

Get all the possible service keys with the L<meta prefix|/meta_prefix> already
attached.

=head2 resolve_ref

    my @value = $wire->resolve_ref( $for_name, $ref_hash );

Resolves the given dependency from the configuration hash (C<$ref_hash>)
for the named service (C<$for_name>). Reference hashes contain the
following keys:

=over 4

=item $ref

The name of a service in the container. Required.

=item $path

A data path to pick some data out of the reference. Useful with C<value>
and C<config> services.

    # container.yml
    bounties:
        value:
            malcolm: 50000
            zoe: 35000
            simon: 100000

    captain:
        class: Person
        args:
            name: Malcolm Reynolds
            bounty:
                $ref: bounties
                $path: /malcolm

=item $call

Call a method on the referenced object and use the resulting value. This
may be a string, which will be the method name to call, or a hash with
C<$method> and C<$args>, which are the method name to call and the
arguments to that method, respectively.

    captain:
        class: Person
        args:
            name: Malcolm Reynolds
            location:
                $ref: beacon
                $call: get_location
            bounty:
                $ref: news
                $call:
                    $method: get_bounty
                    $args:
                        name: mreynolds

=back

=head2 fix_refs

    my @fixed = $wire->fix_refs( $for_name, @args );

Similar to L<the find_refs method|/find_refs>. This method searches
through the C<@args> and recursively fixes any reference paths to be
absolute. References are identified with L<the is_meta
method|/is_meta>.

This is used by L<the get_config method|/get_config> to ensure that the
configuration can be passed directly in to L<the create_service
method|create_service>.

=head2 new

    my $wire = Beam::Wire->new( %attributes );

Create a new container.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

If there is an error internal to Beam::Wire, an exception will be thrown. If there is an
error with creating a service or calling a method, the exception thrown will be passed-
through unaltered.

=head2 Beam::Wire::Exception

The base exception class

=head2 Beam::Wire::Exception::Constructor

An exception creating a Beam::Wire object

=head2 Beam::Wire::Exception::Config

An exception loading the configuration file.

=head2 Beam::Wire::Exception::Service

An exception with service information inside

=head2 Beam::Wire::Exception::NotFound

The requested service or configuration was not found.

=head2 Beam::Wire::Exception::InvalidConfig
