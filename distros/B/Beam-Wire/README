Beam::Wire

Beam::Wire is a configuration module and a dependency injection
container. In addition to complex data structures, Beam::Wire configures
and creates plain old Perl objects.

A dependency injection (DI) container creates an inversion of control:
Instead of manually creating all the dependent objects (also called
"services") before creating the main object that we actually want, a DI
container handles that for us: We describe the relationships between
objects, and the objects get built as needed.

Dependency injection is sometimes called the opposite of garbage
collection. Rather than ensure objects are destroyed in the right order,
dependency injection makes sure objects are created in the right order.

Using Beam::Wire in your application brings great flexibility, allowing
users to easily add their own code to customize how your project
behaves.

For an introduction to the Beam::Wire service configuration format, see
Beam::Wire::Help::Config.
