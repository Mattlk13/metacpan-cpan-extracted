=head1 NAME

bp_einfo - Query einfo to find all available databases or information about a specific database (field information or links to other NCBI databases).

=head1 VERSION

version 1.75

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 bp_einfo [-d database] [-f Field Code] [-l Link Name] [-o outfile]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command line options:

  -e/--email
        Valid email (required by NCBI policy)

  -d/--db/--database
        NCBI database to query
        (default = none, which shows available databases)

  -f/--field
        print out information about a specific field code
        (default = none)

  -l/--link
        print out information about a specific link name
        (default = none)

  -o/--out
        outfile
        (default = STDOUT)

  -h/--help
        show this documentation

As per NCBI's policy regarding eutils access, a valid email is required.  This
is not enforced here (if one is provided you will get a standard warning), but
don't be surprised if this doesn't work after June 1, 2010 unless one is
supplied.

If -d is not specified, field and link arguments are ignored and all available
databases are printed instead.

If either link names or field codes (or both) are specified, nothing else is
printed out (only the info requested).  You can specify as many fields and/or
links as you want by using multiple -f/-l E<lt>ARGE<gt> on the command line.
