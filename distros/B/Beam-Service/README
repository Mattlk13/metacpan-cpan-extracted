Beam::Service

This role adds extra functionality to an object that is going to be used
as a service in a Beam::Wire container. While any object can be
configured with Beam::Wire, consuming the Beam::Service role allows an
object to know its own name and to access the container it was
configured in to fetch other objects that it needs.
