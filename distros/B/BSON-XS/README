    Version v0.8.0 was the final feature release of the MongoDB BSON::XS
    library and v0.8.4 is the final patch release.

    As of August 13, 2020, the MongoDB Perl driver and related libraries
    have reached end of life and are no longer supported by MongoDB. See the

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains an XS implementation for BSON encoding and
    decoding. There is no public API. Use the BSON module and it will choose
    the best implementation for you.
