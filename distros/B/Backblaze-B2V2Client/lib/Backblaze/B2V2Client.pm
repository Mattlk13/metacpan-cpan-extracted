Backblaze::B2V2Client - Client library for the Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage Service V2 API.  

=head1 VERSION

1.0 - Initial working version.

	# create an API client object

	$b2client = Backblaze::B2V2Client->new(
		$application_key_id, $application_key
	);

	# you can leave off the directory to just have the file contents into

=head1 DESCRIPTION / SET UP

This module should help you create buckets and store files in the 
Backblaze B2 cloud storage service using V2 of their API.

Backblaze makes it easy to sign up for B2 from here:

	https://www.backblaze.com/b2/sign-up.html

Then enable the B2 service as per these instructions:

	https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/quick_account.html

Next, visit the 'App Keys' section of the 'My Account' area, and look for
the 'Add a New Application Key' button to create an application key.  You
will need a key with Read and Write access.  Be sure to note the Application Key 
ID  as well as the Application Key itself. They do not show you that Application 
Key again, so copy it immediately.

Please store the Application Key pair in a secure way, preferably encrypted 
when not in use by your software.

# NOTE: BACKBLAZE B2 IS NOW S3-COMPATIBLE

Backblaze has added an S3-compatible API, which you can read about here:

	https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/s3_compatible_api.html

They are continuing to support their native B2 API, so I will continue
to use and support this module.  I have not tested the S3 modules with
Backblaze, but if you already have an S3 integration, it is work checking
out how Paws::S3 or Awes::S3 works with Backblaze.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates the B2 client object and initiates an API session with B2.

Requires two arguments: the Application Key ID and Application Key 
obtained from Backblaze.  

=head2 b2_download_file_by_id

Retrieves a file plus metadata given the GUID of that file.  The first 
argument is required and will be the file's GUID.  If you would like
to auto-save the file, provide a path to an existing directory as the 
second argument.  

Regardless of auto-save, the file's raw contents will be placed in to 
$b2client->{b2_response}{file_contents} and the following keys
will be populated under $b2client->{b2_response}:

	Content-Length
	Content-Type
	X-Bz-File-Id
	X-Bz-File-Name
	X-Bz-Content-Sha1

See https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_download_file_by_id.html

=head2 b2_download_file_by_name

Works like b2_download_file_by_id() except that it expects the bucket name
and file name as arguments.  The optional third argument is an existing
directory path for auto-saving the file.

See https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_download_file_by_name.html

=head2 b2_upload_file

Uploads a new file into B2.  Accepts a hash of arguments.  The name
of the destination bucket must be provided in 'bucket_name'.
If you would like to upload a file already saved on disk, specify
the complete file path in 'file_location'.  Alternatively, if the file
is loaded up into a scalar, provide the new file name in 'new_file_name'
and assign the loaded scalar into 'file_contents'.

Example 1: Uploading from a file on disk:

	$b2client->b2_upload_file(
		'bucket_name' => 'GingerAnna', 
		'file_location' => '/opt/majestica/tmp/ginger_was_perfect.jpg',
	); 	

Example 2: Uploading when the file is loaded into a scalar:

	$b2client->b2_upload_file(
		'bucket_name' => 'GingerAnna', 
		'new_file_name' => 'ginger_was_perfect.jpg',
		'file_contents' => $file_contents
	); 	

NOTE: If you are going to use the 'file_contents' method, it's best
to load the scalar using the 'slurp_raw' method in Path::Tiny.
(I believe 'read_file' in File::Slurp will work, but have yet to test.)

You can also pass a 'content-type' key with the MIME type for the new
file.  The default is 'b2/auto'.

Upon a successful upload, the new GUID for the file will be available 
in $b2client->{b2_response}{fileId} .
	
See: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_upload_file.html

=head2 b2_list_file_names

Retrieves an array of file information hashes for a given bucket name.
That array is added to @{ $b2client->{buckets}{$bucket_name}{files} }.  

See https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_list_file_names.html ,
especially the section for 'Response' to see what is included for those
file info hashes.

Note that B2 limits this response to 1000 entries, so if you have a very
large bucket, you can call this method several times and check the 
value in $b2client->{buckets}{$bucket_name}{next_file_name} after each call.

Example:

	$b2client->b2_list_file_names('MyBucketName');

=head2 b2_get_file_info

Given a GUID for a file, will retrieve its info hash and load into
$b2client->{file_info}{$file_id}.

See https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_get_file_info.html ,
particularly the section for 'Response' to see what is provided.

Example:

	$b2client->b2_get_file_info('AN84_CHAR_GUID_FROM_B2');

=head2 b2_bucket_maker

Creates a new bucket in your B2 account, given the name for the new
bucket.  The bucket type will be set to 'allPrivate'.

Will retrieve the new bucket's ID into:
	
	$b2client->{buckets}{$bucket_name}{bucket_id}

See: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_create_bucket.html

Example:

	$b2client->b2_bucket_maker('NewBucketName');

=head2 b2_delete_bucket

Deletes a bucket from your B2 account, provided that it is empty.  
Requires the target bucket's name as the argument.

See: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_delete_bucket.html	

Example:

	$b2client->b2_delete_bucket('DeletingBucketName');	

=head2 b2_delete_file_version

Deletes a version of a file, AKA a stored object.  If you use unique
file names for each file you upload, then one version equals one file.
If you upload multiple files with the same name under a single bucket, 
you will create multiple versions of a particular file in B2.  

The required arguments are the file name and the file ID.

Example:

	$b2client->b2_delete_file_version('SomeFileName.ext','AN84_CHAR_GUID_FROM_B2');

=head2 b2_talker / b2_get_upload_url  / b2_list_buckets

b2_talker() handles all the communications with B2.  
You should be able to use this to make calls not explicitly
provided by this library.

If b2_talker() gets a 200 HTTP status from B2, then the call went
great, the JSON response will be loaded into $b2client->{b2_response},
and $b2client->{current_status} will be set to 'OK'.

If a 200 is not received from B2, $b2client->{current_status} will be
set to 'Error' and a hash error details will be added to 
@{ $b2client->{errors} }.  That hash usually includes the
called URL, the returned status code, and the error message.

Note that the base URL for this API session will be stored
under $b2client->{api_url} so that you build a URL like so:

$list_buckets_url = $b2client->{api_url}.'/b2api/v2/b2_list_buckets';

Example of a GET API request:

	$b2client->b2_talker(
		'url' => 'https://SomeB2.API.URL?with=GETparams',
		'authorization' => $b2client->{account_authorization_token},		
	);

Example of a POST API request:

	$b2client->b2_talker(
		'url' => 'https://SomeB2.API.URL',
		'authorization' => $b2client->{account_authorization_token},		
		'post_params' => {
			'param1_name' => 'param1_value',
			'param2_name' => 'param2_value',
			'param3_name' => 'param3_value',
		},
	);

Almost all the API calls use the Account Authorization Token for the
authorization header, but the file uploader calls require a bucket-specific
token and upload URL.  You can retrieve these via b2_get_upload_url()
with the bucket name as an argument.

Example:

	$b2client->b2_get_upload_url('MyBucketName');

This populates:

	$b2client->{bucket_info}{'MyBucketName'} = {
		'upload_url' => $b2client->{b2_response}{uploadUrl},
		'authorization_token' => $b2client->{b2_response}{authorizationToken},
	};

Note: You have to call b2_get_upload_url on a bucket for each file 
upload operation.  My b2_upload_file method does that for you, so that's
just FYI if you roll your own.

See: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_get_upload_url.html
	
If you need the ID for one or more buckets, you can use b2_list_buckets.  If
a bucket name is provided, only that bucket's ID will be retrieved.  If no
argument is provided, all the ID's will be retrieved for all buckets in your 
account.

Example:

	$b2client->b2_list_buckets('MyBucketName');

You now have $b2client->{buckets}{'MyBucketName'}{bucket_id}

See: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_list_buckets.html
