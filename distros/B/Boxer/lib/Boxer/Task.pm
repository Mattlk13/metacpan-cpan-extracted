=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for L<Boxer> tasks.

Tasks coerce, validate, and process application commands.

Currently implemented tasks:

=over 4

=item *

L<Classify|Boxer::Task::Classify>

=item *

L<Serialize|Boxer::Task::Serialize>

=item *

L<Bootstrap|Boxer::Task::Bootstrap>

=back


=head1 IDEAS

Tasks are separated from commands
to allow for different front-end interfaces,
even if currently only a single command-line tool is provided.

=head2 wrappers

Might be useful to provide wrappers for existing command-line tools,
preserving full behavior of the underlying tool
only extending it with relevant boxer options.

Examples:

=over 4

=item *

C<debootstrap-boxer [...] [--boxer-node=NODE[,NODE2...]] [...]>

=back

=head2 web

Would be cool to offer a web service
where you could request a customized system image
to be generated for you on demand.
