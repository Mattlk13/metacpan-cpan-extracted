Boxer installation
==================

Preparations
------------

On Debian 8+ (Jessie or newer), or Debian unstable (Sid),
boxer is available as a regular package:

    apt install boxer

Alternatively install from CPAN, and only a helper tool from Debian:

    cpanm Boxer
    apt install reclass


Usage
-----

    cp /usr/share/doc/boxer/examples/nodes/parl-greens.yml .
    boxer compose parl-greens

NB! If code was pulled from CPAN or git, you may need to adapt location
of example file and environment variables PATH PYTHONPATH PERL5LIB.


Development
-----------

    git clone https://salsa.debian.org/boxer-team/boxer
    cd Boxer
    PERL5LIB=lib bin/boxer compose --skeldir share/skel --datadir examples parl-greens

You may want to explore the larger dataset in active use:

    git clone git://source.jones.dk/blends

System compositions are expressed using reclass.  See the README in the
sample data dir for more info on its structure.
