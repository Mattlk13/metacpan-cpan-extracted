NAME
    Bencher::Scenario::FileWhichCached - Benchmark File::Which::Cached

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Bencher::Scenario::FileWhichCached (from Perl distribution
    Bencher-Scenario-FileWhichCached), released on 2019-06-08.

SYNOPSIS
    To run benchmark with default option:

     % bencher -m FileWhichCached

    To run module startup overhead benchmark:

     % bencher --module-startup -m FileWhichCached

    For more options (dump scenario, list/include/exclude/add participants,
    list/include/exclude/add datasets, etc), see bencher or run "bencher
    --help".

DESCRIPTION
    Packaging a benchmark script as a Bencher scenario makes it convenient
    to include/exclude/add participants/datasets (either via CLI or Perl
    code), send the result to a central repository, among others . See
    Bencher and bencher (CLI) for more details.
