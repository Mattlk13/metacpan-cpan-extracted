=head1 NAME

Bencher::Scenario::FileWhichCached - Benchmark File::Which::Cached

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of Bencher::Scenario::FileWhichCached (from Perl distribution Bencher-Scenario-FileWhichCached), released on 2019-06-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To run benchmark with default option:

 % bencher -m FileWhichCached

To run module startup overhead benchmark:

 % bencher --module-startup -m FileWhichCached

For more options (dump scenario, list/include/exclude/add participants, list/include/exclude/add datasets, etc), see L<bencher> or run C<bencher --help>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Packaging a benchmark script as a Bencher scenario makes it convenient to include/exclude/add participants/datasets (either via CLI or Perl code), send the result to a central repository, among others . See L<Bencher> and L<bencher> (CLI) for more details.

=head1 BENCHMARKED MODULES

Version numbers shown below are the versions used when running the sample benchmark.

L<File::Which> 1.22

L<File::Which::Cached> 1.03
