DESCRIPTION

    Conclusion: Testing on my system (IPC::System::Options 0.24, perl:
    5.22.0, CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz (4 cores)) shows
    the overhead to be ~40μs (0.04ms) so for benchmarking commands that
    have overhead in the range of 10-100ms we normally don't need to worry
    about the overhead of IPC::System::Option (0.04-0.4%) when we are using
    default precision (~1%).
