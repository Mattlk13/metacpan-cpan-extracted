# These are merged into the pages tree as URIs relative to the file
# base (e.g. auth.yaml + login = /auth/login).  This is controlled by
# the 'schema' entry in ../pages.yaml

login:
  name: Login

logout: 
  name: Logout

# This has an abssolute URI so is resolved as just /register, not /auth/register
