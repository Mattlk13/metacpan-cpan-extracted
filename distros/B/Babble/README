NAME

    Babble - EXPERIMENTAL Babel-like for perl

VERSION

    0.090008

SYNOPSIS

    If you're here for help dealing with changes in perl's signatures
    syntax, look at App::sigfix.

    If you're here to try out Babble itself, you'll want to do

      use Babble::Filter qw(::CorePluginName External::Plugin::Name);

    to have it rewrite your code on the fly, or

      perl -MBabble::Filter=::CorePluginName,External::Plugin::Name  \
        -0777 -pe babble lib/MyFile.pm >lib/MyFile.pmc

    to rewrite for shipping.

    Current core plugins are ::CoreSignatures, ::State, ::DefinedOr,
    ::PostfixDeref, ::SubstituteAndReturn (s///r), ::Ellipsis,
    ::PackageBlock, ::PackageVersion, and ::SKT (which is a start on
    rewriting Syntax::Keyword::Try). For an example of an external plugin,
    see Method::Signatures::PP.

    Not for 'normal' use but still interesting, ::Sigify attempts to
    convert simple @_ unrolls into signatures - best used on its own,
    followed by applying App::sigfix if you need the 5.22-5.26
    oldsignatures style.
