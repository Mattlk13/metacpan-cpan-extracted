=head1 NAME

Bencher::Scenario::File::Which::Cached - Benchmark File::Which::Cached

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of Bencher::Scenario::File::Which::Cached (from Perl distribution Bencher-Scenario-File-Which-Cached), released on 2022-03-19.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To run benchmark with default option:

 % bencher -m File::Which::Cached

To run module startup overhead benchmark:

 % bencher --module-startup -m File::Which::Cached

For more options (dump scenario, list/include/exclude/add participants, list/include/exclude/add datasets, etc), see L<bencher> or run C<bencher --help>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Packaging a benchmark script as a Bencher scenario makes it convenient to include/exclude/add participants/datasets (either via CLI or Perl code), send the result to a central repository, among others . See L<Bencher> and L<bencher> (CLI) for more details.

=head1 BENCHMARKED MODULES

Version numbers shown below are the versions used when running the sample benchmark.

L<File::Which> 1.27

L<File::Which::Cached> 1.03

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Bencher-Scenario-File-Which-Cached>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
