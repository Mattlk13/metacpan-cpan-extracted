Bio::BioStudio

	Bio::GeneDesign

DEPENDENCIES

The Perl libraries not in the Perl core that BioStudio requires are Text::Diff, 
Time::Format, Exception::Class, Digest::MD5, URI::Escape, Readonly, and 
YAML::Tiny. All of these perl libraries can be installed by BioStudio at install 
time or beforehand with cpan.

You need BioPerl-live, from github and not from cpan.
  git clone https://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-live.git
  cd bioperl-live/
  sudo perl Build.PL
  sudo ./Build installdeps
  sudo ./Build test
  sudo ./Build install
  cd ../
  git clone https://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-run.git
  cd bioperl-run/
  sudo perl Build.PL
  sudo ./Build installdeps
  sudo ./Build install

OPTIONAL PACKAGES

If a graphical user interface is desired, the excellent GBrowse2 is available 
and easily installed from https://github.com/GMOD/GBrowse.

For static graphic representations of chromosomes BioStudio requires the Cairo 
library and FreeType2 as well as the associated perl bindings Cairo and 
Font::FreeType.

BLAST+ is required for sequence comparison and for PCRTag generation. Make sure 
you are using BLAST+ and not any older set of BLAST scripts. The package is 
available from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/.

BioStudio's performance on large genomes is drastically improved by the indexing 
annotations in a relational database. MySQL 5.6 or Postgres 9.3 are supported. 
Make sure to install the perl libraries DBI and either DBD::mysql or DBD::Pg.
