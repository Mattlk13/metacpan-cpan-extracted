NAME
    Bitcoin::BIP39 - A BIP39 implementation in Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Bitcoin::BIP39 (from Perl
    distribution Bitcoin-BIP39), released on 2018-01-06.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an implementation of BIP39 (mnemonic phrase). Features:

    *   Ability to choose non-English wordlist

        As long as the appropriate "WordList::<LANG_CODE>::BIP39" module
        exists.

    Keywords: bitcoin, mnemonic code, mnemonic phrase, deterministic keys

  TODO
    *   Allow mispellings after the 4th character

    *   Language detection

FUNCTIONS
  bip39_mnemonic_to_entropy
    Usage:

     bip39_mnemonic_to_entropy(%args) -> any

    Convert BIP39 mnemonic phrase to entropy.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   encoding => *str* (default: "hex")

    *   language => *str* (default: "en")

        Pick which language wordlist to use.

        Will retrieve wordlist from "WordList::<LANG_CODE>::BIP39" Perl
        module.

        For Chinese (simplified), use "zh-simplified". For Chinese
        (traditional), use "zh-traditional".

    *   mnemonic* => *str*

        Mnemonic phrase.

    Return value: (any)

  entropy_to_bip39_mnemonic
    Usage:

     entropy_to_bip39_mnemonic(%args) -> any

    Convert entropy to BIP39 mnemonic phrase.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   entropy => *buf*

        Entropy (binary data).

    *   entropy_hex => *hexbuf*

        Entropy (hex-encoded).

    *   language => *str* (default: "en")

        Pick which language wordlist to use.

        Will retrieve wordlist from "WordList::<LANG_CODE>::BIP39" Perl
        module.

        For Chinese (simplified), use "zh-simplified". For Chinese
        (traditional), use "zh-traditional".

    Return value: (any)

  gen_bip39_mnemonic
    Usage:

     gen_bip39_mnemonic(%args) -> any

    Generate BIP39 mnemonic phrase.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   bits => *posint* (default: 128)

        Size of entropy in bits.

    *   language => *str* (default: "en")

        Pick which language wordlist to use.

        Will retrieve wordlist from "WordList::<LANG_CODE>::BIP39" Perl
        module.

        For Chinese (simplified), use "zh-simplified". For Chinese
        (traditional), use "zh-traditional".

    Return value: (any)
