Brocade::BSC Version 1.0.3

Brocade::BSC provides a perl API for interacting with the Brocade
Communications Systems port of the OpenDaylight Software-defined
networking controller ('Brocade SDN Controller').

Brocade::BSC is a port of the python library pybvc.  Version 1.0.4 is
pre-alpha software and provides functionality equivalent to version 1.0.2
of pybvc.

Brocade::BSC requires XML::Parser, and therefore depends indirectly on
James Clark's XML parser, expat, version 1.95.0 or greater.  The expat
development package may be downloaded from http://expat.sourceforge.net/
or installed using your OS package manager, for example

ubuntu$ sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev
fedora$ sudo yum install expat-devel
