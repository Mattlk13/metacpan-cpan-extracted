This module provides tools for building classes of readers and writers
for files that use tab separated fields with named typed fields.

Readers and writers use objects that have methods for accessing the
fields (using the field name as the method name).

Provided are a few (which will become more over time) definitions
for some files used in Bio-Informatics.

This module was being used internally at BoutrosLab and is being supported
