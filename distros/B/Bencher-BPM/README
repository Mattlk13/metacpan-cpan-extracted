DESCRIPTION

    This distribution includes the script bencher-bpm to run benchmark
    scenario with Benchmark (Benchmark.pm). It lacks bencher features like
    filtering participants/datasets/modules, listing participants/datasets
    or other actions. But it is small and does not have any non-core
    dependency.
