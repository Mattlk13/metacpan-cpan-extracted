DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to to define Bot::ChatBots for Trello
    <https://trello.com/>, a kanban boards online application.

    Strictly speaking, this module is a Mojolicious plugin that allows you
    to load and use Bot::ChatBots::Telegram::WebHook (see "SYNOPSIS" for a
    quick example), providing a way to receive actions from Trello.

    These modules rely upon Log::Any for emitting logging information; you
    are encouraged to read that module's documentation for further
    information. For what we are concerned, you have to remember that all
    logs will be lost unless you configure Log::Any, e.g. to send messages
    on standard output you can do this:

       use Log::Any::Adapter qw< Stderr >;

    If using the web hook, then you will probably want to send the logs
    together with Mojolicious's logs, like this:

       use Mojolicious::Lite;
       use Log::Any::Adapter;
       Log::Any::Adapter->set(MojoLog => logger => app->log);

    The configuration above relies on the presence of
    Log::Any::Adapter::MojoLog.

METHODS

    All the heavylifting is done by Bot::ChatBots::MojoPlugin.
