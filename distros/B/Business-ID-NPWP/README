NAME
    Business::ID::NPWP - Parse Indonesian taxpayer registration number
    (NPWP)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.092 of Business::ID::NPWP (from Perl
    distribution Business-ID-NPWP), released on 2024-07-11.

SYNOPSIS
     use Business::ID::NPWP qw(parse_npwp);

     my $res = parse_npwp(npwp => "02.183.241.5-000.000");

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to validate Indonesian taxpayer registration
    number, Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak (NPWP).

    NPWP is composed of 15 digits as follow:

     ST.sss.sss.C-OOO.BBB

    "S" is a serial number from 0-9 (so far haven't seen 7 and up, but it's
    probably possible).

    "T" denotes taxpayer type code (0 = government treasury [bendahara
    pemerintah], 1-3 = company/organization [badan], 4/6 = invidual
    entrepreneur [pengusaha perorangan], 5 = civil servants [pegawai negeri,
    PNS], 7-9 = individual employee [pegawai perorangan]).

    "sss.sss" is a 6-digit serial code for the taxpayer, probably starts
    from 1. It is distributed in blocks by the central tax office (kantor
    pusat dirjen pajak, DJP) to the local tax offices (kantor pelayanan
    pajak, KPP) throughout the country for allocation to taypayers.

    "C" is a check digit. It is apparently using Luhn (modulus 10) algorithm
    on the first 9 digits on the NPWP.

    "OOO" is a 3-digit local tax office code (kode KPP).

    "BBB" is a 3-digit branch code. 000 means the taxpayer is the sole
    branch (or, for individuals, the head of the family). 001, 002, and so
    on denote each branch.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_npwp
    Usage:

     parse_npwp(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Parse Indonesian taxpayer registration number (NPWP).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   allow_nik => *bool* (default: 0)

        Based on PMK 112 Tahun 2022, Indonesian citizenship registration
        number (NIK - nomor induk kependudukan) is also allowed as NPWP. NIK
        has 16 digits, while the traditional NPWP is 15 digits. A prefix 0
        will be added later so all NPWP will be 16 digits in the future.

        By default, NPWP is allowed to have 16 digits but the first digit
        must be 0. If this setting is set to true, NPWP with the first digit
        other than 0 is also allowed but will be checked for NIK validness.

    *   npwp* => *str*

        Input NPWP to be parsed.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
