DESCRIPTION

    This module can be used to validate Indonesian taxpayer registration
    number, Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak (NPWP).

    NPWP is composed of 15 digits as follow:

     ST.sss.sss.C-OOO.BBB

    S is a serial number from 0-9 (so far haven't seen 7 and up, but it's
    probably possible).

    T denotes taxpayer type code (0 = government treasury [bendahara
    pemerintah], 1-3 = company/organization [badan], 4/6 = invidual
    entrepreneur [pengusaha perorangan], 5 = civil servants [pegawai
    negeri, PNS], 7-9 = individual employee [pegawai perorangan]).

    sss.sss is a 6-digit serial code for the taxpayer, probably starts from
    1. It is distributed in blocks by the central tax office (kantor pusat
    dirjen pajak, DJP) to the local tax offices (kantor pelayanan pajak,
    KPP) throughout the country for allocation to taypayers.

    C is a check digit. It is apparently using Luhn (modulus 10) algorithm
    on the first 9 digits on the NPWP.

    OOO is a 3-digit local tax office code (kode KPP).

    BBB is a 3-digit branch code. 000 means the taxpayer is the sole branch
    (or, for individuals, the head of the family). 001, 002, and so on
    denote each branch.
