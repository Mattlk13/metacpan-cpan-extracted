FUNCTIONS
  parse_nkk
    Usage:

     parse_nkk(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Parse Indonesian family card number (nomor kartu keluarga, NKK).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   check_locality => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to check for known locality (city) codes.

    *   check_province => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to check for known province codes.

    *   nkk* => *str*

        Input NKK to be validated.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
