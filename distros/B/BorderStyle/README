NAME
    BorderStyle - Border styles

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    2

VERSION
    This document describes version 2.0.9 of BorderStyle (from Perl
    distribution BorderStyle), released on 2022-01-27.

DESCRIPTION
    This document specifies a way to create and use border styles

GLOSSARY
  border style class
  border style structure
SPECIFICATION
  Border style class
    Border style class must be put under "BorderStyle::*".
    Application-specific border styles should be put under
    "BorderStyle::MODULE::NAME::*" or "BorderStyle::APP::NAME::*".

    Border style structure must be put in the %BORDER package variable.

    Border style class must also provide these methods:

    *   new

        Usage:

         my $bs_obj = BorderStyle::NAME->new( [ %style_args ] );

        Arguments will depend on the border style class; each border style
        class can define what arguments they want to accept.

    *   get_struct

        Usage:

         my $bs_struct = BorderStyle::NAME->get_struct;
         my $bs_struct = $bs_obj->get_struct;

        Provide a method way of getting the "border style structure". Must
        also work as a static method. A client can also access the %BORDER
        package variable directly.

    *   get_args

        Usage:

         my $args = $bs_obj->get_args;

        Provide a method way of getting the arguments to the constructor
        (the style arguments). The official implementation
        BorderStyleBase::Constructor stores this in the 'args' key of the
        hash object, but the proper way to access the arguments should be
        via this method.

    *   get_border_char

        Usage:

         my $str = $bs->get_border_char($y, $x, $n, \%char_args);

        Get border character at a particular $y and $x position, duplicated
        $n times (defaults to 1). Per-character arguments can also be
        passed. Known per-character arguments: "rownum" (uint, row number,
        starts from 0), "colnum" (uint, column number, starts from 0).

  Border style structure
    Border style structure is a DefHash containing these keys:

    *   v

        Float, from DefHash, must be set to 2 (this specification version)

    *   name

        From DefHash.

    *   summary

        From DefHash.

    *   utf8

        Bool, must be set to true if the style uses non-ASCII UTF8 border
        character(s).

        Cannot be mixed with "box_chars".

    *   box_chars

        Bool, must be set to true if the style uses box-drawing character.
        When using box-drawing character, the characters in "chars" property
        must be specified using the VT100-style escape sequence without the
        prefix. For example, the top-left single border character must be
        specified as "l". For more details on box-drawing character,
        including the list of escape sequneces, see
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character>.

        Box-drawing characters must not be mixed with other characters
        (ASCII or UTF8).

    *   args

        A hash of argument names and specifications (each specification a
        DefHash) to specify which arguments a border style accept. This is
        similar to how Rinci::function specifies function arguments. An
        argument specification can contain these properties: "summary",
        "description", "schema", "req", "default".

    *   chars

        An array. Required. Format for the characters in "chars":

         [                           # y
         #x 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
           [A, B, C, D],             # 0 Top border characters (if drawing header rows)
           [E, F, G],                # 1 Vertical separators for header row
           [H, I, J, K, a, b, c, d], # 2 Separator between header row and first data row
           [L, M, N],                # 3 Vertical separators for data row
           [O, P, Q, R, e, f, g, h], # 4 Separator between data rows
           [S, T, U, V],             # 5 Bottom border characters

           [Ȧ, Ḃ, Ċ, Ḋ],             # 6 Top border characters (if not drawing header rows)
           [Ṣ, Ṭ, Ụ, Ṿ],             # 7 Bottom border characters (if drawing header rows but there are no data rows)

           [Ȯ, Ṗ, Ꝙ, Ṙ, ė, ḟ, ġ, ḣ], # 8 Separator between header rows
         ]

        When drawing border, below is how the border characters will be
        used:

         ABBBCBBBD        #0 Top border characters
         E   F   G        #1 Vertical separators for header row
         ȮṖṖṖꝘṖṖṖṘ        #8 Separator between header rows (if there are multiple header rows)
         E   F   G        #1 (another header row, if there are multiple header rows)
         HIIIJIIIK        #2 Separator between last header row and first data row
         L   M   N        #3 Vertical separators for data row
         OPPPQPPPR        #4 Separator between data rows
         L   M   N        #3 (another data row)
         STTTUTTTV        #5 Bottom border characters

        When not drawing header rows, these characters will be used instead:

         ȦḂḂḂĊḂḂḂḊ        #6 Top border characters (when not drawing header rows)
         L   M   N        #3 Vertical separators for data row
         OPPPQPPPR        #4 Separator between data rows
         L   M   N        #3 (another data row)
         OPPPQPPPR        #4 (another separator between data rows)
         L   M   N        #3 (another data row)
         STTTUTTTV        #5 Bottom border characters

        When drawing header rows and there are no data rows, these
        characters will be used:

         ABBBCBBBD        #0 Top border characters
         E   F   G        #1 Vertical separators for header row
         ȮṖṖṖꝘṖṖṖṘ        #8 Separator between header rows (if there are multiple header rows)
         E   F   G        #1 (another header row, if there are multiple header rows)
         ṢṬṬṬỤṬṬṬṾ        #7 Bottom border characters (when there are header rows but no data row)

        In table with column and row spans (demonstrates characters "a",
        "b", "e", "f", "g", "h"):

         ABBBBBBBCBBBCBBBD  ^
         E       F   F   G  |
         ȮṖṖṖṖṖṖṖꝘṖṖṖėṖṖṖṘ  |      # ė=no top line, ḟ=no bottom line

         L       M       N    |

         L       M       N    |
         STTTTTTTUTTTTTTTV    v

        In the case of a header-data separator line also having been cut by
        a multirow cell (note the "c" and "d" border character):

         ABBBBBBBBBCBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCBBBBBBBBBD  ^
         F         F                     F         G  |
         F         cIIIIIIIIIIaIIIIIIIIIId         G  +-------> header area
         L         M          M          F         N  |
         OPPPPPPPPPQPPPPPPPPPPQPPPPPPPPPPQPPPPPPPPPR  v  ^
         M         M          M          M         N     |
         M         M          M          M         N     +----> data area
         M         M          M          M         N     |
         STTTTTTTTTUTTTTTTTTTTUTTTTTTTTTTUTTTTTTTTTV     v

        A character can also be a coderef that will be called with "($self,
        $y, $x, $n, \%args)". See "Border style character".

  Border style character
    A border style character can be a single-character string, or a coderef
    to allow border style that is context-sensitive.

    If border style character is a coderef, it must return a
    single-character string and not another coderef. The coderef will be
    called with the same arguments passed to "get_border_char".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=BorderStyle>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
