=head1 NAME

Bencher::Scenario::SPVM::Sum - Benchmark SPVM (sum two numbers)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of Bencher::Scenario::SPVM::Sum (from Perl distribution Bencher-Scenarios-SPVM), released on 2017-06-21.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To run benchmark with default option:

 % bencher -m SPVM::Sum

For more options (dump scenario, list/include/exclude/add participants, list/include/exclude/add datasets, etc), see L<bencher> or run C<bencher --help>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Packaging a benchmark script as a Bencher scenario makes it convenient to include/exclude/add participants/datasets (either via CLI or Perl code), send the result to a central repository, among others . See L<Bencher> and L<bencher> (CLI) for more details.

=head1 BENCHMARKED MODULES

Version numbers shown below are the versions used when running the sample benchmark.

L<SPVM> 0.0201

L<SPVM::Examples> 0.001

=head1 SAMPLE BENCHMARK RESULTS

Run on: perl: I<< v5.26.0 >>, CPU: I<< Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz (4 cores) >>, OS: I<< GNU/Linux Debian version 8.0 >>, OS kernel: I<< Linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64 >>.

Benchmark with default options (C<< bencher -m SPVM::Sum >>):

=head1 BENCHMARK NOTES

Because SPVM needs to run code at CHECK phase, we need to run with e.g.:

 % PERL5OPT=-MSPVM=Examples::Sum bencher ...

And building this dist also needs similar workaround.
