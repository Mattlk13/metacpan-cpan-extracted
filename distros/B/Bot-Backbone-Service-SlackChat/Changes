    * Added the on_channel_joined helper to make it easy to react when a bot is
      invited to channels.
    * Fixed an internal work around that depended on
      https://github.com/mihyaeru21/p5-WebService-Slack-WebApi/issues/4 being
      fixed (which it was in the v0.04 release).
    * Added a documentation of the caveat that Slack does not allow bot accounts
      to invite themselves into channels.
    * Added tests!

    * Changed send_message to use Slack REST API rather than Slack RTM because
      the API allows for message formatting, while RTM does not.
