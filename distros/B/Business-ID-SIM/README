DESCRIPTION

    This module can be used to validate Indonesian driving license number,
    Nomor Surat Izin Mengemudi (SIM).

    SIM is composed of 12 digits as follow:

     yymm.pp.aa.ssss

    yy and mm are year and month of birth, pp and aa are area code
    (province+district of some sort), ssss is 4-digit serial most probably
    starting from 1.

    Note that there are several kinds of SIM (A, B1, B2, C) but this is not
    encoded in the SIM number and all SIM's have the same number.
