NAME
    Business::ID::SIM - Validate Indonesian driving license number (nomor
    SIM)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.081 of Business::ID::SIM (from Perl
    distribution Business-ID-SIM), released on 2024-07-11.

SYNOPSIS
     use Business::ID::SIM qw(parse_sim);

     my $res = parse_sim(sim => "0113 40 00 0001");

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to validate Indonesian driving license number,
    Nomor Surat Izin Mengemudi (SIM).

    SIM is composed of 12 digits as follow:

     yymm.pp.aa.ssss

    yy and mm are year and month of birth, pp and aa are area code
    (province+district of some sort), ssss is 4-digit serial most probably
    starting from 1.

    Note that there are several kinds of SIM (A, B1, B2, C) but this is not
    encoded in the SIM number and all SIM's have the same number.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_sim
    Usage:

     parse_sim(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Validate Indonesian driving license number (nomor SIM).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   sim* => *str*

        Input to be parsed.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
