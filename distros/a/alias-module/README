NAME
    alias::module - Alias one module as another

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of alias::module (from Perl
    distribution alias-module), released on 2023-09-30.

SYNOPSIS
     package Your::Alias::Name;
     use alias::module 'Some::Real::Module::Name';

    To avoid require()-ing:

     use alias::module '-norequire', 'Some::Real::Module::Name';

DESCRIPTION
    This module aliases one module name to another.

     package Your::Alias::Name;
     use alias::module 'Some::Real::Module::Name';

    is equivalent to:

     package Your::Alias::Name;
     BEGIN {
         $Package::Alias::BRAVE = 1;
         require Some::Real::Module::Name;
     }
     use Package::Alias 'Your::Alias::Name' => 'Some::Real::Module::Name';

    except that this module does not use Package::Alias and is simpler. It
    is useful if you want to let users access a module's functionality under
    a different (usually shorter) name.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
