SYNOPSIS

      #!/usr/bin/perl
    
      use strict;
      use anywhere qw/ feature say /;
      use Greet;
    
      Greet::hello();
    
      # in Greet.pm
      package Greet;
      use strict;
      sub hello {
        say "Helloooooo!!!!";
      }

DESCRIPTION

    anywhere is a fork of everywhere 0.07 while waiting my proposed change
    to be merged (if ever). It currently only has one difference compared
    to everywhere: it sets %INC entry to the file path instead of letting
    Perl set it to CODE(0x...) so other modules see the used module more
    normally and anywhere can work with things like true.

    The rest is from everywhere documentation:

    I got tired of putting "use 5.010" at the top of every module. So now I
    can throw this in my toplevel program and not have to Repeat Myself
    elsewhere.

    In theory you should be able to pass it whatever you pass to use.

    Also, I just made it so you can do:

      use anywhere 'MooseX::Declare',
        matching => '^MyApp',
        use_here => 0;

    for example and then it will only apply this module to things matching
    your regex. And not use it here. You can also throw in 'package_level
    => 1' to use your package after every "package ..." line. All these are
    experimental :)

EVERYWHERE'S BUGS

    Currently you can only use this once.
