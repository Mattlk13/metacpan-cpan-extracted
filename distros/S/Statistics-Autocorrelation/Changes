Revision history for perl module Statistics-Autocorrelation

0.06 2013-12-15
    - added methods autocovariance(), correlogram()
    - made class object descendant of (ISA) Statistics::Data to make available all its load(), save(), etc. methods here
    - added handling lag => 0, which is now the default lag (no longer lag => 1)
    - added handling of negatively signed lags
    - corrected some circularized lagging issues; prior results only accurate if lag => 1, if at all, not implemented if exact => 1
    - removed "efficient" option in coefficient() - see the new option "unbias" that defines this better (for now)
    - revised misc. other aspects of methods for calculating exact coefficients - more issues to be reviewed
    - added expanded checks for non-zero variance before division
    - added NIST-published example for testing of default (non-circularized and approximate) values returned from coefficient()
    - added some function transcripts into POD manual, among misc manual revisions
    - versions 0.03 to now had the same changes as above but with dist issues for cpan.

	- argument "simple" renamed "efficient" - a deprecation warning printed if used
	- Statistics::Lite as prereq
    - added "coeff" alias
	- POD cleanup
