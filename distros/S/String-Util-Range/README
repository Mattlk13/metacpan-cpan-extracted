NAME
    String::Util::Range - Find sequences in arrays & convert to range (e.g.
    "a","b","c","d","x",1,2,3,4,"x" -> "a..d","x","1..4","x")

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of String::Util::Range (from Perl
    distribution String-Util-Range), released on 2019-01-25.

FUNCTIONS
  convert_sequence_to_range
    Usage:

     convert_sequence_to_range(%args) -> any

    Find sequences in arrays & convert to range (e.g.
    "a","b","c","d","x",1,2,3,4,"x" -> "a..d","x","1..4","x").

    Examples:

    *   basic:

         convert_sequence_to_range(array => [1 .. 4, "x", "a" .. "d"]); # -> ["1..4", "x", "a..d"]

    *   option: separator:

         convert_sequence_to_range(array => [1 .. 4, "x", "a" .. "d"], separator => "-"); # -> ["1-4", "x", "a-d"]

    *   option: threshold:

         convert_sequence_to_range(array => [1 .. 4, "x", "a" .. "e"], threshold => 5); # -> [1 .. 4, "x", "a..e"]

    Sequence follows Perl's autoincrement notion, e.g. 1->2, "aa"->"ab",
    "az"->"ba", "01"->"02", "ab1"->"ab2".

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   array => *array[str]*

    *   separator => *str* (default: "..")

    *   threshold => *posint* (default: 4)

    Return value: (any)

SEE ALSO
    Data::Dump also does something similar, e.g. if you say "dd
    [1,2,3,4,"x","a","b","c","d"];" it will dump the array as ""[1 .. 4,
    "x", "a" .. "d"]"".

    Number::Util::Range which only deals with numbers.
