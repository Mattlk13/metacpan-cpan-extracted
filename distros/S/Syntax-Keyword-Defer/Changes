Revision history for Syntax-Keyword-Defer

0.08    2022-12-15
        [CHANGES]
         * Permit safe forms of `goto` entirely within the defer block
         * Attempt to fix the double-exception problem (RT144761) by turning
           subsequent exceptions into warnings
         * Removed the `FINALLY` support entirely; the module now just croaks
           immediately.

        [CHANGES]
         * Renamed distribution from Syntax-Keyword-Finally

           to it
         * Require at least perl 5.22 on MSWin32 because older perls there
           can't see block_start()/block_end()

Formerly Syntax-Keyword-Finally

0.03    2021-03-03
        [CHANGES]
         * Add Syntax::Keyword::Defer for `defer` syntax alias
         * Document and test that caller() inside FINALLY does not see the
           finally block at all
         * Forbid `return` out of a FINALLY block
         * Forbid the use of `goto` or `next/last/redo` in a FINALLY block at
           all
         * Detect the use of nonlocal flow control out of a FINALLY block and
           at least turn the otherwise-segfault into a panic message
         * Added cross-module integration tests to check the behaviour with
           Syntax::Keyword::Try and perl 5.33.7's feature 'try'

0.02    2021-02-03
        [CHANGES]
