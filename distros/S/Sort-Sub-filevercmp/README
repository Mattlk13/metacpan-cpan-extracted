NAME
    Sort::Sub::filevercmp - Sort using filevercmp

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Sort::Sub::filevercmp (from
    Perl distribution Sort-Sub-filevercmp), released on 2019-05-18.

SYNOPSIS
    Generate sorter (accessed as variable) via Sort::Sub import:

     use Sort::Sub '$filevercmp'; # use '$filevercmp<i>' for case-insensitive sorting, '$filevercmp<r>' for reverse sorting
     my @sorted = sort $filevercmp ('item', ...);

    Generate sorter (accessed as subroutine):

     use Sort::Sub 'filevercmp<ir>';
     my @sorted = sort {filevercmp} ('item', ...);

    Generate directly without Sort::Sub:

     use Sort::Sub::filevercmp;
     my $sorter = Sort::Sub::filevercmp::gen_sorter(
         ci => 1,      # default 0, set 1 to sort case-insensitively
         reverse => 1, # default 0, set 1 to sort in reverse order
     );
     my @sorted = sort $sorter ('item', ...);

    Use in shell/CLI with sortsub (from App::sortsub):

     % some-cmd | sortsub filevercmp
     % some-cmd | sortsub filevercmp --ignore-case -r
