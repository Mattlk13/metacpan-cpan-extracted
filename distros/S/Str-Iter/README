NAME
    Str::Iter - Generate a coderef iterator to iterate a string one (or
    more) character(s) at a time

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Str::Iter (from Perl
    distribution Str-Iter), released on 2024-11-10.

SYNOPSIS
      use Str::Iter qw(str_iter);

      my $iter = str_iter("abc0123"); # iterate one character at a time
      while (defined(my $char = $iter->())) { ... } # a, b, c, 0, 1, 2, 3

      my $iter = str_iter("abc0123", 2); # iterate two characters at a time
      while (defined(my $substr = $iter->())) { ... } # ab, c0, 12, 3

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple iterator which is a coderef that you can
    call repeatedly to get characters from a string. When the characters are
    exhausted, the coderef will return undef. No class/object involved.

FUNCTIONS
  str_iter
    Usage:

     ($str [ , $num_chars=1 ]) => coderef

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
