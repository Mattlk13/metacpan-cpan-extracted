NAME
    SDR::Radio::RTLSDR - Control RTL software defined radio devices

SYNOPSIS
        my $radio = SDR::Radio::RTLSDR->new;

        $radio->frequency(104_500_000);
        $radio->sample_rate(1_000_000);

        $radio->rx(sub {

DESCRIPTION
    This is the SDR driver for RTL-SDR
    <http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr> devices.

    Although you can use it by itself, see the SDR docs for more generic
    usage.

    In order to install this module you will need "librtlsdr" installed. On
    Ubuntu/Debian you can run:

        sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev

    NOTE: This module creates background threads so you should not fork
    after creating "SDR::Radio::RTLSDR" objects.
