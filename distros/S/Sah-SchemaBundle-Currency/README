    (from Perl distribution Sah-SchemaBundle-Currency), released on
    2024-06-26.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   currency::code

        Currency code.

        Accept only current (not retired) codes. Code will be converted to
        uppercase.

        Fiat currency pair, e.g. USD/IDR.

        Currency pair is string in the form of *currency1*/*currency2*,
        where *currency1* is called the base currency while *currency2* is
        the quote (or price) currency. Both must be known currency codes
        (e.g. USD, or IDR).

        Currency code is checked against Locale::Codes::Currency_Codes.

        Will be normalized to uppercase.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
