NAME
    "Syntax::Operator::Matches" - match::simple but as a real infix operator

SYNOPSIS
    On Perl v5.38 or later:

       use v5.38;
       use Syntax::Operator::Matches;

       if ( $x matches $y ) {
          ...;
       }

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a "matches" infix operator using match::simple.

    There's also a "mismatches" operator which returns the inverse. This
    needs to be requested explicitly.

       use v5.38;
       use Syntax::Operator::Matches qw( matches mismatches );
   
       unless ( $x mismatches $y ) {
          ...;
       }

  What matches what?
    As a reminder of what match::simple's matching rules are:

    *   If the right hand side is "undef", then there is only a match if the
        left hand side is also "undef".

    *   If the right hand side is a non-reference, then the match is a
        simple string match.

    *   If the right hand side is a reference to a regexp, then the left
        hand is evaluated.

    *   If the right hand side is a code reference, then it is called in a
        boolean context with the left hand side being passed as an argument.

    *   If the right hand side is an object which provides a "MATCH" method,
        then it this is called as a method, with the left hand side being
        passed as an argument.

    *   If the right hand side is an object which overloads "~~", then this
        will be used.

    *   If the right hand side is an arrayref, then the operator recurses
        into the array, with the match succeeding if the left hand side
        matches any array element.

    *   If any other value appears on the right hand side, the operator will
        croak.

  Use with Type::Tiny
    Type::Tiny type constraints overload the "~~" operator, so the following
    will work:

      use Types::Standard qw( Str ArrayRef );
      use Syntax::Operator::Matches;
  
      if ( $x matches Str ) {
        say $x;
      }
      elsif ( $x matches ArrayRef[Str] ) {
        say $_ for $x->@*;
      }
      else {
        warn "Unexpected input";
      }
