  - If the right-hand side of the `matches` operator is a non-reference,
    short-circuit match::simple and directly check definedness and string
    equality.
  - If the right-hand side of the `matches` operator is a Type::Tiny object,
    short-circuit match::simple and directly use the Type::Tiny API.
  - Both these changes are merely optimizations and shouldn't affect the
    result of the operator.
