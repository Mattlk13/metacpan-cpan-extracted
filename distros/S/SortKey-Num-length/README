NAME
    SortKey::Num::length - String length as sort key

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of SortKey::Num::length (from Perl
    distribution SortKey-Num-length), released on 2024-05-15.

SYNOPSIS
     use Sort::Key qw(nkeysort);
     use SortKey::Num::length;

     my $by_length = SortKey::Num::length::gen_keygen;
     my @sorted = &nkeysort($by_length, "food", "foolish", "foo");

DESCRIPTION
    This is just a demonstration module for SortKey. You might just as well
    use Perl's builtin length() directly:

     nkeysort { length shift } ...

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
