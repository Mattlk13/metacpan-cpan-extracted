Revision history for Mojolicious application Slovo

2018.06.09
    - Changes
        * On failed login the guest user is loaded to have always a user.
        * We `use 5.020` in Slovo.pm to switch ON all Perl features available
          up to this version.
        * Loading of Model classes is postponed untill first use of the
          corresponding helper.
    -Features
        * Added attribute `domain` to Slovo::Controller.
        * Now UTF-8 characters are readable in dumped structures by $c->debug.
        * Added multidomain support. Many domains can be served by one Slovo
          applcation. Domains can be matched also by IPs from which they are
          served. For example 'http://127.0.0.1/alias.стр.html' finds the page
          'alias' in domain localhost.
        * When a page cannot be found a "Not Found" page is displayed.
        * When a page is displayed the `permissions` and `published` matter.
          Secondary groups of a user are supported. In preview mode
          (?прегледъ=1) published, hidden, deleted, start and stop are
          disregarded.
