2018.07.16
    - Changes

2018.06.25
    - Features
        * Implemented a site layout, based on a MUI CSS example. We are getting
          closer to a MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
    - Changes
        * Avoided using varaiables and subroutine names written in azbouka due
          to a missing feature in PPI which causes Perl::Critic to falsely
          complain. See https://github.com/adamkennedy/PPI/issues/226

2018.06.22
    - Changes
        * User Guest is always loaded to have some default permissions for
          every not logged in user.
        * Replaced helper "is_user_authenticated" from
          Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication. Now it checks if the current
          user is not Guest and returns true, false otherwise.
        * Now the user is really authenticated.
        * Removed unused methid "check" from Slovo::Controller::Auth.
        * Improved documentation.
    - Features
        * Better and working "Sign in" without transmitting plain text password.


2018.06.06
    - Changes
        * On failed login the guest user is loaded to have always a user.
        * We `use 5.020` in Slovo.pm to switch ON all Perl features available
          up to this version.
        * Loading of Model classes is postponed untill first use of the
          corresponding helper.
    -Features
        * Added attribute `domain` to Slovo::Controller.
        * Now UTF-8 characters are readable in dumped structures by $c->debug.
        * Added multidomain support. Many domains can be served by one Slovo
          applcation. Domains can be matched also by IPs from which they are
          served. For example 'http://127.0.0.1/alias.стр.html' finds the page
          'alias' in domain localhost.
        * When a page cannot be found a "Not Found" page is displayed.
        * When a page is displayed the `permissions` and `published` matter.
          Secondary groups of a user are supported. In preview mode
          (?прегледъ=1) published, hidden, deleted, start and stop are
          disregarded.
