Revision history for Mojolicious application Slovo

2018.04.15
        Unstable: WIP!
        - Changes
            * Improved documentation.
            * Switched $CODENAME to U+2C0C GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER DJERVI (Ⰼ)
        - Features
            * Implemented Slovo::Plugin::MojoDBx. Not using sqlite.conf
            anymore. This plugin can be moved to Mojolicious namespace.
            There is nothing specific to Slovo in it.
            * WIP - Added tables 'domove', 'stranici' and 'celini'. Beginning
            of a site.
            * Generated MVC and OpenAPI from the tables using
            Mojolicious::Command::generate::resources.
        - Bugs

    - Switched $CODENAME to U+2C0B GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER I (Ⰻ)
    - Improved documentation.
    - Added first migration file. Table definitions and initial data are taken
      from Ado.
    - Used Mojolicious::Command::generate::resources to generate code for
      groups and users resources like this:
      $ generate resources -D dbx -t "groups,users" -T \
      lib/Slovo/resources/templates --api_dir lib/Slovo/resources
    - Added sqlite.conf which can be switched with pg.conf or mysql.conf.
      This way the database can be easily switched by adding specific
      adapter configuration files.
    - Added helper 'dbx' which will be instance of Mojo::SQLite, Mojo::Pg or
      Mojo::mysql instead of corresponding 'sqlite', 'pg', or 'mysql'.
    - Added Slovo::Cotroller.
    - Improved a bit the generated code for models. Added parent class
      Slovo::Model.

    - Added Test::Mojo::Role::Slovo.
