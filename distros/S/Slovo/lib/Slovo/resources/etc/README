In this folder we keep configuration files.

You may want to create environment specific versions of slovo.conf named after
the environment e.g. slovo.development.conf or slovo.production.conf. The
environment specific files will be detected and used. These files may be
changed locally for experimenting but local changes usualy do not have to go
upstream. To ignore such files but keep them versioned one have to run the
command "git update-index". Here is an example with slovo.conf.

  git update-index --assume-unchanged etc/slovo.development.conf

To make git track the file again, when you have a change that you want to push
upstream, simply run:

  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged etc/slovo.development.conf.
