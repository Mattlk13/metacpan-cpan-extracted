NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Examples - Various example Sah schemas

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of Sah::Schemas::Examples (from
    Perl distribution Sah-Schemas-Examples), released on 2021-07-30.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   array_of_int

        Array of integers.

    *   array_of_posint

        Array of positive integers.

    *   example::foo

        A sample schema.

        This is just a simple schema based on "str" with no additional
        restriction clauses.

    *   example::has_merge

        Even integer.

        This schema is based on "posint", which is ["int", {min=>1}], and
        adds another clause div_by=>2. However, this schema also deletes the
        min=>1 clause using merge key: merge.delete.min=>undef. Thus, the
        resolved result becomes ["int", {div_by=>2}] which is basically
        "even integer". Without the merge key, this schema would become
        "positive even integer."

    *   example::recurse1

        Recursive schema.

        This schema will cause the resolver Data::Sah::Resolve to bail
        because it recurses to itself.

    *   example::recurse2a

        Recursive schema.

    *   example::recurse2b

        Recursive schema.

        This schema will cause the resolver Data::Sah::Resolve to bail
        because it eventually recurses to itself.

    *   hash_of_int

        Hash of integers.

    *   hash_of_posint

        Hash of positive integers.

    *   ints

        Array of integers.

    *   posints

        Array of positive integers.
