    Proof of concept. Incomplete catalog.

DESCRIPTION

    This module contains catalog of software.

    Currently the main use for this module is to establish a common name
    for a software and find the Debian source package name(s) (and possibly
    others too in the future, like Fedora package, FreeBSD port, etc) for
    it.

    Eventually, if the project takes off, this will also contain
    summary/description/URL/license for each software.
