    >> str = 'abcde'; text = 'abcdefg'
    'abcde'

    > cat rule.spp
    door    = ^ declare Expr+ $;
    declare = (set @type ['int']);
    Expr    = 'type' \s Mytype (push @type $Mytype) \s Type \s*;
    Mytype  = \w+ ;
    Type    = @type;

    > cat text.txt
    type rune int
    type str rune

    > spp rule.spp
    Lint rule.spp ok!

    > spp rule.spp text.txt
    [["Expr",[["Mytype","rune"],["Type","int"]]],
     ["Expr",[["Mytype","str"],["Type","rune"]]]]

DESCRIPTION

## branch

if have more than one rule could match the text, then use branch.

    | branch-one branch-two branch-three |

branch would return first rule which matched.

## longest branch

longest branch would return longest-matching-string rule.

    || branch-one branch-two branch-three ||

if more than one branch matched, then return longest matching rule.

## Token

Token is name defined with Spp specification.

    Token = 'define more rule';

Token could include itself, if its have different border. just like:

    array = '[' |int str array|+ ']'

## Token naming

if name starts with uppercase, then it is Name Token:

    >> Upper = \u+; text = 'ABCDe'
    ['Upper', 'ABCD']

if name starts with lowercase, then it would not naming:

    >> Lower = \l+ ; text = 'abcdEF'
    ["Lower","abcd"]

if name starts with \_, then match would be reject after match.

    comment = '#' ~ $$; // return true or false

## Not

if some rule not permit follow other rule:

    space = rule ! { \n [^\s] };

Some language (EBNF) define end, if next line starts with blank then is not end.

    spec  = branch-one | branch-two | branch-three
    new_spec  =  'this is spec'
      
## Char Class

   \a  alpha  a..z A..Z 'a' 'b' 'A'
   \d  digit  0..9
   \h  hspace
   \l  lowercase a..z
   \s  space or enter
   \u  uppercase A..Z
   \v  vspace
   \w  words  [\a_-]
   \x  xdigit 0..9 a..f A..F

## Chars Class

   [\sab]
   [^ab]

## string

   str = :abcd
   str = 'abcd'

## Char

   char = \n \r \f \t \" \' \\ \; ;

## Comment

   // this is comment
   comment = '//' ~ $$ ;

## branch
    >>  rule = |:abc :abcd|; text = :abcd
    ["abc"]

    >> rule = ||:abc :abcd||; text = :abcd
    ["abcd"]
