Stat::lsMode

"Stat::lsMode" generates mode and permission strings that look like the
ones generated by the Unix "ls -l" command. For example, a regular file
that is readable by everyone and writable only by its owner has the mode
string "-rw-r--r--". "Stat::lsMode" will either examine the file and
produce the right mode string for you, or you can pass it the mode that
you get back from Perl's "stat" call.
