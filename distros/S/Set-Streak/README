NAME
    Set::Streak - Routines related to streaks (longest item appearance in
    consecutive sets)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Set::Streak (from Perl
    distribution Set-Streak), released on 2023-12-09.

FUNCTIONS
  gen_longest_streaks_table
    Usage:

     gen_longest_streaks_table(%args) -> any

    Generate ranking table of longest streaks.

    This routine can be used to generate a ranking table of longest streaks,
    represented by sets. You supply a list (arrayref) of "sets", each set
    representing a period. The routine will rank the items that appear the
    longest in consecutive sets (periods).

    For example, let's generate a table for longest daily CPAN releases for
    November 2023 up until today (assume today is the Nov 5th), the input
    will be:

     [
       [qw/PERLANCAR DART JJATRIA NERDVANA LEEJO CUKEBOT RSCHUPP JOYREX TANIGUCHI OODLER OLIVER JV/],     # period 1 (first): list of CPAN authors releasing something on Nov 1, 2023
       [qw/SKIM PERLANCAR BURAK BDFOY SUKRIA AJNN YANGAK CCELSO SREZIC/],                                 # period 2: list of CPAN authors releasing something on Nov 2, 2023
       [qw/JGNI DTUCKWELL SREZIC WOUTER LSKATZ SVW RAWLEYFOW DJERIUS PERLANCAR CRORAA EINHVERFR ASPOSE/], # period 3: list of CPAN authors releasing something on Nov 3, 2023
       [qw/JGNI LEONT LANCEW NKH MDOOTSON SREZIC PERLANCAR DROLSKY JOYREX JRM DAMI PRBRENAN DCHURCH/],    # period 4: list of CPAN authors releasing something on Nov 4, 2023
       [qw/JGNI JRM TEAM LICHTKIND JJATRIA JDEGUEST PERLANCAR SVW DRCLAW PLAIN SUKRIA RSCHUPP/],          # period 5 (current): list of CPAN authors releasing something on Nov 5, 2023
     ]

    The result of the routine will be like:

     [
       { item => "PERLANCAR", len => 5, start => 1, status => "ongoing" },
       { item => "SREZIC", len => 3, start => 2, status => "might-break" },
       { item => "JGNI", len => 3, start => 3, status => "ongoing" },
       { item => "JRM", len => 2, start => 4, status => "ongoing" },
       { item => "CUKEBOT", len => 1, start => 1, status => "broken" },
       { item => "DART", len => 1, start => 1, status => "broken" },
       { item => "JJATRIA", len => 1, start => 1, status => "broken" },
       ...
     ]

    Sorting is done by "len" (descending) first, then by "start"
    (ascending), then by "item" (ascending).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_broken => *bool*

        Whether to exclude broken streaks.

        Streak status is either: "ongoing" (item still appear in current
        period), "might-break" (does not yet appear in current period, but
        current period is assumed to have not ended yet, later update might
        still see item appearing), or "broken" (no longer appear after its
        beginning period sometime in the past periods).

        If you set this option to true, streaks that have the status of
        "broken" are not returned.

    *   min_len => *posint*

        Minimum length of streak to return.

    *   raw => *true*

        Instead of streaks table, return the raw streaks hash.

    *   sets* => *aoaos*

        (No description)

    *   start_period => *posint*

        (No description)

    *   streaks => *hash*

        Initialize streaks hash with this.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
