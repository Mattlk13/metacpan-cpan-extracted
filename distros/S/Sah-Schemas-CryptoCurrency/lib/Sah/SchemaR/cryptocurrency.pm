=head1 NAME

Sah::SchemaR::cryptocurrency - Cryptocurrency code, name, or safename

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.015 of Sah::SchemaR::cryptocurrency (from Perl distribution Sah-Schemas-CryptoCurrency), released on 2020-03-08.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is automatically generated by Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas during distribution build.

A Sah::SchemaR::* module is useful if a client wants to quickly lookup the base type of a schema without having to do any extra resolving. With Sah::Schema::*, one might need to do several lookups if a schema is based on another schema, and so on. Compare for example L<Sah::Schema::poseven> vs L<Sah::SchemaR::poseven>, where in Sah::SchemaR::poseven one can immediately get that the base type is C<int>. Currently L<Perinci::Sub::Complete> uses Sah::SchemaR::* instead of Sah::Schema::* for reduced startup overhead when doing tab completion.
