NAME
    Swagger2 - Deprecated

VERSION
    0.89

DEPRECATION WARNING
    The Swagger2 distribution is no longer actively maintained. Only severe
    bug fixes and pull requests will move this code forward. The reason
    behind this is that the code is too complex and hard to maintain.

    So what should you use instead?

    * Swagger2

      Swagger2 is either not very useful or replaced by JSON::Validator.

    * Swagger2::Client

      No alternatives. The issue with this module is that it does not
      understand if you have parameters with the same name. There might be a
      OpenAPI::Client at some point, but it is currently no plans to write
      it.

    * Swagger2::Editor

      No alternatives.

    * Swagger2::POD

      Swagger2::POD is not very good and also very hard to maintain.
      Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI has a HTML renderer which makes
      documentation that is much easier to read and always in sync with the
      application.

      When that is said: The renderer in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI need
      refinement.

    * Swagger2::SchemaValidator

      Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI has the validator built in. For other
      purposes, use JSON::Validator or JSON::Validator::OpenAPI instead.

    * Mojolicious::Command::swagger2

      No alternatives.

    * Mojolicious::Plugin::Swagger2

      Use Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI instead. Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI
      plays much nicer together with the Mojolicious framework.
