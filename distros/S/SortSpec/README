    Basic use with Sort::BySpec:

DESCRIPTION
    EXPERIMENTAL.

    "SortSpec" is a namespace for modules that declare sort specifications.
    Sort specifications are used with Sort::BySpec.

  Writing a SortSpec module
     package SortSpec::Foo;

     # required. must return a hash (DefHash)
     sub meta {
         return +{
             v => 1,
             summary => 'Sort specification related to Foo',
             args => {
                 arg1 => {
                     schema => 'str*', # Sah schema
                     req => 1,
                 },
             },
         };
     }

     sub get_spec {
         my %args = @_;
         ...
         return [...];
     }

     1;

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
