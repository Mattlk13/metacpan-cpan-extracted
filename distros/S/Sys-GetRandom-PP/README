NAME

    Sys::GetRandom::PP - pure Perl interface to getrandom(2)

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Perl versions of the syscall.h and sys/random.h headers (as generated by
    the h2ph tool) must be available. If you are using perl from a system
    package, this should have already been done for you. If you have built
    your own perl (and you have write permissions on its module
    directories), you may have to run this command first:

        cd /usr/include && h2ph -eal syscall.h sys/random.h

    Apparent errors about missing internal headers such as "Can't open
    gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory" can be ignored.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

    After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
    perldoc command.

        perldoc Sys::GetRandom::PP
