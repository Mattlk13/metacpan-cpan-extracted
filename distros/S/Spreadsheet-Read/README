=head1 NAME

Spreadsheet::Read - Meta-Wrapper for reading spreadsheet data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Spreadsheet::Read;
  my $ref = ReadData ("file.xls");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Spreadsheet::Read offers a uniformed wrapper to Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
and Spreadheet::ReadSXC to give the end-user a single point of view to
various types of spreadsheets and deal with these in a transparent way.

For more thorough documentation please refer to the perl documentation
in the module in pod format, or

  $ man Spreadsheet::Read

after installation.

=head1 INSTALLATION

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

If the C<make test> warns you in the xls tests, read the message and
apply the generated patch. Spreadsheet::ParseExcel has a small bug in
the parsing of the default format regarding UTF-8.

This module requires perl-5.8.1 or newer. It might still work under
perl-5.8.0 or perl-5.6.x, but only if Encode is also available. The
code might need some minor changes.
