NAME
    Shorthand - Shorthand

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Shorthand (from Perl
    distribution Shorthand), released on 2019-02-10.

DESCRIPTION
    Shorthand is namespace reserved for modules that perform a shorthand for
    something. For example:

     use Shorthand::Entropy::UseLocal;

    is a shorthand for:

     use Data::Entropy;
     use Data::Entropy::Source;
     use Data::Entropy::RawSource::Local;

     $Data::Entropy::entropy_source = Data::Entropy::Source->new(
         Data::Entropy::RawSource::Local->new, "sysread");

FAQ
  Why not pragma?
    Naming your module as a pragma might indicate that the effect of your
    module can be scoped lexically.
