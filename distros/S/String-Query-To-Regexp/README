    String::Query::To::Regexp - Convert query to regular expression

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of String::Query::To::Regexp (from
    Perl distribution String-Query-To-Regexp), released on 2022-11-02.

SYNOPSIS
     use String::Query::To::Regexp qw(query2re);

     my $re;

     $re = query2re("foo");                       # => qr/\A(?=.*foo).*\z/s   -> string must contain 'foo'
     $re = query2re({ci=>1}, "foo";               # => qr/\A(?=.*foo).*\z/is  -> string must contain 'foo', case-insensitively
     $re = query2re("foo", "bar");                # => qr/\A(?=.*foo)(?=.*bar).*\z/s   -> string must contain 'foo' and 'bar', order does not matter
     $re = query2re("foo", "-bar");               # => qr/\A(?=.*foo)(?!.*bar).*\z/s   -> string must contain 'foo' but must not contain 'bar'
     $re = query2re({bool=>"or"}, "foo", "bar");  # => qr/\A(?:(?=.*foo)|(?!.*bar)).*\z/s  -> string must contain 'foo' or 'bar'
     $re = query2re({word=>1}, "foo", "bar");     # => qr/\A(?=.*\bfoo\b)(?!.*\bbar\b).*\z/s  -> string must contain words 'foo' and 'bar'; 'food' or 'lumbar' won't match

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides "query2re" function to convert one or more string
    queries to a regular expression. Features of the queries:

    *   Negative searching using the *-FOO* syntax

FUNCTIONS
  query2re
    Usage:

     my $re = query2re([ \%opts , ] @query);

    Create a regular expression object from query @query.

    Known options:

    *   bool

        Str. Default "and". Either "and" or "or".

    *   word

        Bool. Default false. If set to true, queries must be separate words.

    *   ci

        Bool. Default false. If set to true, will do case-insensitive
        matching

    *   re

        Bool. Default false. If set to true, will allow regexes in @query as
        well as converting string queries of the form "/foo/" to regex using
        Regexp::From::String.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
