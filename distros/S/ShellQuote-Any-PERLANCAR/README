VERSION

    (from Perl distribution ShellQuote-Any-PERLANCAR), released on

SYNOPSIS
     use ShellQuote::Any; # exports shell_quote()

     shell_quote('curl', 'http://example.com/?foo=123&bar=baz');
     # curl 'http://example.com/?foo=123&bar=baz'

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is currently For testing only.

FUNCTIONS
  shell_quote(@cmd) => str
    Quote command @cmd according to OS. On Windows, will use
    Win32::ShellQuote's "quote_system_string()". Otherwise, will use
    String::ShellQuote's "shell_quote()". Exported by default.

    If you want to simulate how quoting is done under another OS, you could
    do something like:

     {
         local $^O = "Win32"; # simulate Windows
         say shell_quote("foo bar");
     }
