=head1 NAME

Perinci::Sub::XCompletion::unix_user_or_uid - Generate completion for Unix user/UID

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.022 of Perinci::Sub::XCompletion::unix_user_or_uid (from Perl distribution Sah-SchemaBundle-Unix), released on 2024-11-15.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This creates a completion from list of local Unix usernames and UIDs.

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 gen_completion

Usage:

 gen_completion() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

This function is not exported.

No arguments.

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or something like "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is the actual result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional metadata.

Return value:  (any)

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Sah-SchemaBundle-Unix>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
