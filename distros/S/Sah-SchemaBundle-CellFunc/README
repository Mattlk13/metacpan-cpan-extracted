NAME
    Sah::SchemaBundle::CellFunc - Sah schemas related to CellFunc

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Sah::SchemaBundle::CellFunc
    (from Perl distribution Sah-SchemaBundle-CellFunc), released on
    2024-12-10.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   perl::cellfunc::modname

        Perl CellFunc::* module name without the prefix, e.g. File/stat_row.

        Contains coercion rule so you can also input "Foo-Bar", "Foo/Bar",
        "Foo/Bar.pm" or even 'Foo.Bar' and it will be normalized into
        "Foo::Bar".

    *   perl::cellfunc::modname_with_optional_args

        Perl CellFunc::* module name without the prefix (e.g.
        File::stat_row) with optional arguments (e.g.
        File::stat_row,follow_symlink,1).

        Perl CellFunc::* module name without the prefix, with optional
        arguments which will be used as import arguments, just like the
        "-MMODULE=ARGS" shortcut that "perl" provides. Examples:

         File::stat_row
         File::stat_row,follow_symlink,0
         File::stat_row=follow_symlink,0

        See also: "perl::cellfunc::modname".

    *   perl::cellfunc::modnames

        Array of Perl CellFunc::* module names without the prefix, e.g.
        ["File::stat_row", "File::Media::attr_row"].

        Array of Perl CellFunc::* module names, where each element is of
        "perl::cellfunc::modname" schema, e.g. "File::stat_row",
        "File::Media::attr_row".

        Contains coercion rule that expands wildcard, so you can specify:

         File::*

        and it will be expanded to e.g.:

         ["File::stat_row", "File::exists"]

        The wildcard syntax supports jokers ("?", "*", "**"), brackets
        ("[abc]"), and braces ("{one,two}"). See Module::List::Wildcard for
        more details.

    *   perl::cellfunc::modnames_with_optional_args

        Array of Perl CellFunc::* module names without the prefix, with
        optional args, e.g. ["File::stat_row,follow_symlink,0",
        "File::Media::attr_row"].

        Array of Perl CellFunc::* module names without the prefix and with
        optional args. Each element is of "perl::cellfunc::modname" schema,
        e.g. "File::stat_row", "File::Media::attr_row".

        Contains coercion rule that expands wildcard, so you can specify:

         File::*

        and it will be expanded to e.g.:

         ["File::attr_row", "File::exists"]

        The wildcard syntax supports jokers ("?", "*", "**"), brackets
        ("[abc]"), and braces ("{one,two}"). See Module::List::Wildcard for
        more details.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
