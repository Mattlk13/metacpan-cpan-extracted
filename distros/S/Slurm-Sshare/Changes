Revision history for Slurm-Sshare

1.2.2	2016-Mar-08
	Really fix bug 112721
1.2.1	2016-Mar-07
	sbalance output now deterministic even with hash order randomization
	(accounts listed alphabetically).  This is mainly to fix regression
	test failures on newer perls.
	Also fixed bug 112721 (test of sbalance relying on perl in shebang of
	script, not perl used for build).  Thanks to SREZIC for catching.
1.2.0	2016-Feb-24
	Add compatibility for Slurm 15.08.2 (Trackable Resources)
	Still somewhat basic, and sshare cmd does not expose usage_tres_raw
	yet.  That is what sbalance really needs to look at!
	Add ability to specify sshare capabilities/version when setting sshare path.
	Add partition, grptresmins, and tresrunmins data fields
	Add nopartinfo argument to sshare_list, sshare_list will now request partition
		information by default if sshare supports it.
	Add slurm_usage* methods, etc.
	Deprecated usage_for_account_in_cluster method
	Fixed documentation for sbalance command, and changed "Available"
	to "Unused" (want to reserve "Available" for "Unused" less CPURunMins)

1.1.0	2016-Feb-09
	Added sbalance utility.
	Also have Makefile.PL complain if not on Unix-like OS

1.0.0   2016-Jan-20
        packaged for CPAN
	Package existed since July 2014, finally cleaning up enough for release
