Slurm::Share is copyright 2014-2016 by the University of Maryland.

Slurm-Sshare version 1.00
=========================

This is a wrapper around the Slurm sshare command.  Basically, it
provides some methods so that one can call the sshare command from with
Perl.  It also provides a couple of higher level methods for returning
the usage of an Slurm account in a Slurm cluster, or for a specific
user in a Slurm account/cluster.

A verbose mode is also supported, which will print out the actual
sshare commands before executing them.  Because the Slurm sshare command
only views information and does not change the databases, there is no 
need for a "dryrun" mode.

This package wraps calls to the Slurm sshare command, and does not directly
talk to any Slurm databases.  This approach has pros and cons, but as the 
Slurm sshare command seems to have a fairly stable interface, the Perl module
should be fairly stable as well.  Linking to Slurm libraries directly might
have some performance benefits, but this did not seem like code that needs to
be highly optimized.  Using the wrapper approach also makes for easier correlation
between manual procedures, thereby easing the automation of routine procedures.

It has been used with Slurm version 2.x to 15.08.2, although not all features
are available on all versions.  Although the package will install and regression
tests may succeed even on systems without Slurm (the tests use canned input),
the package is not useful without Slurm.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The Sshare.pm module defaults to looking for 'sshare' in the PATH of the user
running the code, but you can edit the file if you wish a different default 'sshare'
to be used (set the value of SSHARE_CMD near the top of the Sshare.pm file; there are
comments in the code to guide you).  The caller can always specify a path.

The sbalance script will also be installed by the above. However, it is recommended
that you modify the resulting script (either in the build directory before the make install
or in the destination directory afterwards) to customize it for your site.  More information
is in the bin/README file.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires you to have Slurm installed, and in particular the sshare command,
in order to be of use.  The regression tests use hacked test scripts which mimic sshare output,
and so will succeed even without a Slurm installation, but there is no point to installing this
module without Slurm.

The module has been used/test on Slurm versions from 2.x to 15.08.2, although not all features
are available on all slurm versions.

The module requires the Class::Accessor module from CPAN.

The sbalance script additionally requires Pod::Usage for displaying documentation
