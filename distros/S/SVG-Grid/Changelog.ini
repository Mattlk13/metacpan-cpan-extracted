- Patch t/test.t so that before comparing shipped SVG with generated one, zap within those
2 files the versions #s of the SVG modules which created the files. This is necessary
because I generated data/synopsis.svg with SVG V 2.64, but any version might be
installed on another machine. See #RT212178. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for the report.

Comments= <<EOT
- Patch image_link() to return the auto-generated id of the image element. Likewise,
rectangle_link() returns the id of the rectangle element and text_link() returns the id
of the text element.
- Patch t/test.t to clean up the string name of the test.

- No code changes.
- After I had a fight with github, git updated t/test.t to restore the obsolete name cell.svg
instead of synopsis.svg as the file to be compared to the output of the test, so the test
failed.
