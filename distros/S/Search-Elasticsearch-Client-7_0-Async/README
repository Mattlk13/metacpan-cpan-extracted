    support for Elasticsearch 7.x APIs

VERSION
    version 8.00

DESCRIPTION
    The Search::Elasticsearch::Client::7_0::Async package provides a client
    compatible with Elasticsearch 7.x. It should be used in conjunction with
    Search::Elasticsearch::Async as follows:

        $e = Search::Elasticsearch::Async->new(
            client => "7_0::Direct"
        );

    See Search::Elasticsearch::Client::7_0::Direct for documentation about
    how to use the client itself.

PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ELASTICSEARCH
    This version of the client supports the Elasticsearch 7.0 branch, which
    is not backwards compatible with earlier branches.
