=head1 NAME

scriptx-eg-run-code - Run a code

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.000004 of scriptx-eg-run-code (from Perl distribution ScriptX), released on 2020-10-01.

 % script-eg-run-code

 Please enter your gender (M/F): x
 Wrong response. Please enter your gender (M/F): m
 Hello, Mr. Budi!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script loads the L<ScriptX::Run> plugin to run something. The plugin
accepts a coderef (C<code>) or a string/array for external command (passed to
L<IPC::System::Options>'s C<system()>). Alternatively, it can search for
C<run()> in the C<main> package. In this script, we provide the second option.
