SQL::Concrete

This module converts SQL fragments interleaved with variable references
and some keywords into one regular SQL string along with a list of bind
values, suitable for passing to DBI.

It is an antithesis of sorts to SQL::Abstract: you are expected to write
most of any query as regular SQL. The job of this module is to manage
your placeholders for you rather than hide the SQL, and it can infer
them from data structures you usually already have. Without it, passing
the data from such data structures to DBI manually would mean
laboriously destructuring them into a plain list of bind values, then
carefully ensuring the correspondence of placeholders with the order of
bind values every time you modify the query.

This module does do *some* SQL generation, but it makes no attempt to
invent conventions to express all possible SQL constructs. The aim is
only to make common obvious cases easier to read and write. For anything
beyond that you are expected to fall back to verbatim SQL.

This makes database code easier to read as well as easier to write,
while easily providing ready access to all SQL features, even without
SQL::Concrete having to have specific support for almost any of them.

SQL, unparametrized:
   name LIKE "%son" AND (age >= 10 AND age <= 20)

DBI with placeholders:
   'name LIKE ? AND (age >= ? AND age <= ?)', '%son', 10, 20

SQL::Abstract, trying to express it all:
   { name => { like => '%son' }, age => { '>=', 10, '<=', 20 } }

SQL::Concrete, lacking syntactic shortcuts for this task:
   'name LIKE', \'%son', 'AND (age >=', \10, 'AND', 'age <=', \20, ')'
