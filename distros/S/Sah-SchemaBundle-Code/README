NAME
    Sah::SchemaBundle::Code - Various schemas related to 'code' type and
    coderefs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Sah::SchemaBundle::Code (from
    Perl distribution Sah-SchemaBundle-Code), released on 2024-06-10.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   code_from_str

        Coderef from eval\`ed string.

        This schema accepts coderef or string which will be eval'ed to
        coderef. Note that this means allowing your user to provide
        arbitrary Perl code for you to execute! Make sure first and foremost
        that security-wise this is acceptable in your case.

        By default eval() is performed in the "main" namespace and without
        stricture or warnings. See the parameterized version
        Sah::PSchema::code_from_str if you want to customize the eval().

        What's the difference between this schema and "str_or_code" (from
        Sah::Schemas::Str)? Both this schema and "str_or_code" accept
        string, but this schema will directly compile any input string while
        "str_or_code" will only convert string to code if it is in the form
        of "sub { ... }". In other words, this schema will always produce
        coderef, while "str_or_code" can produce strings also.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
