Sub::QuoteX::Utils

Sub::QuoteX::Utils provides a simplified interface to the process of
combining Sub::Quote compatible code references with new code.

Sub::Quote provides a number of routines to make code more performant by
inlining syntactically complete chunks of code into a single compiled
subroutine.

When a chunk of code is compiled into a subroutine by
"Sub::Quote::quote_sub()", Sub::Quote keeps track of the code and any
captured variables used to construct that subroutine, so that new code
can be added to the original code and the results compiled into a new
subroutine.

Sub::QuoteX::Utils makes that latter process a little easier.

  Captures

Sub::Quote keeps track of captured variables in hashes, *copying* the
values. For example,

 use Sub::Quote;
 
 my $sound = 'woof';
 
 my $emit = quote_sub( q{ print "$sound\n" }, { '$sound' => \$sound } );
 
 &$emit; # woof
 
 $sound = 'meow';
 
 &$emit; # woof

When combining chunks of inlined code, each chunk has it's own set of
captured values which must be kept distinct.

"quote_subs" manages this for the caller, but when using the low level
routines ( "inlinify_coderef", "inlinify_method", "inlinify_code" ) the
caller must manage the captures. These routines store per-chunk captures
in their "\%global_capture" argument. The calling routine optionally may
provide a mnemonic (but unique!) string which will be part of the key
for the chunk.

The %global_capture hash should be passed to "quote_sub" in Sub::Quote,
when the final subroutine is compiled. For example,

  my %global_capture;
  my $code = inlinify_coderef( \%global_capture, $coderef, %options );

  # add more code to $code [...]

  $new_coderef = Sub::Quote::quote_sub( $code, \%global_capture );
