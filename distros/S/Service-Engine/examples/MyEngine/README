MyEngine 

A Service Engine performs two basic functions:

Select itmes to process
Work on the items selected

What is selected is definded in Modules::Selector
The work performed is defined in Modules::Worker

To make a service engine:
    - duplicate this example
    - rename the directory
    - modify config.pl
    - customize Modules::Selector and Modules::Worker
    - start the new engine: ./start-emgine.pl

To connect to the admin console, telnet to the ip and port defined in config.pl

To connect to the REST API, browse to http://yourIP:yourPort/Health/api_overview, 
or other endooints you define in your config file.
