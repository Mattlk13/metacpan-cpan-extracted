	* Fix rt.cpan.org #112964:
	  t/01base.t may fail (-Duselongdouble && hash randomization)

	  The test was expecting floating point equivalence, which in itself
	  is a bad expectation, but what broke it was a bit more interesting:
	  because of long doubles the summation order mattered, and the hash
	  randomization affected the summation order.

	* Fix trailing whitespace in ChangeLog.

	* Fix Statistics::Frequency link in pod.

	* Modernize tests to use strict + warnings.
