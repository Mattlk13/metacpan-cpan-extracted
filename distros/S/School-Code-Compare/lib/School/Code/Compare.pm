=head1 NAME

School::Code::Compare - 'naive' metrics for code similarity

=head1 VERSION

version 0.104

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This distribution ships a script.
You migth want to look at the script L<compare-code> in the C<bin> directory.
For documentation of the used libraries, keep on reading.

This calculates the Levenshtein Difference for two files, if they meet certain criterias:

 use School::Code::Compare;
 
 my $comparer   = School::Code::Compare->new()
                                       ->set_max_relative_difference(2)
                                       ->set_min_char_total        (20)
                                       ->set_max_relative_distance(0.8);
 
 my $comparison = $comparer->measure('use v5.22; say "Hi"!',
                                      'use v5.22; say "Hello";'
                                     );
 print $comparison->{distance} if $comparison

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 set_max_char_difference

Don't even start comparison, if the difference in char count is higher than set.

=head2 set_min_char_total

Don't even start comparison if a file is below this char count.

=head2 set_max_distance

Abort comparison (in the midst of comparison), if distance is becoming higher then set value.

=head2 measure

Do a comparison for two strings.
Gives back a hash reference with different information:

 # (example output from synopsis)
 {
     'comment' => 'comparison done',
     'delta_length' => 3,
     'distance' => 5
     'length1' => 20,
     'length2' => 23,
     'ratio' => 79,
 };

=over 4

=item distance

The Levenshtein Distance.
See L<Text::Levenshtein::XS> for more information.

=item ratio

The ratio of the distance in chars to the average length of the compared strings.
A ratio of zero means, the strings are similar.
A ratio of 50 means, that 50% of a string is different.

My experience is, that if you get a ratio below 30% you have to start looking if the code was copied and altered (if your concern is to find 'cheaters' in educational/school environments).
This method of measurement is by no means well established.
It may be even 'naive', but it just seems to work out quite well.
See L<School::Code::Compare::Judge> to see, how the results are currently interpreted.

=item comment

A comment on how the comparison went.

=item delta_length

Difference in length (chars) of the two compared strings.
