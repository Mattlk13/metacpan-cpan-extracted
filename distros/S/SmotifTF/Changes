        and smotiftf_cluster.pl for cluster support.

0.07    2015-06-25
		* Bug fix in Psiblast.pm (deltablast path and exec)
		* Fixed smotiftf_config.ini to remove hard-coded paths in smotiftf_prereq.pl,
		  GetSMotifsfromPDB.pm and PDBfileParser.pm
		* Fixed the PDB path in PDBfileParser.pm and GeometricalCalculations.pm so that
          it can handle both regular and remodeled_pdb (remodeled PDB has chain id in the 
          file name). 

0.08   2015-08-6
       * In version 0.07, 01.Psipred_run.t is failing in all platform except linux.
         01.Psipred_run.t was modified to find smotiftf_config.ini in /t/Data 
         while running testing routines.
 
         smotiftf_config.ini file has to be found at /t/Data for testing purpose
         $ENV{'SMOTIFTF_CONFIG_FILE'} = File::Spec->catfile("t", "Data", "smotiftf_config.ini");
