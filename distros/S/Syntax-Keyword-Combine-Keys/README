NAME
    Syntax::Keyword::Combine::Keys - ckeys keyword

VERSION
    Version 0.12

SYNOPSIS
            use Syntax::Keyword::Combine::Keys;

            my %hash = ckeys {
                    $_ => $HASH{$_}->{value};
            } %{$hash1}, %hash2, e => { value => 500 };

DESCRIPTION
    This ia an experimental module written for learning purposes. The module
    provides a single keyword - ckeys, most simply put it is a modification
    of map being passed the sorted keys of a hash. To demonstrate further
    the following is the "pure" perl equivalent of the synopsis.

            my %HASH = (%{$hash1}, %hash2, e => { value => 500 };
            my %hash = map {
                    $_ => $HASH{$_}->{value};
            } sort keys %HASH;

KEYWORDS
  ckeys
            my @keys = ckeys {
                    uc $_;
            } %hash1, %hash2, %hash3

    Repeatedly calls the block of code, with $_ locally set to each key from
    the given list. It Returns the processed values from the block. ckeys
    also exposes a variable called %HASH which contains the merged list that
    is passed to the block.

            %HASH = ( %hash1, %hash2, $hash3 );
