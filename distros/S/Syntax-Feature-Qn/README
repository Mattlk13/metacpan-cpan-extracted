NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Qn - Perl syntax extension for line-based quoting

SYNOPSIS
      use qn;

      @foo = qn {
        line one
        line two
        line three
      };
      # ("line one", "line two", "line three")

      $bar = 'BAR';
      @foo = qqn {
        foo
        $bar
        bam
      };
      # ("foo", "BAR", "bam")

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds line-based quoting operators to Perl, similar to
    here-docs, but without the required outdenting.

    The qn() and qqn() operators are drop-in replacements for q() and qq(),
    respectively. The same delimiter rules apply.

    The quote body is split on "\n" and each resulting list item is stripped
    of leading and trailing whitespace. Inner whitespace is preserved.

    Empty lines, or lines consisting of only whitespace, translate to empty
    string list items.

    The first and last items can be on the same line as the delimiter, or
    not. So, these are the same:

      @foo = qn {
        first
        second
        third
        fourth
      };
      # ("first", "second", "third", "fourth")

      @foo = qn { first
        second
        third
        fourth };
      # ("first", "second", "third", "fourth")

    You could even get away with this:

      @foo = qn { first };
      # ("first")
