version 0.003; 2017-07-29

version 0.002; 2017-07-27

  * bugfix: chain correct op checker for index/rindex ops when not

    (which is the default from Perl 5.25.1)

  * be more conservative about maintaining op tree structure

  * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
    necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7

  * register custom ops on Perl 5.13.7+

  * use cleaner wrap_op_checker() API to control op checking

  * elide custom null ops at peep time on Perl 5.19.10+

version 0.001; 2012-02-01

  * bugfix: properly avoid duff constant folding with pos() code on Perl
    5.9.4 and above, which only occurred when warnings were disabled in
    the context of the pos() expression

  * bugfix: also influence rindex, as $[ does

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    compatibility with early-loaded warnings.pm) and invoke it earlier
    to make sure it takes effect in time

  * update documentation for $[ changes in Perl 5.15.3 and 5.15.5

  * in Build.PL, declare incompatibility with pre-0.19
    B::Hooks::OP::Check, which doesn't play nicely around op check hooking
