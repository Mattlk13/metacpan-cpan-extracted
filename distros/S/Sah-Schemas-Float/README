NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Float - Sah schemas for various floating types

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Sah::Schemas::Float (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Float), released on 2019-04-08.

SAH SCHEMAS
    *   negfloat

        Negative float.

    *   percent

        A float.

        This type is basically "float", with "str_as_percent" coerce rule.
        So the percent sign is optional, but the number is always
        interpreted as percent, e.g. "1" is interpreted as 1% (0.01).

    *   posfloat

        Positive float.

    *   share

        A float between 0 and 1.

        Accepted in one of these forms:

         0.5      # a normal float between 0 and 1
         10       # a float between 1 (exclusive) and 100, interpreted as percent
         10%      # a percentage string, between 0% and 100%

        Due to different interpretations, particularly "1" (some people
        might expect it to mean "0.01" or "1%") use of this type is
        discouraged. Use Sah::Schema::percent instead.

    *   ufloat

        Non-negative float.

        See also "posfloat" for floats that are larger than 0.
