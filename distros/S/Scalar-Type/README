This module grovels in perl's guts to see if a variable really is a number,
as opposed to a string that just looks like a number, and whether it is an
integer or not. ie, it can tell the difference between "100", 100, and 100.0.

100 is an integer.

"100" is a string that looks like an integer.

100.0 is numerically equivalent to 100, but it is only accurate to 4
significant figures.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
