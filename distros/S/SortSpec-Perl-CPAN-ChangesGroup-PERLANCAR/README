NAME
    SortSpec::Perl::CPAN::ChangesGroup::PERLANCAR - Specification to sort
    changes group heading PERLANCAR-style

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    SortSpec::Perl::CPAN::ChangesGroup::PERLANCAR (from Perl distribution
    SortSpec-Perl-CPAN-ChangesGroup-PERLANCAR), released on 2024-01-27.

DESCRIPTION
    A Changes file can group its changes entries into groups with headings,
    e.g.:

     [ENHANCEMENTS]

     - blah blah

     - blah

     [BUG FIXES]

     - blah blah blah

    I sort these group headings according to this principle: prioritize the
    items that:

    *   are more important;

    *   affect users the most;

    *   users would want to know first.

    Thus breaking or backward-incompatible changes are put first because
    they affect existing users and in a significant way. Removed features
    are next, they are also basically backward-incompatible changes.

    Then come new features. After that, enhancements. Bug fixes currently
    come last (actually bug fixes vary in importance but we currently do not
    categorize them further into subgroups).

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
