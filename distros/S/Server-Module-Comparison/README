NAME

    Server::Module::Comparison - check perl module versions installed on
    servers.

VERSION

    version 0.012

SYNOPSIS

    Gets versions of perl modules on servers.

        my $comparer = Server::Module::Comparison->new({
             perl_path => '/opt/perl5/bin',
             modules => [qw/OpusVL::CMS OpusVL::FB11X::CMSView OpusVL::FB11X::CMS/]
         });
        my $versions = $comparer->check_container('quay.io/opusvl/prem-website:staging');
    
    
        my $comparer = Server::Module::Comparison::FromModuleList(
            'modules.txt',
            { perl_path => '/opt/perl5/bin/' }
        );

DESCRIPTION

    A module for checking which versions of a particular list of perl
    modules are installed on a server.

    This relies on mversion (Module::Version) being installed on the server
    to make querying the module version numbers simple.

    This module uses system and isn't expected to defend against malicous
    input at all. It is designed as a quick and simple developer tool.

METHODS

 FromModuleList

    Createa a new Server::Module::Comparison object from a line delimited
    list of modules.

 check_container

    Run mversion in a docker container.

        my $versions = $comparer->check_container('quay.io/user/some-website:staging');

    This is done by running the container locally. It does not try to pull
    the container. It is assumed you have access to docker and the correct
    image to hand.

 check_ssh_server

    Checks modules via ssh.

 check_local

    Checks modules locally.

 check_correct_guess

    This takes a string and guesses whether to assume it's a container
    identifier or an ssh server.

    Also supports a docker:// or ssh:// type uri scheme to help identify
    the server being identified.

ATTRIBUTES

 perl_path

    Location of perl (and therefore also where mversion will be installed).
    Set this if you have your perl installed in a non default location not
    on the path. We have ours installed to /opt/perl5/bin for example.

 modules

    The list of modules to check. This is an array ref.
