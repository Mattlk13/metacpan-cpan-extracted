0.2.6   2016-03-03 (Thu, 3 Mar 2016)
    * Perl::Critic tests should really execute locally (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=107348)

0.2.5   2016-03-02 (Wed, 2 Mar 2016)
    * allow for "generic" objects (blessed references) to be bound against a condition if they have a `to_string()` method
    * inverted Perl::Critic invocation condition

0.2.4   2015-09-16 (Wed, 16 Sep 2015)
    * removed several "write to $_" occurrences that invaded callers' namespace
    * removed several unintended "to_string()" conversions when checking variables
    * fixed sqlValueList to optionally convert its arguments to sqlParameter
    * replaced cumbersome "getLastInsertId" implementation with native DBI code

0.2.3   2015-09-02 (Wed, 2 Sep 2015)
    * code clean-up according to self-defined Perl::Critic rules
    * added "no warning" pragma for experimental features
    * cleaned up and corrected Build.PL

0.2.2   2015-03-18 (Wed, 18 Mar 2015)
    * added: operator overloading for `sqlCondition`s
    * added: `sqlValueDate` and `sqlValueDateTime` binding parameters
    * added: `where()` method accepts `undef` as condition to allow for unconditional queries

    * completed documentation

0.2.1   2015-02-11 (Wed, 11 Feb 2015)
    * added: `limit()` method accepts `undef` as first or both parameters to skip the LIMIT clause
    * fixed: when passing a HASHREF to the `orderBy()` method, subsequent "toString" executes of a query object will leave the HASHREF intact (was modified)

0.2.0   2014-04-07 (Mon, 07 Apr 2014)
    * removed another build-breaker (added "use version" statement [http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/bfc9639c-bbe9-11e3-bf29-e1298806f0e4])
    * changed version number to suppress ("lower version number" warning in PAUSE)

0.1.2   2014-04-03 (Thu, 03 Apr 2014)
    * replaced DBI's `last_insert_id` with (less portable) `LAST_INSERT_ID()` SQL function call
