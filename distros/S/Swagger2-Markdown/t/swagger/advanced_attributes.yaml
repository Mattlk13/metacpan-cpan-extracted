  title: Advanced Attributes API
  description: |
    Improving the previous [Attributes](08.%20Attributes.md) description example, this API example describes the `Coupon` resource attributes (data structure) regardless of the serialization format. These attributes can be later referenced using the resource name

    These attributes are then reused in the `Retrieve a Coupon` action. Since they describe the complete message, no explicit JSON body example is needed.

    Moving forward, the `Coupon` resource data structure is then reused when defining the attributes of the coupons collection resource - `Coupons`.

    The `Create a Coupon` action also demonstrate the description of request attributes - once defined, these attributes are implied on every `Create a Coupon` request unless the request specifies otherwise. Apparently, the description of action attributes is somewhat duplicate to the definition of `Coupon` resource attributes. We will address this in the next [Data Structures](10.%20Data%20Structures.md) example.
