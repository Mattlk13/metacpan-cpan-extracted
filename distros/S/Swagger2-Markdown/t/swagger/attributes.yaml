    This API example demonstrates how to describe body attributes of a request or response message.

    In this case, the description is complementary (and duplicate!) to the provided JSON example in the body section. The [Advanced Attributes](09.%20Advanced%20Attributes.md) API example will demonstrate how to avoid duplicates and how to reuse attributes descriptions.
