  title: Data Structures API
  description: |
    Following [Advanced Attributes](09.%20Advanced%20Attributes.md), this example demonstrates defining arbitrary data structure to be reused by various attribute descriptions.

    Since a portion of the `Coupon` data structure is shared between the `Coupon` definition itself and the `Create a Coupon` action, it was separated into a `Coupon Base` data structure in the `Data Structures` API Blueprint Section. Doing so enables us to reuse it as a base-type of other attribute definitions.
