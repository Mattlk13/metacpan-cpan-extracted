  title: Grouping Resources API
  description: |
    This API example demonstrates how to group resources and form **groups of resources**. You can create as many or as few groups as you like. If you do not create any group all your resources will be part of an "unnamed" group.

    ## API Blueprint
    + [Previous: Named Resource and Actions](03.%20Named%20Resource%20and%20Actions.md)
    + [This: Raw API Blueprint](https://raw.github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/master/examples/04.%20Grouping%20Resources.md)
    + [Next: Responses](05.%20Responses.md)

paths:
  /message:
    x-api-blueprint:
      group: Messages
      summary: My Message
      description: |
        Group of all messages-related resources.

        This is the first group of resources in this document. It is **recognized** by the **keyword `group`** and its name is `Messages`.

        Any following resource definition is considered to be a part of this group until another group is defined. It is **customary** to increase header level of resources (and actions) nested under a resource.

    get:
      summary: Retrieve a Message
      produces:
        - text/plain
      responses:
        200:
          description: The response message
          schema:
            format: string
            example: "Hello World!"
    put:
      summary: Update a Message
      consumes:
        - text/plain
      parameters:
        - in: body
          name: message
          schema:
            format: string
            example: "All your base are belong to us."
      responses:
        204:
          description: The response message
  /users:
    x-api-blueprint:
      group: Users
      summary: My User
      description: |
        Group of all user-related resources.

        This is the second group in this blueprint. For now, no resources were defined here and as such we will omit it from the next installement of this course.
