examples sourced from:

    https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/tree/master/examples

note because of the limitations in converting a swagger spec to API Blueprint
some of the examples have been modified slightly in terms of the order that
endpoints appear and also some tweaking to the attribute types. A couple of
examples have sections removed because swagger does not support multiple diff
reponse types per response code (either based on consumes or produces).

The examples are largely the same and the tweaking here shouldn't affect the
eventual parsing of the API Blueprint file too much[1]. If you're curious you
should diff the examples in this dir with the examples from the above link.

[1] not tested, i have merely looked at the output after parsing these files
