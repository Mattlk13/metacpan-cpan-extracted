NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Str - Various string schemas

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.011 of Sah::Schemas::Str (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Str), released on 2022-07-09.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   hexstr

        String of bytes in hexadecimal.

    *   latin_alpha

        String containing only zero or more Latin letters, i.e. A-Z or a-z.

    *   latin_alphanum

        String containing only zero or more Latin letters/digits, i.e.
        A-Za-z0-9.

    *   latin_letter

        Latin letter, i.e. A-Z or a-z.

    *   str_or_aos

        String or array (0+ length) of (defined) string.

    *   str_or_aos1

        String or array (1+ length) of (defined) string.

    *   str_or_re

        String or regex (if string is of the form `/.../`).

        Either string or Regexp object is accepted.

        If string is of the form of "/.../" or "qr(...)", then it will be
        compiled into a Regexp object. If the regex pattern inside "/.../"
        or "qr(...)" is invalid, value will be rejected.

        Currently, unlike in normal Perl, for the "qr(...)" form, only
        parentheses "(" and ")" are allowed as the delimiter.

        Currently modifiers "i", "m", and "s" after the second "/" are
        allowed.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
