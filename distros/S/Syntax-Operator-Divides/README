NAME

    Syntax::Operator::Divides - an infix operator for division test

SYNOPSIS

    On a suitable perl version:

       use Syntax::Operator::Divides;
    
       say "Multiple of 10" if $x %% 10;

    Or, on a standard perl via Syntax::Keyword::Match:

       use v5.14;
       use Syntax::Keyword::Match;
       use Syntax::Operator::Divides;
    
       foreach ( 1 .. 100 ) {
          match( $_ : %% ) {
             case(15) { say "FizzBuzz" }
             case(3)  { say "Fizz" }
             case(5)  { say "Buzz" }
             default  { say $_ }
          }
       }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an infix operator that implements an integer
    divides test which returns true if the lefthand operand is a whole
    multiple of the righthand.

    Current stable versions of perl do not directly support custom infix
    operators, but the ability was added in the 5.37.x development cycle
    and is available from perl v5.37.7 onwards. The documentation of
    XS::Parse::Infix describes the situation in more detail. This module is
    therefore almost entirely useless on stable perl builds. While the
    regular parser does not support custom infix operators, they are
    supported via XS::Parse::Infix and hence XS::Parse::Keyword, and so
    custom keywords which attempt to parse operator syntax may be able to
    use it.

OPERATORS

 %%

       my $divides = $numerator %% $denominator;

    Yields true if the numerator operand is a whole integer multiple of the
    denominator. This is implemented by using the % modulus operator and
    testing if the remainder is zero.

FUNCTIONS

    As a convenience, the following functions may be imported which
    implement the same behaviour as the infix operators, though are
    accessed via regular function call syntax.

    These wrapper functions are implemented using XS::Parse::Infix, and
    thus have an optimising call-checker attached to them. In most cases,
    code which calls them should not in fact have the full runtime overhead
    of a function call because the underlying test operator will get
    inlined into the calling code at compiletime. In effect, code calling
    these functions should run with the same performance as code using the
    infix operators directly.

 is_divisor

       my $divides = is_divisor( $numerator, $denominator );

    A function version of the "%%" operator.
