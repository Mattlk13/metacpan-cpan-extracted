     use Set::IntSpan::Util qw(intspans2str);

     $str = intspans2str(1);           # => "1"
     $str = intspans2str(1,2,3,4,5);   # => "1-5"

FUNCTIONS
  intspans2str
    Usage:

     my $str = intspans2str([ \%opts, ] @set_spec);

    Given set specification, return a canonical string representation of the
    set.

    This function passes the arguments to Set::IntSpan's constructor and
    then return a canonical string representation of the set, which is a
    comma-separated representation of each contiguous ranges. A
    single-integer range is represented as the integer. A multiple-integers
    range from A to B is represented as "A-B". Examples:

     1
     1-3
     1-3, 5-8
     -Inf-2, 5-8
     5-8, 10-Inf
     -Inf-+Inf

    An optional hashref can be given in the first argument for options.
    Known options:

    *   dash

        Default "-".

    *   comma

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
