NAME

    Syntax::Operator::ExistsOr - an infix operator sensitive to hash
    element existence

SYNOPSIS

    On a suitable perl version:

       use Syntax::Operator::ExistsOr;
    
       sub func ( %args ) {
          my $count = $args{count} \\ 10;
    
          say "Count is ", $count // "<undef>";
       }
    
       func( count => 20 );
       func();
    
       func( count => undef );

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an infix operator that similar to the defined-or
    // core perl operator, but which cares about hash element existence
    rather than definedness.

    Current stable versions of perl do not directly support custom infix
    operators, but the ability was added in the 5.37.x development cycle
    and is available from perl v5.37.7 onwards. The documentation of
    XS::Parse::Infix describes the situation in more detail. This module is
    therefore almost entirely useless on stable perl builds. While the
    regular parser does not support custom infix operators, they are
    supported via XS::Parse::Infix and hence XS::Parse::Keyword, and so
    custom keywords which attempt to parse operator syntax may be able to
    use it.

    This module does not provide wrapper functions for the operators, as
    their inherent short-circuiting behaviour would appear confusing when
    expressed in function-like syntax.

OPERATORS

 \\

       my $value = $hash{$key} \\ EXPR;

    The lefthand operand must be a hash element access (i.e. $hash{$key} or
    $href->{$key} for some expressions yielding a key and a hashref).

    If the hash contains the given key then the operator yields its value
    (even if that value is undef). If the key does not exist in the hash,
    then the righthand operand will be evaluated in scalar context and its
    value returned.

    This is a short-circuiting operator; if the hash does contain the key
    then the righthand side expression is not evaluated at all.

    This operator parses at the same precedence level as the logical-or
    operators (|| and //).

 existsor

       do {
          $hash{$key} existsor EXPR;
       };

    Similar to the \\ operator but parses at the same level as the
    low-precedence or operator (or). This is unlikely to be very useful, as
    normally or would be used for value-less control flow. Such a potential
    use for this operator would be neater written

       exists $hash{$key} or EXPR;

    It is included largely for completeness.
