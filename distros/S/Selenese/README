NAME

    Selenese - Run Selenium IDE tests without the IDE

SYNOPSIS

     selenese

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to run Selenium IDE tests without the IDE.

    This makes your Selenium IDE tests useful for general testing purposes.
    For example, they could be used in a headless Continuous Integration
    environment.

REQUIREMENTS

      * Perl 5.18.2 or greater

      This is probably not a hard requirement, but I've not thought much
      about earlier versions.

      * V8

      On debian and ubuntu this requirement can be satisfied by installing
      the module libv8-dev.
