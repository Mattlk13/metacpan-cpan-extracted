SYNOPSIS

     use String::Elide::Lines qw(elide);

DESCRIPTION

    String::Elide::Lines is based on String::Elide::Parts but works on a
    per-line basis.

FUNCTIONS

 elide($str, $len[, \%opts]) => str

    Elide lines from a string if the string contains more than $len lines.

    String can be marked with <elspan prio=N truncate=T
    marker=M>...</elspan> so there can be multiple parts with different
    priorities and truncate direction. The default priority is 1. You can
    mark less important lines with higher priority to let it be elided
    first. The markup will be removed from the string before eliding.

    Known options:

      * marker => str (default: '..')

      * truncate => 'top'|'middle'|'bottom'|'ends' (default: 'bottom')

      * default_prio => int (default: 1)

SEE ALSO

    String::Elide::Parts is the basis of this module but works on a
    per-character basis. See that module's SEE ALSO for list of other
    string eliding modules.

    Pod::Elide uses this module.
