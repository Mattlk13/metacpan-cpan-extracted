DESCRIPTION
    This module allows to connect to the api of StartCom in order to generate
    or retrieve certificates.

    Please see also the StartAPI documentation
    <https://startssl.com/StartAPI/Docs>.

METHODS
    "$api = new StartCom::API"
        The constructor. Returns a "StartCom::API" object.

    "$api->tokenID($key)"
        Sets or gets the API key.

    "$api->client_cert($pathtoclientcert)"
        Sets or gets the path to the client certificate file (PEM).

    "$api->client_key($pathtoclientkey)"
        Sets or gets the path to the client key file.

    "$api->retrieve($orderID)"
        Retrieves the certificate corresponding to the "orderID" and stores it
        in this object.

        Returns 1 on success, 0 or undef on failure.

    "$api->apply({'certType' => '...', 'CSR' => '...', ...})"
        Applies for a new certificate and, if successful, stores it in this
        object.

    "$api->success"
        Checks whether or not the last call was successful.

    "$api->errormsg"
        Returns the error message if the last call was unsuccessful.

    "$api->certificate"
        If the last call was successful and the certificate was issued, this

    "$api->intermediate"
        If the last call was successful and the certificate was issued, this
        method returns the intermediate certificate.

    "$api->orderID"
