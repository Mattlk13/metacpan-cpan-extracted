        - Fix Oracle 'AS' generation bug (CPAN #100454)

2       2013-04-07
        - Added sqlDo{} and sqlFetch{} for more easy direct embedding into Perl
        - Added prefix AND and OR
        - Allow void context if there is no result
        - BUG FIX: nested AND and OR sometimes expanded only into the outer operand

1.002   2011-08-05/0:00
        - Removed HTML generation from Makefile.PL: not my business (and produced
          'unknown' results on cpantesters)
        - fixed documentation
        - reworked documentation
        - made hash interpolation deterministic by sorting keys
        - BUG FIX: REGRESSION: fixed parens again (WHEN was broken in some cases)
        - FEATURE: sqlCheck{...} + WHEN and hash interpolation
        - throw error in void context so that we can fill this with life later
        - changed required Perl version to 5.8 so that more tests can be done
          (produced 'unknown' results on cpantesters)
        Thanks again to cpantesters!
