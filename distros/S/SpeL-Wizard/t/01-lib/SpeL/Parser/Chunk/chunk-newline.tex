 Some aspects of your text cannot be read out loud or are
  unsensible to read out loud. Think of graphs, drawings, tables
  and other non-text elements. For these you can explicitly provide
  a textual description that will be converted to
  an audio description that your non-text element will link to.\\
  We call these \LaTeX-fragments \emph{explicit chunks}
