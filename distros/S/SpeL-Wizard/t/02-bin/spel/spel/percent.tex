  At our institute, the University of Antwerp, Belgium, the number
  of students with reading and/or writing disorders is
  increasing. If the number of people is not increasing, in any
  case, the number of people aware of the fact that they have a
  reading or writing disorder increases. Approximately 5\% of the
  students are registered with such a disorder. Probably there's an
  additional number of people opting not to register their disorder.
