Often it makes sense to consider the DC-gain of the loop \emph {without the integrators}. We will denote that as $\ktickdc $, i.e. \begin {align} \ktickdc = \lim _{s\to 0} s^Q L(s) = K \frac {(-z_1)(-z_2)\cdots (-z_M)}{(-p_1)(-p_2)\cdots (-p_N)} \end {align} Given the fact that $L(s)$ is dimensionless (symbolically: $[L(s)] = 1$) and due to the multiplication with $s^Q$ in the definition of $\ktickdc $, we must conclude that $\unitof {\ktickdc } = (\unit {\radian \per \second })^Q$.
