Often it makes sense to consider the DC-gain of the loop without the integrators. We will denote that as K tick DC , i.e. K tick DC ,equals, the limit for "s" going to 0 , of: "s" to the power of "Q", times "L" of "s" , ,equals, "K" times minus "z" "1" times minus "z" "2" and so on until minus "z" "M" , over minus "p" "1" times minus "p" "2" and so on until minus "p" "N" Given the fact that "L" of "s" , is dimensionless (symbolically: "L" of "s" , ,equals, 1 ) and due to the multiplication with "s" to the power of "Q", in the definition of K tick DC , we must conclude that the unit of K tick DC ,equals, radian per second to the power of "Q", .
