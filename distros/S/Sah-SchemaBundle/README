NAME
    Sah::SchemaBundle - Convention for Sah-SchemaBundle-* distribution

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.1.0

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.1.1 of Sah::SchemaBundle (from Perl
    distribution Sah-SchemaBundle), released on 2024-02-13.

DESCRIPTION
    A "Sah-SchemaBundle-*" distribution contains one or more related Sah
    schemas.

    *   Put each individual schema in "Sah::Schema::<NAME>" package

        The schema is put in the $schema package variable inside the
        package.

        This enables quick lookup/retrieval of a certain schema.

    *   Schema must be normalized

        This relieves users from having to normalize it themselves.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
