    Sah::Schemas::Phone - Schemas related to phones & phone numbers

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Sah::Schemas::Phone (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Phone), released on 2022-09-23.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   phone::num::idn

        Indonesian phone number, e.g. +628123456789.

        This schema accepts Indonesian phone number e.g. +628123456789. If
        number does not contain country code, it will be assumed to be '+62'
        (Indonesian calling code). Some formatting characters like dashes
        and spaces are accepted, as long as it passes Number::Phone
        formatting. The number will be formatted using international phone
        number formatting by the Number::Phone module, e.g. '+62 812 3456
        789'.

    *   phone::num::int

        International phone number, e.g. +628123456789.

        This schema accepts international phone number e.g. +628123456789.
        Some formatting characters like dashes and spaces are accepted, as
        long as it passes Number::Phone formatting. The number will be
        formatted using international phone number formatting by the
        Number::Phone module, e.g. '+62 812 3456 789'.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
