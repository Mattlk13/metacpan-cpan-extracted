NAME
    Sah::PSchemaBundle::Array - Parameterized schemas related to array type

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.010 of Sah::PSchemaBundle::Array (from
    Perl distribution Sah-PSchemaBundle-Array), released on 2024-05-30.

DESCRIPTION
    The Sah's "array" type supports some basic constraint clauses:
    "min_len", "max_len", "len", "len_between" (for checking number of
    elements), "uniq" (for checking that elements are unique), "has" (for
    checking that a specified value is found in array).

    Until Data::Sah allows easier creation of custom clauses, this
    distribution contains schemas that allow you to perform additional
    checks.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
