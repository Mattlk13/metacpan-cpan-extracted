SYNOPSIS
            use strict;

            use StreamFinder;

            my $station = new StreamFinder(<url>);

            die "Invalid URL or no streams found!\n"  unless ($station);

            my $firstStream = $station->get();

            print "First Stream URL=$firstStream\n";

            my $icon_url = $station->getIconURL();

            if ($icon_url) {   #SAVE THE ICON TO A TEMP. FILE:

                    my ($image_ext, $icon_image) = $station->getIconData();

                    if ($icon_image && open IMGOUT, ">/tmp/${stationID}.$image_ext") {

                            binmode IMGOUT;

                            print IMGOUT $icon_image;

                            close IMGOUT;

            my @streams = $station->get();

            foreach my $s (@streams) {

            }

DESCRIPTION
    StreamFinder accepts a valid radio station or video URL on supported
    websites and returns the actual stream URL(s), title, and cover art icon
    for that station. The purpose is that one needs one of these URLs in
    order to have the option to stream the station / video in one's own
    choice of media player software rather than using their web browser and
    accepting any / all flash, ads, javascript, cookies, trackers, web-bugs,
    and other crapware associated with that method of playing. The author
    uses his own custom all-purpose media player called "fauxdacious" (his
    custom hacked version of the open-source "audacious" audio player).
    "fauxdacious" incorporates this module to decode and play streams.

    The currently-supported websites are: banned.video
    (StreamFinder::BannedVideo), brighteon.com (StreamFinder::Brighteon),
    iheartradio.com (StreamFinder::IHeartRadio), podcasts.apple.com
    (StreamFinder::Apple), radio.net (StreamFinder::RadioNet), radionomy.com
    (StreamFinder::Radionomy), reciva.com (StreamFinder::Reciva), tunein.com
    (StreamFinder::Tunein), vimeo.com (StreamFinder::Vimeo), and
    (youtube.com, et. al and other sites that youtube-dl supports)
    (StreamFinder::Youtube).

    NOTE: Facebook (Streamfinder::Facebook) has been removed because logging
    into Facebook via the call to youtube-dl is now interpreted by Facebook
    as a "rogue app. login" and will cause them to LOCK your account and
    FORCE you to change your password the next time you log in to Facebook!

    NOTE: For some sites, ie. Youtube, Vimeo, Brighteon, and BannedVideo,
    etc. the "station" object actually refers to a specific video or
    podcast, but functions the same way.

    Each site is supported by a separate subpackage
    (StreamFinder::*Package*), which is determined and selected based on the
    URL when the StreamFinder object is created. The methods are overloaded
    by the selected subpackage's methods.

    Please see the POD. documentation for each subpackage for important
    additional information on options and features specific to each site /
    subpackage!

    One or more playable streams can be returned for each station / video /
    podcast, along with at least a "title" (station name / video or podcast
    title) and an icon image URL ("iconurl" - if found). Additional
    information that MAY be fetched is a (larger?) banner image
    ("imageurl"), a (longer?) "description", an "artist" / author, a
    "genre", and a "year" (podcasts, videos, etc.). Some sites also provide
    station's FCC call letters ("fccid"). For icon and image URLs, functions
    exist (getIconData() and getImageData() to fetch the actual binary data
    and mime type for downloading to local storage for use by your preferred
    media player.

    If you have another streaming site that is not supported, please file a
    feature request via email or the CPAN bug system, or (for faster
    service), provide a Perl patch module / program source that can extract
    some or all of the necessary information for streams on that site and
    I'll consider it! The easiest way to do this is to take one of the
    existing submodules, copy it to "StreamFinder::*YOURSITE*.pm and modify
    it (and the POD docs) to your specific site's needs, test it on several
    of their pages (see the "SYNOPSIS" code above), and send it to me
    (That's what I do)!

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    new(*url* [, *options* ])
        Accepts a URL and creates and returns a new station object, or
        *undef* if the URL is not a valid station or no streams are found.

        NOTE: A full URL must be specified here, but if using any of the
        subpackage modules directly instead, then either a full URL OR just
        the station / video's site ID may be used! Reason being that this
        function parses the full URL to determine which subpackage (site)
        module to use.

        *options* can vary depending on the type of stream (site) that is
        being queried. One option common to all sites is *-debug*, which
        turns on debugging output. A numeric option can follow specifying
        the level (0, 1, or 2). 0 is none, 1 is basic, 2 is detailed.
        Default: 1 (if *-debug* is specified).

    $station->get()
        Returns an array of strings representing all stream URLs found.

    $station->getURL([*options*])
        Similar to get() except it only returns a single stream representing
        the first valid stream found.

        Current options are: *"random"* and *"noplaylists"*. By default, the
        first ("best"?) stream is returned. If *"random"* is specified, then
        a random one is selected from the list of streams found. If
        *"noplaylists"* is specified, and the stream to be returned is a
        "playlist" (.pls or .m3u? extension), it is first fetched and the
        first entry in the playlist is returned. This is needed by
        Fauxdacious Mediaplayer since Fauxdacious intentionally does not
        allow recursive playlists.

    $station->count()
        Returns the number of streams found for the station.

    $station->getStationID(['fccid'])
        Returns the station's site ID (default), or station's FCC
        call-letters ("fccid") for applicable sites and stations.

    $station->getTitle(['desc'])
        Returns the station's title, or (long description).

        NOTE: Some sights do not support a separate long description field,
        so if none found, the standard title field will always be returned.

    $station->getIconURL()
        Returns the URL for the station's "cover art" icon image, if any.

    $station->getIconData()
        Returns a two-element array consisting of the extension (ie. "png",
        "gif", "jpeg", etc.) and the actual icon image (binary data), if
        any. This makes it easy to download the image to local storage for
        use by your preferred media player.

    $station->getImageURL()
        Returns the URL for the station's "cover art" banner image, if any.

        NOTE: If no "banner image" (usually a larger image) is found, the
        "icon image" URL will be returned.

    $station->getImageData()
        Returns a two-element array consisting of the extension (ie. "png",
        "gif", "jpeg", etc.) and the actual station's banner image (binary
        data). This makes it easy to download the image to local storage for
        use by your preferred media player.

        NOTE: If no "banner image" (usually a larger image) is found, the
        "icon image" data will be returned.

    $station->getType()
        Returns the station's type (*submodule-name*). (one of: "Apple",
        "BannedVideo", "IHeartRadio", "RadioNet", "Radionomy", "Reciva",
        "Tunein", "Youtube" or "Vimeo" - depending on the sight that matched
        the URL.

CONFIGURATION FILES
    ~/.config/StreamFinder/config
        Optional text file for specifying various configuration options.
        Each option is specified on a separate line in the format below:

        'option' => 'value' [,]

        and the options are loaded into a hash used by all sites
        (submodules) that support them. Valid options include *-debug* =>
        [0|1|2], and most of the LWP::UserAgent options. Blank lines and
        lines starting with a "#" sign are ignored.

    ~/.config/StreamFinder/*submodule*/config
        Optional text file for specifying various configuration options for
        a specific site (submodule, ie. "Youtube" for
        StreamFinder::Youtube). Each option is specified on a separate line
        in the format below:

        'option' => 'value' [,]

        and the options are loaded into a hash used only by the specific
        (submodule) specified. Valid options include *-debug* => [0|1|2],
        and most of the LWP::UserAgent options.

        Options specified here override any specified in
        *~/.config/StreamFinder/config*.

    NOTE: Options specified in the options parameter list will override
    those corresponding options specified in these files.
