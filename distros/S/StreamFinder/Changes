        as either "debug", "-debug", "debug => 1", or "-debug => 1" in

        (ie. my $station = new StreamFinder($url, -debug => 1);
        - Better handle ".m3u8" streams returned by brighteon.com (Youtube).
1.05    2019/09/03
        - Add StreamFinder::BannedVideo (https://banned.video/) to handle

        - StreamFinder::RadioNet: (https://www.radion.net/) ADDED
        - StreamFinder::Tunein: RESTORED (now uses StreamFinder::Youtube for 
        stream fetching), but adds metadata loading (which youtube-dl does 
        not currently fetch for these streams.
        - StreamFinder::IHeartRadio: Add podcast-playing capability.
        - Add user-configuration files (~/.config/StreamFinder/config, 
        ~/.config/StreamFinder/<submodule>/config (see docs).
        User can now specify / override most LWP::UserAgent options, ie. 
        "agent", "timeout", etc. in the new configuration files.
        - Greatly reduce falling back to wget by adding default user-agent 
        and checking for wget availability.

        user-configuration files.

        replacing them with new -keep and -skip arguments and configuration 
        file entries.
        - StreamFinder::Youtube: Better handle "chunky" brighteon.com 
        .m3u8 video streams.  Also add "-notitle" option, streamlining 
        use by StreamFinder::Tunein (see docs).
        - StreamFinder::BannedVideo:  Add "-keep" option to better control 
        type and order of streams returned (see docs).
