Revision history for sbokeeper.

2.04 (2/6/2025):
  Added:
    * Blacklist config option: Specify a list of packages that sbokeeper will
      ignore. Added corresponding --blacklist option.
  Changes:
    * Changed tack{ish} output message.
  Fixes:
    * Fixed some grammatical errors in the documentation.
  Removed:
    * Removed data file documentation from manpage. The original reason I
      documented the format was so that users could edit the data files
      themselves if they had to, although it was greatly discouraged. Now with
      the addition of blacklists, there are even more footguns when it comes to
      editting data files, so I'd thought it would be better to not even
      suggest the idea to users. The documentation has been moved to
      Database.pm's POD, so those who are interested in the format still have
      access to it.

2.03 (1/16/2025):
  Added:
    * rdeps command: Print reverse dependencies for specified package.
    * rtree command: Print reverse dependency tree for specified package(s).

2.02 (1/9/2025):
  Added:
    * 'untracked' package category: Represents SlackBuild packages installed on
      your system that are not present in the database.
    * 'phony' package category: Represents packages that are present in your
      database but are not actually installed on your system.
    * The sbokeeper script now has tests itself. The new tests now require
      File::Spec and Cwd, which shouldn't be a problem as they are distributed
      with core Perl.
    * Slackware::SBoKeeper::Home tests.
  Improvements:
    * Improved wording/grammar in documentation.

2.01 (1/1/2025):
  Added:
    * -t/--tag option: Specify a SlackBuild package tag. Corresponding 'Tag'
      option for config files.
    * 'print' command can now accept multiple categories as argument.
    * RESTRICTIONS section to manual.
    * Recognize slackrepo's default repo path.
  Improvements:
    * 'diff' now warns the user if a differing package does not exist in the
      repo.
  Fixes:
    * Config file options can now be set to the string '0'.

2.00 (12/18/2024):
  This release I intended to refactor sbokeeper so that it would be less
  monolithic and easier to use some of its components in other projects. This
  shouldn't have much of an impact on its usage other than the deprecation of
  the PkgtoolLogs configuration option.
  Added:
    * 'print' command now accepts category aliases as argument.
    * sbotools2 is now a detected SlackBuild package manager (for determining
      default repo path).
  Improvements:
    * Completely refactored project structure; trying to structure sbokeeper so
      that it's less monolithic. Shouldn't have any effect noticable to the
      user.
    * Completely refactored test suite. Components other than the database
      stuff are now tested.
    * Better error message when a data file is required but not found.
  Fixes:
    * Documented slpkg as a detected package manager.
  Removed:
    * Deprecated PkgtoolLogs configuration option and friends. Should only
      affect non-Slackware users trying the 'diff' or 'pull' commands.
    * Removed included SlackBuild script. Please use the SlackBuild script
      available on SlackBuilds.org.

1.02 (12/9/2024):
  Added:
    * 'clean' command (equivalent to 'rm @unnecessary').
  Fixes:
    * Fix incorrect info in help messages.
    * Fix grammatical errors.
  Improvements:
    * Made error messages more helpful.

1.01 (11/21/2024):
  Fixes:
    * LICENSE file now contains perl license rather than Artistic License 2.0.
    * Require List::Util 1.45, as that is the version that introduced uniq().

1.00 (10/31/2024):
  Added:
    * $VERSION to Slackware::SBoKeeper::DataFile.
    * Slackware::SBoKeeper::DataFile now has POD.
    * META files.
  Improvements:
    * Makefile.PL checks ExtUtils::MakeMaker version before using some features.
    * Tests now have test plans.
  Changes:
    * Rename CHANGELOG to Changes.
  Removed:
    * SlackBuild stuff from distribution.

0.04 (10/24/2024):
  DISCLAIMER:
    * Previous version data files are not compatible with new version as
      sbokeeper has changed it's data file format. You will have to rebuild your
      databases manually.
  Improvements:
    * sbokeeper now tries to determine the current Slackware release rather than
      blindly assuming 15.0. This only really affects determining the default
      SlackBuild repo path, but maybe it'll be useful in the future.
    * sbokeeper intelligently determines default SlackBuild repo path based on
      your installed SlackBuild package management tools. It no longer just
      blindly defaults to sbopkg's.
    * tree dies when given package that is not in database.
  Changes:
    * depadd now adds dependencies to database if they are not already present.
    * extradeps command has been renamed to depextra.
    * missing command has been renamed to depwant.
    * sbokeeper now uses own format for storing SlackBuild data instead of JSON.
  Removed:
    * JSON dependency. Now installable on a stock Slackware system.
    * -j option.


0.03 (10/14/2024):
  Added:
    * SlackBuild.
    * Can now read multiline REQUIRES lines.
    * sbokeeper now uses getpwuid for home directory if HOME environment
      variable is unavailable.
    * 'pull' command: Adds installed SlackBuilds.org packages to your database.
    * 'diff' command: Show discrepancies between installed SlackBuild packages
      and packages present in your database.
    * 'missing' command: Show packages missing dependencies.
    * 'extradeps' command: Show packages with extraneous dependencies.
    * -p/--pkgtool-logs option: Specify path to pkgtool package log directory.
    * -j/--pretty-json option: Outputted JSON can now be formatted prettily.
    * PkgtoolLogs config option, same thing as -p option.
    * PrettyJSON config option, same thing as -j option.
    * 'DATA FILES' section to manual, in case a user wants to edit the JSON
      data files themselves.
    * Slackware::SBoKeeper output methods now take prettiness argument.
    * Slackware::SBoKeeper->missing now returns hash map of packages and their
      missing dependencies rather than just a list.
    * Tests for reading/writing JSON data files.
  Changes:
    * If no input is given at a y/n prompt, default to no.
    * y/n prompt no longer breaks line.
    * Outputted JSON is now canonical (sorted).
    * read/write tests now run before add/remove tests.
    * help command is no longer case sensitive.
    * Packages in package lists are now printed on seperate lines.
  Fixes:
    * Stricter REQUIRES checking.
  Removed:
    * Removed example sbokeeper.conf. There's no easy way to install it using
      MakeMaker.
    * Data::Dumper is now longer used, leftover from early development.

0.02 (10/11/2024):
  Changes:
    * Renaming project to sbokeeper, as depsbo sounds too similar to sbodep, a
      project which does something kind of similar to depsbo. sbokeeper is a
      more accurate name anyway.
  Fixes:
    * tree command no longer tries to print tree for missing dependencies. They
      are now labelled as missing.

0.01 (10/10/2024)
  Initial release.
