# 1:
This directory exists for testing Slackware::SBoKeeper::Database.

# mpv:
This directory contains the info files of all SlackBuilds needed to build mpv.
I use this to test the sbokeeper script itself. I thought mpv would be a good
fit because it has a decently complex package tree that would be suitable to
test the various sbokeeper commands. Each SlackBuild directory only contains
the .info file and a .SlackBuild with everything but the original license
removed.
