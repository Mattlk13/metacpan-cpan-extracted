SQL::Interpol

This module converts SQL fragments interleaved with variable references
into one regular SQL string along with a list of bind values, suitable
for passing to DBI. This makes database code easier to read as well as
easier to write, while easily providing ready access to all SQL
features.

SQL::Interpol is a drop-in replacement for most of SQL::Interp. (Some
features have been removed; please refer to the changelog.)
