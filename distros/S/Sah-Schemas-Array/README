NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Array - Sah schemas related to array type

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Sah::Schemas::Array (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Array), released on 2023-02-03.

DESCRIPTION
    The Sah's "array" type supports some basic constraint clauses:
    "min_len", "max_len", "len", "len_between" (for checking number of
    elements), "uniq" (for checking that elements are unique), "has" (for
    checking that a specified value is found in array).

    Until Data::Sah allows easier creation of custom clauses, this
    distribution contains schemas that allow you to perform additional
    checks.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   array::int::contiguous

        An array of a single contiguous range of integers.

    *   array::int::monotonically_decreasing

        An array of integers with monotonically decreasing elements.

        This is like the "array::num::monotonically_decreasing" schema
        except elements must be integers.

    *   array::int::monotonically_increasing

        An array of integers with monotonically increasing elements.

        This is like the "array::num::monotonically_increasing" schema
        except elements must be integers.

    *   array::int::reverse_sorted

        An array of reversely sorted integers.

        This is like the "array::num::reverse_sorted" schema except elements
        must be integers.

    *   array::int::sorted

        An array of sorted integers.

        This is like the "array::num::sorted" schema except elements must be
        integers.

    *   array::num::monotonically_decreasing

        An array of numbers with monotonically decreasing elements.

        Use this schema if you want to accept an array of numbers where the
        elements are monotonically decreasing, i.e. "elem(i) < elem(i-1) for
        all i > 0". It's similar to the "array::num::reverse_sorted" schema
        except that duplicate numbers are not allowed (e.g. "[4, 2, 2, 1]"
        is okay for "array::num::reverse_sorted" but will fail
        "array::num::monotonically_decreasing").

    *   array::num::monotonically_increasing

        An array of numbers with monotonically increasing elements.

        Use this schema if you want to accept an array of numbers where the
        elements are monotonically increasing, i.e. "elem(i) > elem(i-1) for
        all i > 0". It's similar to the "array::num::sorted" schema except
        that duplicate numbers are not allowed (e.g. "[1, 2, 2, 4]" is okay
        for "array::num::sorted" but will fail
        "array::num::monotonically_increasing").

    *   array::num::reverse_sorted

        An array of reversely sorted numbers.

        Use this schema if you want to accept an array of reversely sorted
        numbers, i.e. "elem(i) <= elem(i-1) for all i > 0".

        See also: "array::num::monotonically_decreasing" and
        "array::num::sorted" schemas.

    *   array::num::sorted

        An array of sorted numbers.

        Use this schema if you want to accept an array of sorted numbers,
        i.e. "elem(i) >= elem(i-1) for all i > 0".

        See also: "array::num::monotonically_increasing" and
        "array::num::reverse_sorted" schemas.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
