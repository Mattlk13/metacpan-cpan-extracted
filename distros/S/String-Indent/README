NAME
    String::Indent - String indenting routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.040 of String::Indent (from Perl
    distribution String-Indent), released on 2024-01-25.

FUNCTIONS
  indent($indent, $str, \%opts) => STR
    Indent every line in $str with $indent. Example:

     indent('  ', "one\ntwo\nthree") # "  one\n  two\n  three"

    %opts is optional. Known options:

    *   indent_blank_lines => bool (default: 1)

        If set to false, does not indent blank lines (i.e., lines containing
        only zero or more whitespaces).

    *   first_line_indent => str

        If set, then the first line will be set to this instead of the
        normal indent.

    *   first_line_of_para_indent => str

        If set, then the first line of each paragraph will be set to this
        instead of the normal indent.

    *   subsequent_lines_indent => str

        If set, then all lines but the first line will be set to this
        instead of the normal indent.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
