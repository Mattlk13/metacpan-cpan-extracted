FUNCTIONS

 indent($indent, $str, \%opts) => STR

    Indent every line in $str with $indent. Example:

     indent('  ', "one\ntwo\nthree") # "  one\n  two\n  three"

    %opts is optional. Known options:

      * indent_blank_lines => bool (default: 1)

      If set to false, does not indent blank lines (i.e., lines containing
      only zero or more whitespaces).

      * first_line_indent => str

      If set, then the first line will be set to this instead of the normal
      indent.

      * subsequent_lines_indent => str

      If set, then all lines but the first line will be set to this instead
      of the normal indent.
