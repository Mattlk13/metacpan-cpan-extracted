NAME
    Sort::BySimilarity - Sort by most similar to a reference string

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Sort::BySimilarity (from Perl
    distribution Sort-BySimilarity), released on 2024-01-19.

SYNOPSIS
     use Sort::BySimilarity qw(
         gen_sorter_by_similarity
         gen_cmp_by_similarity
         sort_by_similarity
     );

     #                               reverse?  case insensitive?  args
     my $sorter = gen_sorter_by_similarity(0,        0,                 {string=>"foo"});
     my @sorted = $sorter->("food", "foolish", "foo", "bar"); #

     # or, in one go
     my @sorted = sort_by_similarity(0, 0, {string=>"foo"}, "food", "foolish", "foo", "bar");

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  gen_sorter_by_similarity
    Usage:

     my $sorter = gen_sorter_by_similarity($is_reverse, $is_ci, \%args);

    Will generate a sorter subroutine $sorter which accepts list and will
    sort them and return the sorted items. $is_reverse is a bool, can be set
    to true to generate a reverse sorter (least similar items will be put
    first). $is_ci is a bool, can be set to true to sort case-insensitively.

    Arguments:

    *   string

        Str. Required. Reference string to be compared against each item.

  sort_by_similarity
    Usage:

     my @sorted = sort_by_similarity($is_reverse, $is_ci, \%args, @items);

    A shortcut to generate sorter and sort items with sorter in one go.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
