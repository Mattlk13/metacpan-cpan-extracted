Switch::Reftype

Sometimes, you want your subroutine or method to perform a specific
action based on the type of argument given. For example, your subroutine
might accept either a simple scalar, an array reference, or a hash
reference. Depending on which type of argument your subroutine got, it
has to act slightly differently. The Switch::Reftype family of functions
help you to easily codify these differences.

Switch::Reftype relies heavily on "reftype" in Scalar::Util from
Scalar::Util module.
