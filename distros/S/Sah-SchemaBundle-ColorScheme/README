NAME
    Sah::SchemaBundle::ColorScheme - Sah schemas related to color schemes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Sah::SchemaBundle::ColorScheme
    (from Perl distribution Sah-SchemaBundle-ColorScheme), released on
    2024-06-21.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   perl::colorscheme::modname

        Perl module in the Graphics::ColorNames::* namespace, without the
        namespace prefix, e.g. "WWW", "X".

DESCRIPTION
    "Color schemes" refers to modules in the Graphics::ColorNames::*
    namespace. There is also the "color themes" term which refers to modules
    in the ColorTheme::* (or "WHATEVER::ColorTheme::*") namespace. The color
    theme modules allow defining color items that have background color (in
    addition to foreground color), as well as dynamic color (coderef).

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
