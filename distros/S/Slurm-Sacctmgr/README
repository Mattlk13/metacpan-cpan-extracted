Slurm::Sacctmgr is copyright 2014-2016 by the University of Maryland.

Slurm-Sacctmgr version 1.0.1
===========================

This is a wrapper around the Slurm sacctmgr command.  Basically, it provides
some methods so that one can call the sacctmgr command from within Perl.
There are subclasses for the various entity types recognized by the
sacctmgr command, and for the entity types which can be used with the sacctmgr
list/show  sub-commands there are methods which parse the output into more
Perl friendly objects.  There are also some methods for specific common
tasks (e.g. zeroing the usage on a slurm account, or setting the GrpCPUMins
field for a slurm account).

The Slurm::Sacctmgr package also supports verbose and dryrun modes.  The
former essentially prints out the commands as they are being executed, the 
latter essentially prints out the commands instead of executing them (exceptions
are made for commands which do not update the slurm databases, which you
generally want to run when debugging your code or it won't get to the parts 
which really need debugging).

The Perl package basically wraps calls to the Slurm sacctmgr command, and does
not directly talk to the Slurm databases.  This has pros and cons, but as
the Slurm sacctmgr command seems to have a fairly stable interface, the Perl
module should be fairly stable as well.  Linking to Slurm libraries might have
performance benefits, but this did not seem like code that needs to be highly
optimized.  Using the wrapper approach also makes for easier correlation 
between manual procedures thereby easing the automation of routine procedures.

It has been used in production at UMD, with several Slurm versions (mainly 
with Slurm version 14.11.7 at time of writing).  

This is a pure Perl module; no compilation, etc. required.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The Sacctmgr.pm defaults to looking for 'sacctmgr' in the PATH of the
user running the code, but you can edit the file if you wish a different
default 'sacctmgr' to be used.  The caller can always specify a path.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires you to have Slurm installed, and in particular the
sacctmgr command, in order to be of use.
