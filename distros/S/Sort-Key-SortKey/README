NAME
    Sort::Key::SortKey - Thin wrapper for Sort::Key to easily use SortKey::*

    distribution Sort-Key-SortKey), released on 2024-01-24.

SYNOPSIS
     use Sort::Key::SortKey qw(nkeysort);

     my @sorted = nkeysort "pattern_count=string.foo", @items; # see SortKey::Num::pattern_count
     my @sorted = nkeysort [pattern_count => {string=>"foo"}], @items; # ditto
     ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a thin wrapper for Sort::Key. Instead of directly specifying a

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
