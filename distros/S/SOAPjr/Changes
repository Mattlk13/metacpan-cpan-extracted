1.1.0   4 Dec 2008
        - Added SOAPjr::response::add_error() utility method that expects a property, optional context (defaults to BODY) and an error { code => NNN, message => blah }

        - Added the use of Carp for warning about missing params, etc.
        - Separated SOAPjr::response::send() - output() returns the serialised object and send() calls output() and prints what's returned
