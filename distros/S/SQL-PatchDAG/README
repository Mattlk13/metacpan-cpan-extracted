SQL::PatchDAG

This module manages a directory containing SQL files that must be run in
a particular order. This order is specified implicitly by the contents of
the files: each of them must contain a dependency declaration, which the
module provides code to help maintain. This provides a merge-friendly way
to introduce schema patches in a code base across multiple branches.

Patch application itself is up the caller. The module does not talk to a
database.
