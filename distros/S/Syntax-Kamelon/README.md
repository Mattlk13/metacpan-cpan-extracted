# Kamelon

Kamelon is a versatile and fully programmable textual content parser that is 
extremely well suited for syntax highlighting and code folding

Kamelon is written in Perl (5).

# Installation

 perl Makefile.PL
 
 make
 
 make test
 
 make install

The distribution contains a number of modules and scripts that use Wx.
It is not a pre-requisite for Kamelon itself. But if you want to use
the graphical interface modules that come along with the distribution
you might want to install Wx.

# State of development

Kamelon parsing mechanism is stable and fully developed. The formatting
side of Kamelon is coming out of alpha phase. Documentation is well
underway but still rather spartan. There is a working output interface
for use with the template toolkit.

# Development plans

 Improve speed by Rewriting some core functions of Kamelon in C
 
 Add output formatters for HTML5, PDF, RTF, ODT, etcetera

Help and support is appreciated.
