NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Unix - Various Sah schemas for Unix

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.020 of Sah::Schemas::Unix (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Unix), released on 2022-07-24.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   unix::dirname

        Directory name (with optional path) on a Unix system.

        This is just a convenient alias for dirname::unix.

    *   unix::filename

        File name (with optional path) on a Unix system.

        This is just a convenient alias for filename::unix.

    *   unix::gid

        Group identifier (GID).

        Note that this schema does not check whether the GID exists (has
        record in the user database e.g. "/etc/group"). To do that, use the
        "unix::gid::exists" schema.

    *   unix::gid::exists

        Group identifier (GID) that has to exist on the system.

        Existing means having a group name associated with this GID, i.e.
        "getgrgid" returns a record.

        Support coercion from an existing group name.

    *   unix::groupname

        Unix group name.

        The checking follows POSIX rules: does not begin with a hyphen and
        only contains [A-Za-z0-9._-].

        The above rule allows integers like 1234, which can be confused with
        GID, so this schema disallows pure integers.

        The maximum length is 32 following libc6's limit.

        Note that this schema does not check whether the group name exists
        (has record in the user database e.g. "/etc/group"). To do that, use
        the "unix::groupname::exists" schema.

    *   unix::groupname::exists

        Unix group name that must exist on the system.

        Support coercion from GID.

    *   unix::pathname

        Path name (filename or dirname) on a Unix system.

        This is just a convenient alias for pathname::unix.

    *   unix::pid

        Process identifier (PID).

    *   unix::signal

        Unix signal name (e.g. TERM or KILL) or number (9 or 15).

    *   unix::uid

        User identifier (UID).

        Note that this schema does not check whether the UID exists (has
        record in the user database e.g. "/etc/passwd"). To do that, use the
        "unix::uid::exists" schema.

    *   unix::uid::exists

        User identifier (UID) that has to exist (has associated username) on
        the system.

        Existing means having a user name associated with this UID, i.e.
        "getpwuid" returns a record.

        Support coercion from an existing user name.

    *   unix::username

        Unix account name.

        The checking follows POSIX rules: does not begin with a hyphen and
        only contains [A-Za-z0-9._-].

        The above rule allows integers like 1234, which can be confused with
        UID, so this schema disallows pure integers.

        The maximum length is 32 following libc6's limit.

        Note that this schema does not check whether the user name exists
        (has record in the user database e.g. "/etc/group"). To do that, use
        the "unix::username::exists" schema.

    *   unix::username::exists

        Unix user name that must exist on the system.

        Support coercion from UID.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
