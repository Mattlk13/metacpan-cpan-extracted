NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Unix - Various Sah schemas for Unix

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.017 of Sah::Schemas::Unix (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Unix), released on 2021-07-22.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   unix::dirname

        Directory name (with optional path) on a Unix system.

        This is just a convenient alias for dirname::unix.

    *   unix::filename

        File name (with optional path) on a Unix system.

        This is just a convenient alias for filename::unix.

    *   unix::gid

        Group identifier (GID).

    *   unix::groupname

        Unix group name.

        The checking follows POSIX rules: does not begin with a hyphen and
        only contains [A-Za-z0-9._-].

        The above rule allows integers like 1234, which can be confused with
        GID, so this schema disallows pure integers.

        The maximum length is 32 following libc6's limit.

    *   unix::local_gid

        Group identifier (GID) that has to exist on the system.

        Existing means having a group name associated with this GID, i.e.
        "getgrgid" returns a record.

        Support coercion from an existing group name.

    *   unix::local_groupname

        Unix group name that must exist on the system.

        Support coercion from GID.

    *   unix::local_uid

        User identifier (UID) that has to exist (has associated username) on
        the system.

        Existing means having a user name associated with this UID, i.e.
        "getpwuid" returns a record.

        Support coercion from an existing user name.

    *   unix::local_username

        Unix user name that must exist on the system.

        Support coercion from UID.

    *   unix::pathname

        Path name (filename or dirname) on a Unix system.

        This is just a convenient alias for pathname::unix.

    *   unix::pid

        Process identifier (PID).

    *   unix::signal

        Unix signal name (e.g. TERM or KILL) or number (9 or 15).

    *   unix::uid

        User identifier (UID).

    *   unix::username

        Unix account name.

        The checking follows POSIX rules: does not begin with a hyphen and
        only contains [A-Za-z0-9._-].

        The above rule allows integers like 1234, which can be confused with
        UID, so this schema disallows pure integers.

        The maximum length is 32 following libc6's limit.
