Recommended installation method:
================================

The canonical installation method is to unpack the tarball into some
convenient directory in an ordinary user's home directory tree, build
the Makefile using 'perl Makefile.PL', then run 'make' three times as
shown in the following example:

$  cd ~/sources
$  tar xzvf sendmail-pmilter-1.27.tgz
$  cd sendmail-pmilter-1.27
$  perl Makefile.PL
$  make
$  make test
$  su
#  make install
#  exit
$

On any Unix-like operating system you will of course probably need to
have root permissions for the 'make install' step, hence the 'su' step
(followed by giving root's password) before the 'make install' step.

Some systems are set up to use 'sudo', and instead of 'su' to the root
user followed by giving the 'make install' command as root you may for
example be able to do a single step such as

$ sudo make install

Your prompts may or may not look like the prompts shown above, and the
output of the commands shown above is NOT shown - there will probably
be quite a lot of output in a successful installation, consider use of
the 'script' utility for example if you want to capture it.

Alternative installation method:
================================

If (a) you know what you're doing and (b) you have no need to run the
tests automatically and install the examples, it is sufficient instead
of the canonical installation method simply to copy the two modules

PMilter.pm
PMilter/Context.pm

into a directory such as

/usr/local/lib/site-perl/Sendmail/

which you have ensured that Perl can find on the system when needed.

After copying the files you should have them stored as

/usr/local/lib/site-perl/Sendmail/PMilter.pm

and

/usr/local/lib/site-perl/Sendmail/PMilter/Context.pm

Take great care with the file permissions if you do this.
