Switch::Right version 0.000005

This module redesigns the defunct smartmatching and given>/when mechanisms
so that they're easier to use and easier to understand. It implements a version
of smartmatching with only six rules to remember, eliminates all of the magical
auto-distributivity of "when expressions", and provides clearer and more
explicit ways to specify all those complicated and hard-to-remember special-case
"match any of..." and "match all of..." behaviours.

It's the switch feature re-imagined...and done right this time.
