=item Invalid indentation

If the error includes C<did not find expected key>, you may have a problem with
your indentation levels. Check your indentation levels to ensure they match up
correctly.

=item Tabs instead of spaces

If the error includes C<found character that cannot start any token>, you may
have a C<Tab> character for indentation. YAML does not allow tabs for
indentation.
