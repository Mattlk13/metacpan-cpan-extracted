The Bootstrap theme is back as an option! Use `::bootstrap` as your theme to get it!

A breaking change: The [Store's find_files method](/pod/Statocles/Store/File#find_files)
now skips paths that look like documents by default. If you need to old behavior,
pass in `include_documents => 1` to the method.

That change was made to support ".md" as a document file extension. Previously, only
".markdown" was supported. This is a work-in-progress, so if there are any bugs,
[file a bug report](http://github.com/preaction/Statocles/issues).
