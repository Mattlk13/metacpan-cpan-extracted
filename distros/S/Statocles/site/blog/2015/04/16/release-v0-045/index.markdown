A couple small changes in this release:

Blog posts are now allowed to have images inside the post directory. This makes
it a lot easier to add images to blogs. You don't need to configure a global
`/images` directory. You can put your image in `/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title`.
Even better, you get to refer to it in your post as `![](image.jpg)`.

The [link check plugin](/pod/Statocles/Plugin/LinkCheck) now correctly finds
links the URL encoded characters.

The recent posts helper now allows filtering by tag, if, for example, you want to
display only the last `release` blog and not any other blog post.

`statocles daemon` now allows setting `-p <port>`, in case port 3000 is in-use, or
you need to run multiple instances.
