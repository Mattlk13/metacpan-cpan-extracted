The biggest new thing in this release is the new [LinkCheck
plugin](/pod/Statocles/Plugin/LinkCheck) that checks all the pages for
broken links and images. This introduces a new event-handling API into
Statocles, which will be called Plugins. See [the developer
docs](/pod/Statocles/Help/Develop) for more information on plugins.

A bunch of bug fixes for the `create` command. It now actually works, instead
of creating an unusable `site.yml` file.

The default build directory is now `.statocles/build` instead of `.statocles-build`.
It is anticipated we might use the `.statocles` directory for some additional
site metadata.

With [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us) 6.0 release, there were a few breaking
changes that we needed to fix in Statocles. We now require 6.0.
