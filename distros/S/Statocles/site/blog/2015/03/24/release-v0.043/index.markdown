A couple interesting changes this week!

There was a case where two apps could produce pages with the same path. Now, this
produces a warning, and there's an attempt to do the right thing by making pages
generated by apps more important than files simply being copied.

The `url_root` attribute was moved to the Statocles::App class, so that all
apps have it. This will prevent an app forgetting to add it.  In order to make
this work, some new methods were added to the Statocles::App class to build
URLs and links with the right URL root.

It's now a lot easier to use a default Theme and still get some minor
customizations by specifying one or more include directories. See [the
Statocles Theme guide](/pod/Statocles/Help/Theme) for more information.

A single Git repository can now have any number of site deploys inside. Just make
sure the path is somewhere in the Git repository's working tree.

With Moo 2 coming out, Moo::Lax is not needed, so we've changed our dependency to
Moo 2.
