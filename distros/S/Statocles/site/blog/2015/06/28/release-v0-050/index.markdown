title: Release v0.050

Some minor doc fixes, and a fix to ensure that all links are properly rewritten
to include the site base URL.

Also, a reverse from the last release that added an annoying background color
to the footer of the default theme (and, by extention, any theme extended from
the default theme).

Full changelog below...
