Here starts the road to v1.0! Some breaking changes in this release:

Statocles::Page::Feed is now removed. The functionality has been added to all
pages, and all the feed templates have been updated accordingly. This means you
must update your themes to grab the new feed templates.

To fix a long-standing bug with blog content not showing up correctly on the
list pages (index, tag lists), the
[Statocles::Page::ListItem](/pod/Statocles/Page/ListItem) class was added.
This class proxies another page and rewrites its content to survive intact
inside a list page.

Some minor things:

External perldoc links are now explicitly labelled as such with a
[FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io) icon.

Some doc updates to start documenting the [App API](/pod/Statocles/App).

Full changelog below...
