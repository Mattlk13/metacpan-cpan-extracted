A bunch of bugfixes in this release, including one that could have prevented
users from upgrading from previous versions due to a test failure.

Most importantly, pagination in the blog is working again.

Some additions to the [Content help guide](/pod/Statocles/Help/Content)
about a the new features over the last few releases, and one new feature adding
a `data` attribute to [Statocles::Document](/pod/Statocles/Document),
which allows for fun things when generating content.

Finally, some of our dependencies have been removed, since their functionality
overlapped with other dependencies (or turned out to be very easy to implement
ourselves).
