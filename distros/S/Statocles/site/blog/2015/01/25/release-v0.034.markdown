Lots of breaking changes in this release, in our ramp-up to the [beta
announcement](https://github.com/preaction/Statocles/milestones/beta).

The biggest change in this release is the new [Deploy object](/pod/Statocles/Deploy).
The deploy object handles deploying the site to a folder or a Git repository. Future
possibilities include rsync or FTP, or any command at all.

*NOTE:* This change breaks your site.yml file, so please read [the config help
file](/pod/Statocles/Help/Config) to fix it.

Some major theme changes were also added, and a new default theme (using [the
Skeleton CSS library](http://getskeleton.com)) was added, removing the need for
Bootstrap (too big) from a CDN.

The theme is now always deployed with the site, always taking the `/theme` URL
path. This allows you to add extra files, CSS, JavaScript, and otherwise, to your
theme.

The template variables were cleaned up to remove a lot of hashrefs and arrayrefs in favor
of methods and objects, giving us some type checking and cleaner template code.

There are now generic `data` attributes on the Site and App objects so you can add
any random data you want that can then be used in the templates. Expect upcoming
themes to make good use of this feature!

Full changelog continues below.
