title: Release v0.035

Almost ready for the beta announcement now! Only [a few issues remain before we
can announce beta](https://github.com/preaction/Statocles/milestones/beta).

Content is now always processed through the template parser. This lets us have
includes in the content, so we can have widget templates or plugins that generate
related posts for example. This is a new feature, so I'm excited to see what can
be done with it.

There was some cleanup on the URLs we generate: Directories are being preferred
to files, so that the URLs are a bit easier to read. `/blog/page-2.html` is now
`/blog/page/2`, and `/blog/tag/mytag/page-2.html` is now
`/blog/tag/mytag/page/2`

A new help file was added, [all about deploying
Statocles](/pod/Statocles/Help/Deploy). As part of that, a lot of defaults were
updated to be more intuitive: The build directory gets automatically created, and the
default build directory is set to `.statocles-build`.

A bunch of things were fixed for Windows development, along with a nasty
platform difference in `strftime()`.

The `bundle theme` command is now actually useful and allows you to specify
where you want the theme to be copied. So now, if you want to customize the
default theme, you can `statocles bundle theme default mytheme` to copy the
default theme to the `mytheme` directory.
