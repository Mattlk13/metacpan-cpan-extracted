In this release:

## Added

* Added "blank" layout templates to the default and bootstrap themes.
  These templates have no adornment whatsoever, and are ideal for things
  like slide decks and pop-up windows.
* Added 'diagram' plugin to generate diagrams from Mermaid, a JS-based
  diagram system (https://mermaidjs.github.io/). Thanks
