In this release:

## Added

* Blog posts now have "Older" and "Newer" links so a reader can read
  a blog from start to finish, navigating through blog posts without
  having to return to the index page. Thanks

  [Github #517](https://github.com/preaction/Statocles/issues/517)

  This is a theme change, so you will need to update your theme to see
  the older/newer links. See [blog/post.html.ep in the Statocles default
  theme](https://v1.metacpan.org/source/PREACTION/Statocles-0.081/share/theme/default/blog/post.html.ep#L39-68)
  for an example.
