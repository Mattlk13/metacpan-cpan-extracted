title: Statocles Initial Public (alpha) Release
---

Though Statocles has been on CPAN for months, this is the first time I'm announcing its
availability to the world!

Statocles is a CMS for building static HTML websites. The goals of this app are to make
it easy to edit content via any text editor [1].

This initial release includes:

* A blog app
* Plain pages, for things like About Us and Contact Us
* A POD renderer for documentation of Perl projects

This site is generated with Statocles, and so is [my blog](http://preaction.me).

## Getting Started

[Get Statocles from CPAN](http://metacpan.org/pod/Statocles) and [follow the Statocles
Setup guide](/pod/Statocles/Help/Setup). If you have any issues, report them on
[the Statocles Githup Repo](https://github.com/preaction/Statocles). If you have questions,
[join us on IRC on irc.perl.org #statocles](https://chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23statocles&server=irc.perl.org)!

[1]: A future project will make Statocles content editable with a web interface
