A couple of quick fixes to the tests to ensure successful installation.

In this release:

## Fixed

* Fixed test failure with misspelled module name. Thanks
  [@mohawk2](http://github.com/mohawk2)! [[Github
  #560](http://github.com/preaction/Statocles/issues/560)]
* Increased requirement on Test::Exception to hopefully stop some test
  failures.
