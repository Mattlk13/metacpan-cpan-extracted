FUNCTIONS
  detect_scriptx_script
    Usage:

     detect_scriptx_script(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Detect whether a file is a ScriptX-based CLI script.

    The criteria are:

    *   the file must exist and readable;

    *   (optional, if "include_noexec" is false) file must have its
        executable mode bit set;

    *   content must start with a shebang "#!";

    *   either: must be perl script (shebang line contains 'perl') and must
        contain something like "use ScriptX";

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename => *str*

        Path to file to be checked.

    *   include_noexec => *bool* (default: 1)

        Include scripts that do not have +x mode bit set.

    *   string => *buf*

        String to be checked.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
