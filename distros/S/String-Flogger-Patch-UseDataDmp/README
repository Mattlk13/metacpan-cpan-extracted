SYNOPSIS

     % PERL5OPT=-MString::Flogger::Patch::UseDataDmp dzil build -v

DESCRIPTION

    I use this patch module when debugging building with Dist::Zilla
    (dzil). By default, dzil uses Log::Dispatchouli which in turn uses
    String::Flogger which in turn uses JSON to dump references, with all
    its limitations. This patch improves the dumping to see data structures
    more clearly (objects, coderefs, etc).
