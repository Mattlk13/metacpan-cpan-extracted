DEPENDENCIES

This module requires JSON and URI, and uses the tool /usr/bin/curl
to perform the actual API operation. You will also need an API key
from the abusedb website.

The example program shows the combination of PMilter and this
module to reduce spam to your inbox by throwing away mail coming
from IP addresses reported with poor reputation in the past 30 days.
This may be combined with other milters or the example program can
easily be expanded into something more elaborate.
