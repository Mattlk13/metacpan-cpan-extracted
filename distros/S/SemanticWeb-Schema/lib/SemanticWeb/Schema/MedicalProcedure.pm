palliative capacity that relies on invasive (surgical), non-invasive, or
other techniques.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

C<bodyLocation>

Location in the body of the anatomical structure.

A body_location should be one of the following types:

=head2 C<indication>

A factor that indicates use of this therapy for treatment and/or prevention
of a condition, symptom, etc. For therapies such as drugs, indications can
include both officially-approved indications as well as off-label uses.
These can be distinguished by using the ApprovedIndication subtype of
MedicalIndication.

A indication should be one of the following types:

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<preparation>

Typical preparation that a patient must undergo before having the procedure
performed.

A preparation should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalEntity']>

=head2 C<procedure_type>

C<procedureType>

The type of procedure, for example Surgical, Noninvasive, or Percutaneous.

A procedure_type should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalProcedureType']>

=back

=head2 C<status>

The status of the study (enumerated).

A status should be one of the following types:
