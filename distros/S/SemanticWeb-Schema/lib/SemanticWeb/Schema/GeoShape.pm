=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::GeoShape - The geographic shape of a place

=head1 VERSION

version v9.0.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The geographic shape of a place. A GeoShape can be described using several
properties whose values are based on latitude/longitude pairs. Either
whitespace or commas can be used to separate latitude and longitude;
whitespace should be used when writing a list of several such points.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<address>

Physical address of the item.

A address should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::PostalAddress']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_address>

A predicate for the L</address> attribute.

=head2 C<address_country>

C<addressCountry>

=for html <p>The country. For example, USA. You can also provide the two-letter <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country
code</a>.<p>

A address_country should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Country']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_address_country>

A predicate for the L</address_country> attribute.

=head2 C<box>

A box is the area enclosed by the rectangle formed by two points. The first
point is the lower corner, the second point is the upper corner. A box is
expressed as two points separated by a space character.

A box should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_box>

A predicate for the L</box> attribute.

=head2 C<circle>

A circle is the circular region of a specified radius centered at a
specified latitude and longitude. A circle is expressed as a pair followed
by a radius in meters.

A circle should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_circle>

A predicate for the L</circle> attribute.

=head2 C<elevation>

=for html <p>The elevation of a location (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS 84</a>).
Values may be of the form 'NUMBER UNIT<em>OF</em>MEASUREMENT' (e.g., '1,000
m', '3,200 ft') while numbers alone should be assumed to be a value in
meters.<p>

A elevation should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Num>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_elevation>

A predicate for the L</elevation> attribute.

=head2 C<line>

A line is a point-to-point path consisting of two or more points. A line is
expressed as a series of two or more point objects separated by space.

A line should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_line>

A predicate for the L</line> attribute.

=head2 C<polygon>

A polygon is the area enclosed by a point-to-point path for which the
starting and ending points are the same. A polygon is expressed as a series
of four or more space delimited points where the first and final points are
identical.

A polygon should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_polygon>

A predicate for the L</polygon> attribute.

=head2 C<postal_code>

C<postalCode>

The postal code. For example, 94043.

A postal_code should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_postal_code>

A predicate for the L</postal_code> attribute.
