=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::Thing - The most generic type of item.

=head1 VERSION

version v5.0.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The most generic type of item.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<additional_type>

C<additionalType>

An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a
relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa
syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute
- for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding
of extra types, in particular those defined externally.

A additional_type should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<alternate_name>

C<alternateName>

An alias for the item.

A alternate_name should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<description>

A description of the item.

A description should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<disambiguating_description>

C<disambiguatingDescription>

A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to
disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties
(in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for
disambiguation.

A disambiguating_description should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<identifier>

=for html <p>The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind
of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>, such as
ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for
representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI)
links. See <a href="/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg">background notes</a>
for more details.<p>

A identifier should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::PropertyValue']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<image>

=for html <p>An image of the item. This can be a <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/URL">URL</a> or a fully described <a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/ImageObject">ImageObject</a>.<p>

A image should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ImageObject']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<main_entity_of_page>

C<mainEntityOfPage>

=for html <p>Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the
main entity being described. See <a
href="/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground">background notes</a> for
details.<p>

A main_entity_of_page should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::CreativeWork']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<name>

The name of the item.

A name should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<potential_action>

C<potentialAction>

Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which
this thing would play an 'object' role.

A potential_action should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Action']>

=back

=head2 C<same_as>

C<sameAs>

URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's
identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or
official website.

A same_as should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<subject_of>

C<subjectOf>

A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.

A subject_of should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::CreativeWork']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Event']>

=back

=head2 C<url>

URL of the item.

A url should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back
