A predicate for the L</bed> attribute.

=head2 C<occupancy>

infants etc). For individual accommodations, this is not necessarily the
legal maximum but defines the permitted usage as per the contractual
agreement (e.g. a double room used by a single person). Typical unit
code(s): C62 for person

A occupancy should be one of the following types:
