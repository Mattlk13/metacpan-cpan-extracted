=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue - A predefined value for a product characteristic

=head1 VERSION

version v3.9.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A predefined value for a product characteristic, e.g. the power cord plug
type 'US' or the garment sizes 'S', 'M', 'L', and 'XL'.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<additional_property>

C<additionalProperty>

=for html A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the
entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there
is no matching property in schema.org.<br/><br/> Note: Publishers should be
aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties
(e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color,
http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be
provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
property/value mechanism.

A additional_property should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::PropertyValue']>

=back

=head2 C<equal>

This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is
equal to the object.

A equal should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<greater>

This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is
greater than the object.

A greater should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<greater_or_equal>

C<greaterOrEqual>

This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is
greater than or equal to the object.

A greater_or_equal should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<lesser>

This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is
lesser than the object.

A lesser should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<lesser_or_equal>

C<lesserOrEqual>

This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is
lesser than or equal to the object.

A lesser_or_equal should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<non_equal>

C<nonEqual>

This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is
not equal to the object.

A non_equal should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<value_reference>

C<valueReference>

A pointer to a secondary value that provides additional information on the
original value, e.g. a reference temperature.

A value_reference should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Enumeration']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::PropertyValue']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QualitativeValue']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QuantitativeValue']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::StructuredValue']>
