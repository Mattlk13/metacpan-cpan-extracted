=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalCondition - Any condition of the human body that affects the normal functioning of a person

=head1 VERSION

version v3.9.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any condition of the human body that affects the normal functioning of a
person, whether physically or mentally. Includes diseases, injuries,
disabilities, disorders, syndromes, etc.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<associated_anatomy>

C<associatedAnatomy>

The anatomy of the underlying organ system or structures associated with
this entity.

A associated_anatomy should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalStructure']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalSystem']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::SuperficialAnatomy']>

=back

=head2 C<cause>

Specifying a cause of something in general. e.g in medicine , one of the
causative agent(s) that are most directly responsible for the
pathophysiologic process that eventually results in the occurrence.

A cause should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalCause']>

=back

=head2 C<differential_diagnosis>

C<differentialDiagnosis>

One of a set of differential diagnoses for the condition. Specifically, a
closely-related or competing diagnosis typically considered later in the
cognitive process whereby this medical condition is distinguished from
others most likely responsible for a similar collection of signs and
symptoms to reach the most parsimonious diagnosis or diagnoses in a
patient.

A differential_diagnosis should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::DDxElement']>

=back

=head2 C<drug>

Specifying a drug or medicine used in a medication procedure

A drug should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Drug']>

=back

=head2 C<epidemiology>

The characteristics of associated patients, such as age, gender, race etc.

A epidemiology should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<expected_prognosis>

C<expectedPrognosis>

The likely outcome in either the short term or long term of the medical
condition.

A expected_prognosis should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<natural_progression>

C<naturalProgression>

The expected progression of the condition if it is not treated and allowed
to progress naturally.

A natural_progression should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<pathophysiology>

Changes in the normal mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions that
are associated with this activity or condition.

A pathophysiology should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<possible_complication>

C<possibleComplication>

A possible unexpected and unfavorable evolution of a medical condition.
Complications may include worsening of the signs or symptoms of the
disease, extension of the condition to other organ systems, etc.

A possible_complication should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<possible_treatment>

C<possibleTreatment>

A possible treatment to address this condition, sign or symptom.

A possible_treatment should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalTherapy']>

=back

=head2 C<primary_prevention>

C<primaryPrevention>

A preventative therapy used to prevent an initial occurrence of the medical
condition, such as vaccination.

A primary_prevention should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalTherapy']>

=back

=head2 C<risk_factor>

C<riskFactor>

A modifiable or non-modifiable factor that increases the risk of a patient
contracting this condition, e.g. age, coexisting condition.

A risk_factor should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalRiskFactor']>

=back

=head2 C<secondary_prevention>

C<secondaryPrevention>

A preventative therapy used to prevent reoccurrence of the medical
condition after an initial episode of the condition.

A secondary_prevention should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalTherapy']>

=back

=head2 C<sign_or_symptom>

C<signOrSymptom>

A sign or symptom of this condition. Signs are objective or physically
observable manifestations of the medical condition while symptoms are the
subjective experience of the medical condition.

A sign_or_symptom should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalSignOrSymptom']>

=back

=head2 C<stage>

The stage of the condition, if applicable.

A stage should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalConditionStage']>

=back

=head2 C<status>

The status of the study (enumerated).

A status should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::EventStatusType']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalStudyStatus']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<subtype>

A more specific type of the condition, where applicable, for example 'Type
1 Diabetes', 'Type 2 Diabetes', or 'Gestational Diabetes' for Diabetes.

A subtype should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<typical_test>

C<typicalTest>

A medical test typically performed given this condition.

A typical_test should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalTest']>

=back
