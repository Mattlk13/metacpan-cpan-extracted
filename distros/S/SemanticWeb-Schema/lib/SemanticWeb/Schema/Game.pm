C<characterAttribute>

A piece of data that represents a particular aspect of a fictional
character (skill, power, character points, advantage, disadvantage).

A character_attribute should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Thing']>

=back

=head2 C<game_item>

C<gameItem>

An item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a
player or, occasionally, a non-player character.

A game_item should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Thing']>

=back

=head2 C<game_location>

C<gameLocation>

Real or fictional location of the game (or part of game).

A game_location should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Place']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::PostalAddress']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<number_of_players>

C<numberOfPlayers>

Indicate how many people can play this game (minimum, maximum, or range).

A number_of_players should be one of the following types:

=over

=back

=head2 C<quest>

The task that a player-controlled character, or group of characters may
complete in order to gain a reward.
