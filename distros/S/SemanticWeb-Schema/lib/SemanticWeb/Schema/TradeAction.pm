=head2 C<price>

=for html The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to
PriceSpecification and its subtypes.<br/><br/> Usage guidelines:<br/><br/>
<ul> <li>Use the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/priceCurrency">priceCurrency</a> property (with
standard formats: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217
currency format</a> e.g. "USD"; <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">Ticker
symbol</a> for cryptocurrencies e.g. "BTC"; well known names for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system">Local
Exchange Tradings Systems</a> (LETS) and other currency types e.g. "Ithaca
HOUR") instead of including <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_doll
ar_or_peso_sign">ambiguous symbols</a> such as '$' in the value.</li>
<li>Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a
decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.</li>
<li>Note that both <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute">
RDFa</a> and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for
publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly
formatting.</li> <li>Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO'
(U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar
Unicode symbols.</li> </ul>
