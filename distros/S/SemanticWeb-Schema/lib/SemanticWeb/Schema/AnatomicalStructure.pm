=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalStructure - Any part of the human body

=head1 VERSION

version v5.0.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any part of the human body, typically a component of an anatomical system.
Organs, tissues, and cells are all anatomical structures.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<associated_pathophysiology>

C<associatedPathophysiology>

If applicable, a description of the pathophysiology associated with the
anatomical system, including potential abnormal changes in the mechanical,
physical, and biochemical functions of the system.

A associated_pathophysiology should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<body_location>

C<bodyLocation>

Location in the body of the anatomical structure.

A body_location should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<connected_to>

C<connectedTo>

Other anatomical structures to which this structure is connected.

A connected_to should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalStructure']>

=back

=head2 C<diagram>

An image containing a diagram that illustrates the structure and/or its
component substructures and/or connections with other structures.

A diagram should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ImageObject']>

=back

=head2 C<function>

Function of the anatomical structure.

A function should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<part_of_system>

C<partOfSystem>

The anatomical or organ system that this structure is part of.

A part_of_system should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalSystem']>

=back

=head2 C<related_condition>

C<relatedCondition>

A medical condition associated with this anatomy.

A related_condition should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalCondition']>

=back

=head2 C<related_therapy>

C<relatedTherapy>

A medical therapy related to this anatomy.

A related_therapy should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalTherapy']>

=back

=head2 C<sub_structure>

C<subStructure>

Component (sub-)structure(s) that comprise this anatomical structure.

A sub_structure should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalStructure']>

=back
