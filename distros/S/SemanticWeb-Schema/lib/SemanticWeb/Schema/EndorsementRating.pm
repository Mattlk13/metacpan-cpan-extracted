version v7.0.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for html <p>An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of
endorsement, for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a "Like" or
"+1" on a social network. It can be considered the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/result">result</a> of an <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/EndorseAction">EndorseAction</a> in which the <a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/object">object</a> of the action
is rated positively by some <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/agent">agent</a>. As is common elsewhere in
schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an
action without explicitly describing the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/Action">Action</a>.<br/><br/> An <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/EndorsementRating">EndorsementRating</a> may be
part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required:
having an explicit type for indicating a positive, endorsement rating is
particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers
understand that the rating is broadly positive.<p>
