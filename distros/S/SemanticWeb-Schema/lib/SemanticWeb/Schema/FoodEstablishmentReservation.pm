=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::FoodEstablishmentReservation - A reservation to dine at a food-related business

=head1 VERSION

version v3.5.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for html A reservation to dine at a food-related business.<br/><br/> Note: This type
is for information about actual reservations, e.g. in confirmation emails
or HTML pages with individual confirmations of reservations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<end_time>

C<endTime>

=for html The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g.
FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For
actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g.
John wrote a book from January to <em>December</em>. For media, including
audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger
file.<br/><br/> Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of
startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation
may be clarified in future revisions.

A end_time should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<party_size>
