=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_significant_links>

A predicate for the L</significant_links> attribute.

=head2 C<speakable>

=for html <p>Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in
the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for
text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully
spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to
indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.<br/><br/>
The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of
times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/> 1.)
<em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in
the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has
(potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the
document concerned.<br/><br/> 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the
annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>
3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the
content). Use the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/> For more
sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references,
either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s)
as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a>
which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em>
property.<p>

A speakable should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::SpeakableSpecification']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_speakable>

A predicate for the L</speakable> attribute.

=head2 C<specialty>

A specialty should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Specialty']>

=back
