=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::PriceSpecification - A structured value representing a price or price range

=head1 VERSION

version v7.0.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for html <p>A structured value representing a price or price range. Typically, only
the subclasses of this type are used for markup. It is recommended to use
<a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/MonetaryAmount">MonetaryAmount</a> to describe
independent amounts of money such as a salary, credit card limits, etc.<p>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<eligible_quantity>

C<eligibleQuantity>

The interval and unit of measurement of ordering quantities for which the
offer or price specification is valid. This allows e.g. specifying that a
certain freight charge is valid only for a certain quantity.

A eligible_quantity should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::QuantitativeValue']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_eligible_quantity>

A predicate for the L</eligible_quantity> attribute.

=head2 C<eligible_transaction_volume>

C<eligibleTransactionVolume>

The transaction volume, in a monetary unit, for which the offer or price
specification is valid, e.g. for indicating a minimal purchasing volume, to
express free shipping above a certain order volume, or to limit the
acceptance of credit cards to purchases to a certain minimal amount.

A eligible_transaction_volume should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::PriceSpecification']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_eligible_transaction_volume>

A predicate for the L</eligible_transaction_volume> attribute.

=head2 C<max_price>

C<maxPrice>

The highest price if the price is a range.

A max_price should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Num>

=back

=head2 C<_has_max_price>

A predicate for the L</max_price> attribute.

=head2 C<min_price>

C<minPrice>

The lowest price if the price is a range.

A min_price should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Num>

=back

=head2 C<_has_min_price>

A predicate for the L</min_price> attribute.

=head2 C<price>

=for html <p>The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to
PriceSpecification and its subtypes.<br/><br/> Usage guidelines:<br/><br/>
<ul> <li>Use the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/priceCurrency">priceCurrency</a> property (with
standard formats: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217
currency format</a> e.g. "USD"; <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">Ticker
symbol</a> for cryptocurrencies e.g. "BTC"; well known names for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system">Local
Exchange Tradings Systems</a> (LETS) and other currency types e.g. "Ithaca
HOUR") instead of including <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_doll
ar_or_peso_sign">ambiguous symbols</a> such as '$' in the value.</li>
<li>Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a
decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.</li>
<li>Note that both <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute">
RDFa</a> and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for
publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly
formatting.</li> <li>Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO'
(U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar
Unicode symbols.</li> </ul> <p>

A price should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Num>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_price>

A predicate for the L</price> attribute.

=head2 C<price_currency>

C<priceCurrency>

=for html <p>The currency of the price, or a price component when attached to <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/PriceSpecification">PriceSpecification</a> and its
subtypes.<br/><br/> Use standard formats: <a

e.g. "USD"; <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">Ticker
symbol</a> for cryptocurrencies e.g. "BTC"; well known names for <a

HOUR".<p>

A price_currency should be one of the following types:

=back

=head2 C<_has_valid_from>

A predicate for the L</valid_from> attribute.

=head2 C<valid_through>

The date after when the item is not valid. For example the end of an offer,
salary period, or a period of opening hours.

A valid_through should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_valid_through>

A predicate for the L</valid_through> attribute.

=head2 C<value_added_tax_included>
