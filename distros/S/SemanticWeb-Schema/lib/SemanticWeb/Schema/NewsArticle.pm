=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::NewsArticle - A NewsArticle is an article whose content reports news

=head1 VERSION

version v0.0.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for html A NewsArticle is an article whose content reports news, or provides
background context and supporting materials for understanding the
news.<br/><br/> A more detailed overview of <a
href="/docs/news.html">schema.org News markup</a> is also available.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<dateline>

=for html A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline">dateline</a> is a brief
piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the
story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only
a placename is provided.<br/><br/> Structured representations of
dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/locationCreated">locationCreated</a> (which
represents where a work was created e.g. where a news report was written).
For location depicted or described in the content, use <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/contentLocation">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>
Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards
automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: "BEIRUT,
Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting
from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines".
