=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::SoftwareSourceCode - Computer programming source code

=head1 VERSION

version v4.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Computer programming source code. Example: Full (compile ready) solutions,
code snippet samples, scripts, templates.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<code_repository>

C<codeRepository>

Link to the repository where the un-compiled, human readable code and
related code is located (SVN, github, CodePlex).

A code_repository should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<code_sample_type>

C<codeSampleType>

What type of code sample: full (compile ready) solution, code snippet,
inline code, scripts, template.

A code_sample_type should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<programming_language>

C<programmingLanguage>

The computer programming language.

A programming_language should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ComputerLanguage']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<runtime>

Runtime platform or script interpreter dependencies (Example - Java v1,
Python2.3, .Net Framework 3.0).

A runtime should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<runtime_platform>

C<runtimePlatform>

Runtime platform or script interpreter dependencies (Example - Java v1,
Python2.3, .Net Framework 3.0).

A runtime_platform should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<sample_type>

inline code, scripts, template.

A sample_type should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<target_product>

C<targetProduct>

Target Operating System / Product to which the code applies. If applies to
several versions, just the product name can be used.

A target_product should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::SoftwareApplication']>
