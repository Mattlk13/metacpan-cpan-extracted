=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::Nerve - A common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons.

=head1 VERSION

version v3.9.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are
transmitted along each of the axons.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<branch>

=for html The branches that delineate from the nerve bundle. Not to be confused with
<a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/branchOf">branchOf</a>.

A branch should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalStructure']>

=back

=head2 C<nerve_motor>

C<nerveMotor>

The neurological pathway extension that involves muscle control.

A nerve_motor should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Muscle']>

=back

=head2 C<sensory_unit>

C<sensoryUnit>

The neurological pathway extension that inputs and sends information to the
brain or spinal cord.

A sensory_unit should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AnatomicalStructure']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::SuperficialAnatomy']>

=back

=head2 C<sourced_from>

C<sourcedFrom>

The neurological pathway that originates the neurons.

A sourced_from should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::BrainStructure']>
