=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::MedicalStudy - A medical study is an umbrella type covering all kinds of research studies relating to human medicine or health

=head1 VERSION

version v5.0.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A medical study is an umbrella type covering all kinds of research studies
relating to human medicine or health, including observational studies and
interventional trials and registries, randomized, controlled or not. When
the specific type of study is known, use one of the extensions of this
type, such as MedicalTrial or MedicalObservationalStudy. Also, note that
this type should be used to mark up data that describes the study itself;
to tag an article that publishes the results of a study, use
MedicalScholarlyArticle. Note: use the code property of MedicalEntity to
store study IDs, e.g. clinicaltrials.gov ID.
