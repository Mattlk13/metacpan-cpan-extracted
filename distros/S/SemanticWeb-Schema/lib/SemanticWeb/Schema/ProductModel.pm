=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::ProductModel - A datasheet or vendor specification of a product (in the sense of a prototypical description).

=head1 VERSION

version v0.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A datasheet or vendor specification of a product (in the sense of a
prototypical description).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<is_variant_of>

C<isVariantOf>

A pointer to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is
safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base
model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive.

A is_variant_of should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ProductModel']>

=back

=head2 C<predecessor_of>

C<predecessorOf>

A pointer from a previous, often discontinued variant of the product to its
newer variant.

A predecessor_of should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ProductModel']>

=back

=head2 C<successor_of>

C<successorOf>

A pointer from a newer variant of a product to its previous, often
discontinued predecessor.

A successor_of should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ProductModel']>

=back
