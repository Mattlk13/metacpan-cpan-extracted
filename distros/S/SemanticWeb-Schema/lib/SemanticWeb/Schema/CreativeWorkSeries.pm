=head1 NAME

SemanticWeb::Schema::CreativeWorkSeries - A CreativeWorkSeries in schema

=head1 VERSION

version v7.0.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for html <p>A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items,
typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are
usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/ItemList">ItemList</a> which is a
general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with
CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and
periodicals, or media such as tv, radio and games).<br/><br/> Specific
subtypes are available for describing <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/TVSeries">TVSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/RadioSeries">RadioSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/MovieSeries">MovieSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/BookSeries">BookSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/Periodical">Periodical</a> and <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/VideoGameSeries">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case,
the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/hasPart">hasPart</a> / <a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/isPartOf">isPartOf</a> properties
can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general
CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific
and practical subtypes.<br/><br/> It is common for properties applicable to
an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group.
Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers
should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a
whole wherever they seem appropriate.<p>
