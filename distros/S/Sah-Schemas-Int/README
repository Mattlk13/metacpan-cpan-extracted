SAH SCHEMAS
    *   byte

        Same as uint8.

    *   even

        Even number.

    *   int128

        128-bit signed integer.

    *   int16

        16-bit signed integer.

    *   int32

        32-bit signed integer.

    *   int64

        64-bit signed integer.

    *   int8

        8-bit signed integer.

    *   natnum

        Same as posint.

        Natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering. Some
        definitions, like ISO 80000-2 begin the natural numbers with 0. But
        in this definition, natural numbers start with 1. For integers that
        start at 0, see "uint".

    *   negeven

        Negative even number.

    *   negint

        Negative integer (-1, -2, ...).

    *   negodd

        Negative odd number.

    *   nonnegint

        Non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...) [DEPRECATED].

        This schema is DEPRECATED. Please use the new name "uint".

        See also "posint" for integers that start from 1.

    *   odd

        Odd number.

    *   poseven

        Positive even number.

    *   posint

        Positive integer (1, 2, ...).

        Zero is not included in this schema because zero is neither positive
        nor negative. See also "uint" for integers that start from 0.

    *   posodd

        Positive odd number.

    *   uint

        Non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).

        See also "posint" for integers that start from 1.

    *   uint128

        128-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint16

        16-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint32

        32-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint64

        64-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint8

        8-bit unsigned integer.
