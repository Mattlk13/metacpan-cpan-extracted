NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Int - Sah schemas for various integers

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.077 of Sah::Schemas::Int (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Int), released on 2022-10-19.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   byte

        Same as uint8.

    *   even

        Even number.

    *   int128

        128-bit signed integer.

    *   int16

        16-bit signed integer.

    *   int32

        32-bit signed integer.

    *   int64

        64-bit signed integer.

    *   int8

        8-bit signed integer.

    *   natnum

        Same as posint.

        Natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering. Some
        definitions, like ISO 80000-2 begin the natural numbers with 0. But
        in this definition, natural numbers start with 1. For integers that
        start at 0, see "uint".

    *   negeven

        Negative even number.

    *   negint

        Negative integer (-1, -2, ...).

    *   negodd

        Negative odd number.

    *   nonnegint

        Non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), same as uint.

    *   nonposint

        Non-positive integer (0, -1, -2, ...).

    *   odd

        Odd number.

    *   poseven

        Positive even number.

    *   posint

        Positive integer (1, 2, ...).

        Zero is not included in this schema because zero is neither positive
        nor negative. See also "uint" for integers that start from 0.

    *   posodd

        Positive odd number.

    *   uint

        Non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).

        See also "posint" for integers that start from 1.

    *   uint128

        128-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint16

        16-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint32

        32-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint64

        64-bit unsigned integer.

    *   uint8

        8-bit unsigned integer.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
