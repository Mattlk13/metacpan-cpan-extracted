To merely try this software, there is no need to install anything.
The utilities in bin/ may be run from their location.

To generate Makefile and test the package, run from command line:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test

To install the package (probably as root), run:

	% make install

The default installation directories are usually /usr/local/bin
for utilities and /usr/local/share/perl5 for perl modules.
To change them, specify parameters on the "make install" step
(see "perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker") or on the first step, like:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/tmp/myroot

In this case the installation directories will be:
/tmp/myroot/bin for utilities,
/tmp/myroot/share/man/man3 for man pages and
/tmp/myroot/share/perl5 for perl modules.

Good luck.
