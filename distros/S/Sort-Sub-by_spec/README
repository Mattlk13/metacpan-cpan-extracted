NAME
    Sort::Sub::by_spec - Sort by spec

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Sort::Sub::by_spec (from Perl
    distribution Sort-Sub-by_spec), released on 2023-10-23.

SYNOPSIS
    Generate sorter (accessed as variable) via Sort::Sub import:

     use Sort::Sub '$by_spec'; # use '$by_spec<i>' for case-insensitive sorting, '$by_spec<r>' for reverse sorting
     my @sorted = sort $by_spec ('item', ...);

    Generate sorter (accessed as subroutine):

     use Sort::Sub 'by_spec<ir>';
     my @sorted = sort {by_spec} ('item', ...);

    Generate directly without Sort::Sub:

     use Sort::Sub::by_spec;
     my $sorter = Sort::Sub::by_spec::gen_sorter(
         ci => 1,      # default 0, set 1 to sort case-insensitively
         reverse => 1, # default 0, set 1 to sort in reverse order
     );
     my @sorted = sort $sorter ('item', ...);

    Use in shell/CLI with sortsub (from App::sortsub):

     % some-cmd | sortsub by_spec
     % some-cmd | sortsub by_spec --ignore-case -r

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
