=head1 NAME

String::Print - printf alternative

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ### Functional interface
 use String::Print qw/printi printp/, %config;
 
 # interpolation of arrays and hashes
 printi 'age {years}', years => 12;
 printi 'price-list: {prices%.2f}', prices => \@prices, _join => "+";
 printi 'dump: {c}', c => \%config;
 
 # [0.90] more complex interpolation names
 printi 'filename: {c.filename}', c => \%config;
 printi 'username: {user.name}', user => $user_object;
 printi 'price: {product.price €}', product => $db->product(3);
 
 # same with positional parameters
 printp 'age %d", 12;
 printp 'price-list: %.2f', \@prices;
 printp 'dump: %s', \%settings;
 
 ### Object Oriented interface
 use String::Print 'oo';      # import nothing 
 my $f = String::Print->new(%config);
 $f->printi('age {years}', years => 12);
 $f->printp('age %d', 12);
 
 ### via Log::Report's __* functions
 use Log::Report::Optional;
 print __x"age {years}", years => 12;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module inserts values into (translated) strings.  It provides
C<printf> and C<sprintf> alternatives via both an object oriented and a
functional interface.

Read in the L</DETAILS> chapter below, why this module provides a better
alternative for C<printf()>.  Also, some extended B<examples> can be
found there.  Take a look at them first, when you start using this
module!

=head1 METHODS

=head2 The Object Oriented interface

See functions L<printi()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS">, L<sprinti()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS">, L<printp()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS">, and L<sprintp()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS">: you
can also call them as method.

 use String::Print 'oo';
 my $f = String::Print->new(%config);
 $f->printi($format, @params);
 
 # exactly the same functionality:
 use String::Print 'printi', %config;
 printi $format, @params;

The Object Oriented interface wins when you need the same configuration
in multiple source files, or when you need different configurations
within one program.  In these cases, the hassle of explicitly using the
object has some benefits.

=head3 Constructors

=over 4

=item String::Print-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

 -Option     --Default
  encode_for   undef
  modifiers    [ qr/^%\S+/ = \&format_printf]>
  serializers  <useful defaults>

=over 2

=item encode_for => HASH|'HTML'

[0.90] The format string and the inserted values will get encoded according to
some syntax rules.  For instance, C<encode_entities()> of HTML::Entities
when you specify the predefined string C<HTML>.  See L<encodeFor()|String::Print/"Attributes">.

=item modifiers => ARRAY

Add one or more modifier handlers to power of the formatter.  They will
get preference over the predefined modifiers, but lower than the modifiers
passed to C<print[ip]> itself.

=item serializers => HASH|ARRAY

How to serialize data elements.

=back

example: 

  my $f = String::Print->new
    ( modifiers   => [ EUR   => sub {sprintf "%5.2f e", $_[0]} ]
    , serializers => [ UNDEF => sub {'-'} ]
    , encode_for  => 'HTML'
    );

  $f->printi("price: {p EUR}", p => 3.1415); # price: ␣␣3.14 e
  $f->printi("count: {c}", c => undef);      # count: -

=back

=head3 Attributes

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addModifiers>(PAIRS)

The PAIRS are a combination of an selector and a CODE which processes the
value when the modifier matches.  The selector is a string or (preferred)
a regular expression. Later modifiers with the same name overrule earlier
definitions.  You may also specify an ARRAY of modifiers per C<print>.

See section L</"Interpolation: Modifiers"> about the details.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<encodeFor>(HASH|undef|($predefined, %overrule))

[0.90] Enable/define the output encoding.
Read section L</"Output encoding"> about the details.

=back

=head3 Printing

The following are provided as method and as function.  You find their
explanation further down on this page.

$obj->B<printi>([$fh], $format, PAIRS|HASH);

$obj->B<printp>([$fh], $format, PAIRS|HASH);

$obj->B<sprinti>($format, PAIRS|HASH);

$obj->B<sprintp>($format, LIST, PAIRS);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The functional interface creates a hidden object.  You may import any of
these functions explicitly, or all together by not specifying the names.

B<. Example>

  use String::Print;           # all
  use String::Print 'sprinti'; # only sprinti

  use String::Print 'printi'   # only printi
    , modifiers   => [ EUR   => sub {sprintf "%5.2f e", $_[0]} ]
    , serializers => [ UNDEF => sub {'-'} ];

  printi "price: {p EUR}", p => 3.1415; # price: ␣␣3.14 e
  printi "count: {c}", c => undef;      # count: -

=over 4

=item B<printi>( [$fh], $format, PAIRS|HASH )

Calls L<sprinti()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> to fill the data in PAIRS or HASH in $format, and
then sends it to the $fh (by default the selected file)

  open my $fh, '>', $file;
  printi $fh, ...

  printi \*STDERR, ...

=item B<printp>( [$fh], $format, PAIRS|HASH )

Calls L<sprintp()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> to fill the data in PAIRS or HASH in $format, and
then sends it to the $fh (by default the selected file)

=item B<sprinti>($format, PAIRS|HASH)

The $format refers to some string, maybe the result of a translation.

The PAIRS (which may be passed as LIST or HASH) contains a mixture of
special and normal variables to be filled in.  The names of the special
variables (the options) start with an underscore (C<_>).

 -Option  --Default
  _append   undef
  _count    undef
  _join     ', '
  _prepend  undef

=over 2

=item _append => STRING|OBJECT

Text as STRING appended after $format, without interpolation.

=item _count => INTEGER

Result of the translation process: when Log::Report subroutine __xn is
are used for count-sensitive translation.  Those function may add
more specials to the parameter list.

=item _join => STRING

Which STRING to use when an ARRAY is being filled-in as parameter.

=item _prepend => STRING|OBJECT

Text as STRING prepended before $format, without interpolation.  This
may also be an OBJECT which gets stringified, but variables not filled-in.

=back

=item B<sprintp>($format, LIST, PAIRS)

Where L<sprinti()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> uses named parameters --especially useful when the
strings need translation-- this function stays close to the standard
C<sprintf()>.  All features of POSIX formats are supported.  This
should say enough: you can use C<%3$0#5.*d>, if you like.

It may be useful to know that the positional $format is rewritten and
then fed into L<sprinti()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS">.  B<Be careful> with the length of the LIST:
superfluous parameter PAIRS are passed along to C<sprinti()>, and
should only contain "specials".

example: of the rewrite

  # positional parameters
  my $x = sprintp "dumpfiles: %s\n", \@dumpfiles
     , _join => ':';

  # is rewriten into, and then processed as
  my $x = sprinti "dumpfiles: {filenames}\n"
     , filenames => \@dumpfiles, _join => ':';

=back

=head1 DETAILS

=head2 Why use C<printi()>, not C<printf()>?

The C<printf()> function is provided by Perl's CORE; you do not need
to install any module to use it.  Why would you use consider using
this module?

=over 4

=item translating

C<printf()> uses positional parameters, where L<printi()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> uses names
to refer to the values to be filled-in.  Especially in a set-up with
translations, where the format strings get extracted into PO-files,
it is much clearer to use names.  This is also a disadvantage of
L<printp()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS">

=item pluggable serializers

C<printi()> supports serialization for specific data-types: how to
interpolate C<undef>, HASHes, etc.

=item pluggable modifiers

Especially useful in context of translations, the FORMAT string may
contain (language specific) helpers to insert the values correctly.

=item correct use of utf8

Sized string formatting in C<printf()> is broken: it takes your string
as bytes, not Perl strings (which may be utf8).  In unicode, one
"character" may use many bytes.  Also, some characters are displayed
double wide, for instance in Chinese.  The L<printi()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> implementation
will use Unicode::GCString for correct behavior.

=item automatic output encoding (for HTML)

You can globally declare that all produced strings must be encoded in
a certain format, for instance that HTML entities should be encoded.o

=back

=head2 Four components

To fill-in a FORMAT, four clearly separated components play a role:

=over 4

=item 1. modifiers

How to change the provided values, for instance to hide locale
differences.

=item 2. serializer

How to represent (the modified) the values correctly, for instance C<undef>
and ARRAYs.

=item 3. conversion

The standard UNIX format rules, like C<%d>.  One conversion rule
has been added 'S', which provides unicode correct behavior.

=item 4. encoding

Prepare the output for a certain syntax, like HTML.

=back

Simplified:

  # sprinti() replaces "{$key$modifiers$conversion}" by
  $encode->($format->($serializer->($modifiers->($args{$key}))))

  # sprintp() replaces "%pos{$modifiers}$conversion" by
  $encode->($format->($serializer->($modifiers->($arg[$pos]))))

Example:

  printi "price: {price € %-10s}", price => $cost;
  printi "price: {price € %-10s}", { price => $cost };
  printp "price: %-10{€}s", $cost;

  $value      = $cost (in €)
  $modifier   = convert € to local currency £
  $serializer = show float as string
  $format     = column width %-10s
  $encode     = £ into &pound;     # when encodingFor('HTML')

=head2 Interpolation: keys

A key is a bareword (like a variable name) or a list of barewords
separated by dots (no blanks!)  A simple key directly refers to a
named parameter of the function or method:

  printi "Username: {name}", name => 'Mark';

You may also pass them as HASH

  printi "Username: {name}", { name => 'Mark' };

Or as CODE:

  printi "Username: {name}", name => sub { 'Mark' };

The smartness of pre-processing CODE is part of serialization.

B<Please> use explanatory key names, to help the translation
process once you need that (in the future).

=head3 Complex keys

[0.90] In the previous section, we kept our addressing it simple: let's
change that now.  Two alternatives for the same:

  printi "Username: {name}", name => $user->{name};  # simple key
  printi "Username: {user.name}", user => $user;     # complex key

You can pass a parameter name as HASH, which contains values.  This may
even be nested into multiple levels.  You may also pass objects, class
(package names), and code references.

In above case of C<user.name>, when C<user> is a HASH it will take the
value which belongs to the key C<name>.  When C<user> is a CODE, it will
run code to get a value.  When C<user> is an object, the method C<name>
is called to get a value back.  When C<user> is a class name, the C<name>
refers to an instance method on that class.

More examples which do work:

 # when name is a column in the database query result
 printi "Username: {user.name}", user => $db->fetchrow_hashref;
 
 # call a sub which does the database query, returning a HASH
 printi "Username: {user.name}", user => sub { $db->getUser('mark') };
 
 # using an instance method (object)
 {  package User;
    sub new  { bless { myname => $_[1] }, $_[0] }
    sub name { $_[0]->{myname} }
 }
 my $user = User->new('Mark');
 printi "Username: {user.name}", user => $user;

 # using a class method
 sub User::count   { 42 }
 printi "Username: {user.count}", user => 'User';
 
 # mixed, here CODE, HASH, and Object
 printi "Username: {document.author.name}", document => sub {
    return +{ author => User->new('Mark') }
 };

Limitation: you cannot pass arguments to CODE calls.

=head2 Interpolation: Serialization

The 'interpolation' functions have named VARIABLES to be filled-in, but
also additional OPTIONS.  To distinguish between the OPTIONS and VARIABLES
(both a list of key-value pairs), the keys of the OPTIONS start with
an underscore C<_>.  As result of this, please avoid the use of keys
which start with an underscore in variable names.  On the other hand,
you are allowed to interpolate OPTION values in your strings.

There is no way of checking beforehand whether you have provided all
values to be interpolated in the translated string.  When you refer to
value which is missing, it will be interpreted as C<undef>.

=over 4

=item strings

Simple scalar values are interpolated "as is"

=item CODE

When a value is passed as CODE reference, that function will get called
to return the value to be filled in.
For interpolating, the following rules apply:

=item SCALAR

Takes the value where the scalar reference points to.

=item ARRAY

All members will be interpolated with C<,␣> between the elements.
Alternatively (maybe nicer), you can pass an interpolation parameter
via the C<_join> OPTION.

  printi "matching files: {files}", files => \@files, _join => ', '

=item HASH

By default, HASHes are interpolated with sorted keys,

   $key => $value, $key2 => $value2, ...

There is no quoting on the keys or values (yet).  Usually, this will
produce an ugly result anyway.

=item Objects

With the C<serialization> parameter, you can overrule the interpolation
of above defaults, but also add rules for your own objects.  By default,
objects get stringified.

  serialization => [ $myclass => \&name_in_reverse ]

  sub name_in_reverse($$$)
  {   my ($formatter, $object, $args) = @_;
      # the $args are all parameters to be filled-in
      scalar reverse $object->name;
  }

=back

=head2 Interpolation: Modifiers

Modifiers are used to change the value to be inserted, before the characters
get interpolated in the line.

=head3 Modifiers: unix format

Next to the name, you can specify a format code.  With (gnu) C<gettext()>,
you often see this:

 printf gettext("approx pi: %.6f\n"), PI;

Locale::TextDomain has two ways:

 printf __"approx pi: %.6f\n", PI;
 print __x"approx pi: {approx}\n", approx => sprintf("%.6f", PI);

The first does not respect the wish to be able to reorder the arguments
during translation (although there are ways to work around that)  The
second version is quite long.  The content of the translation table
differs between the examples.

With C<Log::Report>, above syntaxes do work, but you can also do:

 # with optional translations
 print __x"approx pi: {pi%.6f}\n", pi => PI;

The base for C<__x()> is the L<printi()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> provided by this module. Internally,
it will call C<printi> to fill in parameters:

 printi   "approx pi: {pi%.6f}\n", pi => PI;

Another example:

 printi "{perms} {links%2d} {user%-8s} {size%10d} {fn}\n"
   , perms => '-rw-r--r--', links => 7, user => 'me'
   , size => 12345, fn => $filename;

An additional advantage is the fact that not all languages produce
comparable length strings.  Now, the translators can take care that
the layout of tables is optimal.  Above example in L<printp()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> syntax,
shorter but less maintainable:

 printp "%s %2d %-8s 10d %s\n"
   , '-rw-r--r--', 7, 'me', 12345, $filename;

=head3 Modifiers: unix format improvements

The POSIX C<printf()> does not handle unicode strings.  Perl does
understand that the 's' modifier may need to insert utf8 so does not
count bytes but characters.  C<printi()> does not use characters but
"grapheme clusters" via Unicode::GCString.  Now, also composed
characters do work correctly.

Additionally, you can use the B<new 'S' conversion> to count in columns.
In fixed-width fonts, graphemes can have width 0, 1 or 2.  For instance,
Chinese characters have width 2.  When printing in fixed-width, this
'S' is probably the better choice over 's'.  When the field does not
specify its width, then there is no performance penalty for using 'S'.

=head3 Modifiers: private modifiers

You may pass your own modifiers.  A modifier consists of a selector and
a CODE, which is called when the selector matches.  The selector is either
a string or a regular expression.

  # in Object Oriented syntax:
  my $f = String::Print->new
    ( modifiers => [ qr/[€₤]/ => \&money ]
    );

  # in function syntax:
  use String::Print 'printi', 'sprinti'
    , modifiers => [ qr/[€₤]/ => \&money ];

  # the implementation:
  sub money$$$$)
  { my ($formatter, $modif, $value, $args) = @_;

      $modif eq '€' ? sprintf("%.2f EUR", $value+0.0001)
    : $modif eq '₤' ? sprintf("%.2f GBP", $value/1.16+0.0001)
    :                 'ERROR';
  }

Using L<printp()|String::Print/"FUNCTIONS"> makes it a little shorter, but will become quite
complex when there are more parameter in one string.

  printi "price: {p€}", p => $pi;   # price: 3.14 EUR
  printi "price: {p₤}", p => $pi;   # price: 2.71 GBP

  printp "price: %{€}s", $pi;       # price: 3.14 EUR
  printp "price: %{₤}s", $pi;       # price: 2.71 GBP

This is very useful in the translation context, where the translator can
specify abstract formatting rules.  As example, see the (GNU) gettext
files, in the translation table for Dutch into English.  The translator
tells us which currency to use in the display.

  msgid  "kostprijs: {p€}"
  msgstr "price: {p₤}"

Another example.  Now, we want to add timestamps.  In this case, we
decide for modifier names in C<\w>, so we need a blank to separate
the parameter from the modifer.

  use POSIX  qw/strftime/;
  use String::Print modifiers => [ qr/T|DT|D/ => \&_timestamp ];

  sub _timestamp($$$$)
    { my ($formatter, $modif, $value, $args) = @_;
      my $time_format
        = $modif eq 'T'  ? '%T'
        : $modif eq 'D'  ? '%F'
        : $modif eq 'DT' ? '%FT%TZ'
        :                  'ERROR';
      strftime $time_format, gmtime($value);
    };

  printi "time: {t T}",  t => $now;  # time: 10:59:17
  printi "date: {t D }", t => $now;  # date: 2013-04-13
  printi "both: {t DT}", t => $now;  # both: 2013-04-13T10:59:17Z

  printp "time: %{T}s",  $now;       # time: 10:59:17
  printp "date: %{D}s",  $now;       # date: 2013-04-13
  printp "both: %{DT}s", $now;       # both: 2013-04-13T10:59:17Z

=head3 Modifiers: stacking

You can add more than one modifier.  The modifiers detect the extend of
their own information (via a regular expression), and therefore the
formatter understands where one ends and the next begins.

The modifiers are called in order:

  printi "price: {p€%9s}\n", p => $p; # price: ␣␣␣123.45
  printi ">{t T%10s}<", t => $now;    # >␣␣12:59:17<

  printp "price: %9{€}s\n", $p;       # price: ␣␣␣123.45
  printp ">%10{T}s<", $now;           # >␣␣12:59:17<

=head2 Output encoding

[0.90] This module is used by Log::Report, which can be used (amongst
many other things) to insert (translated) strings with parameters into
HTML templates.  You can imagine that some of the parameter may need to
be encoded to HTML in the template, and other not.

=head3 example with TemplateToolkit

For example in TemplateToolkit, you would write

  # in your TT-template
  <div>Username: [% username | html %]</div>
  # in your code:
  username => $user->name,

With plain String::Print with output encoding enabled, you can do:

  # in your TT-template
  <div>[% show_username %]</div>
  # in your code with encodeFor('HTML')
  show_username => printi("Username: {user}", user => $user->name),
  # or
  show_username => printp("Username: %s", $user->name),

That does not look very efficient, however it changes for the good when
this is combined with L<Log::Report::Lexicon> (translations)  You can
either do:

  # in your TT-template
  <div>[% show_username %]</div>
  # in your code with encodeFor('HTML')
  show_username => __("Username: {user}", user => $user->name),

Shorter:

  # in your TT-template
  <div>[% loc("Username: {user}", user => username) %]</div>
  # in your code with encodeFor('HTML')
  username => $user->name,

Even shorter:

  # in your TT-template
  <div>[% loc("Username: {user.name}", user => userobj) %]</div>
  # in your code with encodeFor('HTML')
  userobj => $user,

The latter is only a few characters longer than the original example, but
it gives you localization!  Nearly for free!
  
More details in Log::Report::Extract::Template.

=head3 Output encoding exclusion

In some cases, the data which is inserted is already encoded in the
output syntax.  For instance, you already have HTML to be included.

The default exclusion rule for HTML output is C<qr/html$/i>, which
means that all inserted named parameters, where the name ends on C<html>
will not get html-entity encoded.

This will work by default:

  # with encodeFor('HTML')
  printp "Me & Co: {name}, {description_html}",
     name => 'René', description_html => $descr;

This may result in:

  Me &amp; Co: Ren&eacute;, <font color="red">new member</font>

Better not to have HTML in your program: leave it to the template.  But
in some cases, you have no choice.

=head2 Compared to other modules on CPAN

There are a quite a number of modules on CPAN which extend the functionality
of C<printf()>.  To name a few:
L<String::Format|http://search.cpan.org/~darren/String-Format>,
L<String::Errf|http://http://search.cpan.org/~rjbs/String-Errf>,
L<String::Formatter|http://http://search.cpan.org/~rjbs/String-Formatter>,
L<Text::Sprintf::Named|http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/Text-Sprintf-Named>,
L<Acme::StringFormat|http://search.cpan.org/~gfuji/Acme-StringFormat>,
L<Text::sprintf|http://search.cpan.org/~sharyanto/Text-sprintfn>,
L<Log::Sprintf|http://search.cpan.org/~frew/Log-Sprintf>, and
L<String::Sprintf|http://search.cpan.org/~bartl/String-Sprintf>.
They are all slightly different.

When the C<String::Print> module was created, none of the modules
mentioned above handled unicode correctly.  Global configuration
of serializers and modifiers is also usually not possible, sometimes
provided per explicit function call.  Only C<String::Print> cleanly
separates the roles of serializers, modifiers, and conversions.

C<String::Print> is nicely integrated with Log::Report.
