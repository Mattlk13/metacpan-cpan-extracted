NAME
    String::Pad - String padding routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.021 of String::Pad (from Perl
    distribution String-Pad), released on 2021-08-01.

SYNOPSIS
     use String::Pad qw(pad);

     my $res;

     # pad a single string
     $res = pad("foo", 5);           # => "foo  "  # default $which is 'right' or 'r'
     $res = pad("foo", 5, "left");   # => "  foo"  # left padding, which means to be 'right-justified'
     $res = pad("foo", 5, "l");      # => "  foo"  # 'l' is same thing as 'left'
     $res = pad("foo", 5, "c");      # => " foo "  # 'center' ('c') padding
     $res = pad("foo", 5, "c", "x"); # => "xfoox"  # pad with a custom character
     $res = pad("foo", 5, "c", "x"); # => "xfoox"  # pad with a custom character

     $res = pad("foobar", 5, 'r', undef, 'truncate'); # => "fooba"

     # pad multiple strings

FUNCTIONS
  pad
    Usage:

     $res = pad($text | \@texts, $width [, $which [, $padchar=' ' [, $truncate=0] ] ] ); # => str or arrayref

    Return $text padded with $padchar to $width columns. Can accept multiple
    texts ("\@texts"); in which case will return a new arrayref of padded
    texts.

    $width can be undef or -1 if you supply multiple texts, in which case
    the width will be determined from the longest text.

    $which is either "r" or "right" for padding on the right (the default if
    not specified), "l" or "left" for padding on the right, or "c" or
    "center" or "centre" for left+right padding to center the text. Note
    that "r" will mean "left justified", while "l" will mean "right
    justified".

    $padchar is whitespace if not specified. It should be string having the
    width of 1 column.

    $truncate is boolean. When set to 1, then text will be truncated when it
    is longer than $width.
