NAME
    Setup::File::Line - Insert/delete a line in a file (with undo support)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Setup::File::Line (from Perl
    distribution Setup-File-Line), released on 2021-08-02.

DESCRIPTION
    Experimental.

FUNCTIONS
  setup_file_line
    Usage:

     setup_file_line(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Insert/delete a line in a file (with undo support).

    1. On do (and when "should_exist" is true): will insert a specified line
    to file at the end. There's an option to add line at the top instead
    (set "top_style" to true). Will not add line if line already exists.
    There's an option to do case-insensitive matching when checking for
    existence of line.

    Unfixable state: file does not exist or not a regular file (directory
    and symlink included) or not open-able for read/write.

    Fixed state: file exists, line already exists in file.

    Fixable state: file exists, line doesn't exist.

    1. On do (and when "should_exist" is false): will remove specified line
    from the file. All occurence of the line will be removed.

    Unfixable state: file does not exist or not a regular file (directory
    and symlink included) or not open-able for read/write.

    Fixed state: file exists, line already does not exist in file.

    Fixable state: file exists, line exists in file.

    Note that unlike Setup::File::TextFragment's "setup_text_fragment", this
    routine does save/restore original file content on undo. Instead, this
    routine will delete all lines with same content when undoing an add, and
    adding a line when undoing a delete. This means the file might not be
    restored to an identical previous content upon undo.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   case_insensitive => *bool*

    *   line_content* => *str*

        Line (without the newline; newline will be stripped first).

    *   path* => *str*

        Path to file.

    *   should_exist => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether line should exist.

    *   top_style => *bool*

        If set to true, will insert at the top of file instead of at the
        end.

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
