 - A simple test is done after parsing to ensure that the last thing parsed
   is the end of a stencil. This is done to help hunt down syntax errors in
   stencil files.
 - Stenciller can now be created with both key-value pair and with a
   hashref.
 - The transform() method now takes plugin name, constructor args for the
   plugin, and arguments for the transformation.
 - ToHtmlPreBlock: Reduce number of line-breaks in output
 - ToUnparsedText: Ensure there are always (at least) one empty line
   between the output of each block in the stencil file.
 - ToHtmlPreBlock/ToUnparsedText: The pod author can choose to skip
   header_lines or specific stencils by giving arguments to the plugin from
   the pod command.

 - Fixed missing prereq, Types::Path::Tiny.
