SMS-Send-IN-Textlocal version 1.00
==================================
 
Please see the POD documentation in Textlocal.pm module included in the
distribution.
 
INSTALLATION
 
To install this module type the following:
 
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
 
Since Textlocal Technologies runs a paid service, the test suite 
does not actually use it to send any text message. If you wish to 
test the functionality, you should set the following four environment
variables:
 
TL_SENDID - Your DLT approved senderid / header
TL_APIKEY - Your Textlocal API key
TL_DESTPH - A mobile number in India to send a text message to
TL_MSGTXT - A message conforming with your transactional template
            registered with Textlocal as per TRAI DLT rules
 
Then, run 'make test' again and a text message will be sent.
 
DEPENDENCIES
 
This module requires these other modules and libraries:
 
  SMS::Send
  LWP::UserAgent
  File::Spec
  URI::Escape;
  JSON  
  Test::More 


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

A big thanks to authors of pre-existing regional send driver authors, my K-C
colleagues whose work on the drivers were a big inspiration. Also, a big 
shoutout to my ex-colleague Teertha Chatterjee who assisted in testing the 
code in production when it was being developed.
