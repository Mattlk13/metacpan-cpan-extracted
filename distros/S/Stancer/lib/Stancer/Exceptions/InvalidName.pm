Stancer::Exceptions::InvalidName - Invalid name

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.3

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Logging



We use the L<Log::Any> framework for logging events.
You may tell where it should log using any available L<Log::Any::Adapter> module.

For example, to log everything to a file you just have to add a line to your script, like this:
    #! /usr/bin/env perl
    use Log::Any::Adapter (File => '/var/log/payment.log');
    use Stancer::Exceptions::InvalidName;

You must import C<Log::Any::Adapter> before our libraries, to initialize the logger instance before use.

You can choose your log level on import directly:
    use Log::Any::Adapter (File => '/var/log/payment.log', log_level => 'info');

Read the L<Log::Any> documentation to know what other options you have.

Never, never, NEVER register a card or a bank account number in your database.

Always uses HTTPS in card/SEPA in communication.

Our API will never give you a complete card/SEPA number, only the last four digits.
If you need to keep track, use these last four digit.
