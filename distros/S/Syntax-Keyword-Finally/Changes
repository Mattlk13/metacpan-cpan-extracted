           finally block at all
         * Forbid `return` out of a FINALLY block
         * Forbid the use of `goto` or `next/last/redo` in a FINALLY block at
           all
         * Detect the use of nonlocal flow control out of a FINALLY block and
           at least turn the otherwise-segfault into a panic message
         * Added cross-module integration tests to check the behaviour with
           Syntax::Keyword::Try and perl 5.33.7's feature 'try'
