String containing filename of a Perl module. For convenience, when value is in
the form of:

    Foo
    Foo.pm
    Foo::Bar
    Foo/Bar
    Foo/Bar.pm

and a matching .pm file is found in `@INC`, then it will be coerced (converted)
into the path of that .pm file, e.g.:

    /home/ujang/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.24.0/lib/site_perl/5.24.0/Foo/Bar.pm

To prevent such coercion, you can use prefixing path, e.g.:

    ./Foo::Bar
    ../Foo/Bar
    /path/to/Foo/Bar

This schema comes with convenience completion too.
