String containing filename of a Perl POD or module. For convenience, when value
is in the form of:

    Foo
    Foo.pod
    Foo.pm
    Foo::Bar
    Foo/Bar
    Foo/Bar.pod
    Foo/Bar.pm

and a matching .pod or .pm file is found in `@INC`, then it will be coerced
(converted) into the path of that .pod/.pm file, e.g.:

    /home/ujang/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.24.0/lib/site_perl/5.24.0/Foo/Bar.pm
    lib/Foo/Bar.pod

To prevent such coercion, you can use prefixing path, e.g.:

    ./Foo::Bar
    ../Foo/Bar
    /path/to/Foo/Bar

This schema comes with convenience completion too.

This schema is like another schema `perl::filename` except that .pod is
prioritized over .pm. If both `Foo.pm` and `Foo.pod` are found in `@INC`, the
path to `Foo.pod` will be returned.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.027 of Sah::Schema::perl::pod_or_pm_filename (from Perl distribution Sah-Schemas-Perl), released on 2020-02-15.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

String containing filename of a Perl POD or module. For convenience, when value
is in the form of:

 Foo
 Foo.pod
 Foo.pm
 Foo::Bar
 Foo/Bar
 Foo/Bar.pod
 Foo/Bar.pm

and a matching .pod or .pm file is found in C<@INC>, then it will be coerced
(converted) into the path of that .pod/.pm file, e.g.:

 /home/ujang/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.24.0/lib/site_perl/5.24.0/Foo/Bar.pm
 lib/Foo/Bar.pod

To prevent such coercion, you can use prefixing path, e.g.:

 ./Foo::Bar
 ../Foo/Bar
 /path/to/Foo/Bar

This schema comes with convenience completion too.

This schema is like another schema C<perl::filename> except that .pod is
prioritized over .pm. If both C<Foo.pm> and C<Foo.pod> are found in C<@INC>, the
path to C<Foo.pod> will be returned.
