NAME
    Sah::SchemaBundle::CPAN - Sah schemas related to CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.016 of Sah::SchemaBundle::CPAN (from
    Perl distribution Sah-SchemaBundle-CPAN), released on 2024-06-13.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   cpan::distname

        A distribution name on CPAN, e.g. "Module-Installed-Tiny".

        This schema can be used to validate a CPAN distribution name. It's
        like the "perl::distname" schema, but with completion from
        distribution names on CPAN (using lcpan). It does not check whether
        a CPAN distribution exists or not (indexed on PAUSE); use the
        "cpan::distname::exists" or "cpan::distname::not_exists" schemas for
        that purpose.

    *   cpan::modname

        A module name on CPAN, e.g. 'Module::Installed::Tiny'.

        This schema can be used to validate a CPAN module name. It's like
        the "perl::modname" schema, but with completion from module names on
        CPAN (using lcpan). It does not check whether a CPAN module exists
        or not (indexed on PAUSE); use the "cpan::modname::exists" or
        "cpan::modname::not_exists" schemas for that purpose.

    *   cpan::pause_id

        PAUSE author ID, e.g. 'PERLANCAR'.

        This schema can be used to validate a PAUSE ID. It's basically just
        "str" with checks for valid characters and accepted length (2-9
        characters). Whether the PAUSE ID exists is not checked by this
        schema; see the "cpan::pause_id::exists" and
        "cpan::pause_id::not_exists" for that purpose.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
