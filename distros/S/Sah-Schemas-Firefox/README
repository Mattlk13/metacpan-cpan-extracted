NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Firefox - Various Sah schemas related to Firefox

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.008 of Sah::Schemas::Firefox (from
    Perl distribution Sah-Schemas-Firefox), released on 2023-06-14.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   firefox::local_profile_name

        Firefox profile name, must exist in local Firefox installation.

        This is like the "firefox::profile_name" schema, but adds a check
        (in "prefilter" clause) that the profile must exist in local Firefox
        installation.

    *   firefox::local_profile_name::default_first

        Firefox profile name, must exist in local Firefox installation,
        default to first.

        This is like "firefox::local_profile_name" schema, but adds a
        default value rule to pick the first profile in the local Firefox
        installation.

    *   firefox::profile_name

        Firefox profile name.

        This is currently just "str" with a minimum length of 1, but adds a
        completion rule to complete from list of profiles from local Firefox
        installation.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
