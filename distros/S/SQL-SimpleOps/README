SQL-SimpleOps version 2023.362.1
================================

 The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
 how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
 example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
 that should be provided before the module is installed.

 A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
 README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
 archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
 good idea to provide version information here so that people can
 decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

 To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test		# see: TESTS, considerations and retrictions
  make install

TESTS

 The installation have three differents tests:

 * TEST SQL COMMAND (no additional settings required):

   The test routine for the 'sql' command simulates some models of calls to
   demonstrate the correct formating of SQL Command.

   This test will automatic doing in the 'make test' process.

   You can run in iteractive tests, use:

   # perl t/testSQL.t

 * TEST WHERE CLAUSE (no additional settings required):

   The test routine for the 'where' clause simulates some models to
   demonstrate the correct formating of the selection conditions.

   This test will automatic doing in the 'make test' process.

   Only failed tests will be shown, however, the following command can
   be used to show details for success results:

   # export SQL_SIMPLE_WHERE_SHOW_OK=1

   You can run in iteractive tests, use:

   # perl t/testWhere.t

 * TEST DATABASE COMMANDS (additional settings required):

   CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION
   CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION
   CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION -- CAUTION

   The test will execute actions inside the database
   (create, insert, select, updates, delete and drop).

   The process have two levels of tests:

   1) Create and Drop Database/Schema/Tables and;

   2) Insert/Select/Update/Delete rows in the tables.

   BEWARE: For security reasons we recommends only empty database/schema 
   in the tests, remember, the tests doing changes and drop all the data,
   tables, schema and database. See: "Making the Tests inside Databases".

   see: "PREPARATION - MAKING THE TESTS INSIDE DATABASES" how to execute database tests.

PREPARATION

 * MAKING THE TESTS INSIDE DATABASES

   This section explain about the level of tests and restrictions.

   The execution of the "TEST DATABASE COMMANDS" depends on the creation of
   system environments.

   These environments must be pre-defined before the process.

   Their consist of database parameters for: identifying, authentication,
   connecting, and execution SQL commands.

   There are specific environments for each type of database.

   The omission of a set of specific database environments does not
   compromise the validation of the others databases.

   You can define only the variables of the databases that you really
   want to test.

   The tests will:

   a) Create a temporary database (if requested);
   b) Create a temporary tables (if requested);
   c) Execute the main commands on the tables and;
   d) Drop tables and databases at end of the tests (if requested).

   The 'a,b and d' can be ignored if you for pre-created database to test.

   To make tests you must sets system exported environment, where you can
   run with or withou database/schema/tables/roles creation.

   - To test without the Create and Drop you must define the environment:

     # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_TEST_CREATE_ALLOWED=
     # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_TEST_SKIP_CREATE=1

   - To test with the Create and Drop you must define the environment:

     # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_TEST_CREATE_ALLOWED=1
     # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_TEST_SKIP_CREATE=

     BEWARE: Do not use pre-existing databases users data to run the Create
     and Drop test, remember, at end all tables and data will be DESTROYED.

     NOTE: The exported sets must be done to grant the access to tests.

   - The procedure for creating database, schema, tables and roles,
     see 'HOW TO PRE-CREATE'.

 * HOW TO PRE-CREATE THE DATABASES/SCHEMA/TABLES/ROLES?

   This section explain how to get the command to pre-create process.

   # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_SHOW_CREATE=1
   # export SQL_SIMPLE_MYSQL=1
   # export SQL_SIMPLE_MYSQL_DB=test_db
   # export SQL_SIMPLE_PG=1
   # export SQL_SIMPLE_PG_DB=test_db
   # export SQL_SIMPLE_PG_SCHEMA=test_db
   # export SQL_SIMPLE_SQLITE=1
   # perl t/testDB.t

   IMPORTANT:

   a) This example show the 'test_db' as 'database name' and 'schema name'.
   b) You may use differents name of database or schema for your tests.
   c) Copy/Paste the STDOUT database section to pre-create.

 * GETTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE TESTS.

   a) Show the SQL command after execution.

      # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_SHOW_SQL=1

   b) Show table of contents load in database (long list) before the tests.

      # export SQL_SIMPLE_DB_SHOW_CONTENTS=1
  
   c) Run the interactive creation database in verbose mode

      # export SQL_SIMPLE_MYSQL_DEBUG=1
      # export SQL_SIMPLE_PG_DEBUG=1
      # export SQL_SIMPLE_SQLITE_DEBUG=1

   d) Get where details for t/testWhere.t

      # export SQL_SIMPLE_WHERE_SHOW=1

   e) Redefining database CLI:

      # export SQL_SIMPLE_MYSQL_CLI=[fullpath]

	*defaults:
         - /usr/bin/mysql
         - /usr/bin/mariadb
         - /usr/local/bin/mysql
         - /usr/local/bin/mariadb
 
      # export SQL_SIMPLE_PG_CLI=[fullpath]

        *defaults:
         - /usr/bin/psql
         - /usr/local/bin/psql

      # export SQL_SIMPLE_SQLITE_CLI=[fullpath]

        *defaults:
         - /usr/bin/sqlite3
         - /usr/local/bin/sqlite3
 
MAKING STANDARD TESTS

 A) If the system environment was defined before the test will be done:

    # perl Makefile.PL && make && make install && make test

    The database test will be executed in 'make test' process.

    However, i recommend iterative testing as described below.

 B) Can i execute all database tests in same time?
    Answer: YES. Create all database environments and run the test.

MAKING ITERACTIVE TEST UNDER SQLITE

  a) Iteractive configurations is required;
  a) SQLite2 is not supported;
