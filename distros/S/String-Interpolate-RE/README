String::Interpolate::RE

This module interpolates variables into strings using regular expression
matching rather than Perl's built-in interpolation mechanism and thus
hopefully does not suffer from the security problems inherent in using
eval to interpolate into strings of suspect ancestry.

  Changing the default option values

The default values for "strinterp"'s options were not all well thought
out. String::Interpolate::RE uses Exporter::Tiny, allowing a version of
"strinterp" with saner defaults to be exported. Simply specify them when
importing:

  use String::Interpolate::RE strinterp => { opts => { useenv => 0 } };

The subroutine may be renamed using the "-as" option:

  use String::Interpolate::RE strinterp => { -as => strinterp_noenv,
                                             opts => { useenv => 0 } };

  strinterp_noenv( ... );
