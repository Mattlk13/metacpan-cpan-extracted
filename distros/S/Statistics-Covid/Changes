Revision history for Statistics-Covid

0.21	XXX
	1) Added dependency to DBIx::Class in Makefile.PL
	after alert from SREZIC (cpan).
0.20    2020-03-27
	1) Fixed a bug whereas the config hash read from a
	shared file was used for many DataProviders and each one
	was making a change to a shared hash. I used Storable::dclone()
	to clone the hash to each DataProvider constructor.
	2) Moved tests which required network access to xt/network.
	3) Added Statistics::Covid::Analysis::Plot which plots data
	to file using Chart::Clicker and also GD::Graph.
	Experiment with Chart::GGPlot.
	4) added a sub datums2dataframe which converts data from
	many Datum objects (e.g. as fetched from DB after a select)
	into a "DataFrame" which contains the same data grouped
	wrt one or more fields.
0.19    2020-03-26
	Changed the database schema for table Datum so that
	column name 'area' is now 'real' and not 'integer'
	as it was previously.
	Fixed documentation issues.
0.13    2020-03-26
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
