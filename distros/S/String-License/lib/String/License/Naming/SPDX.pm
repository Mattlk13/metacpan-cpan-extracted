=head1 NAME

String::License::Naming::SPDX - licenses as named by SPDX

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.0.5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use String::License::Naming::SPDX;

    my $spdx = String::License::Naming::SPDX->new;

    my $license = [ grep { /^(Expat|Perl)$/ } $spdx->list_licenses ];  # => is_deeply ['Perl']

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<String::License::Naming> enumerates supported licenses
matching an ordered set of naming schemes,
or enumerates the names of supported license naming schemes.

Some licenses are known by different names.
E.g. the license "MIT" according to SPDX
is named "Expat" in Debian.

Some licenses are not always represented.
E.g. "Perl" is a (discouraged) license in Debian
while it is a relationship of several licenses with SPDX
(and that expression is recommended in Debian as well).

By default,
licenses are matched using naming schemes C<[ 'spdx', 'internal' ]>,
which lists all supported licenses,
preferrably by their SPDX name
or as fallback by an internal name.
