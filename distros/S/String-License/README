NAME
    String::License - detect source code license statements in a text string

VERSION
    Version v0.0.3

SYNOPSIS
        use String::License;
        use String::License::Naming::Custom;

        my $string = 'Licensed under same terms as Perl itself';

        my $expressed  = String::License->new( string => $string );
        my $expression = $expressed->as_text;  # => "Perl"

        my $desc        = String::License::Naming::Custom->new;
        my $described   = String::License->new( string => $string, naming => $desc );
        my $description = $described->as_text;  # => "The Perl 5 License"

DESCRIPTION
    String::License identifies license statements in a string and serializes
    them in a normalized format.

CONSTRUCTOR
    new
            my $licensed = String::License->new( string => 'Licensed under GPLv2' );

        Accepts named arguments, and constructs and returns a String::License
        object.

        The following options are recognized:

        string => STRING
            The scalar string to parse for licensing information.

        naming => OBJ
            A String::License::Naming object, used to define license naming
            conventions.

            By default uses String::License::Naming::SPDX.

            Since instantiation of naming schemes is expensive, there can be a
            significant speed boost in passing a pre-initialized naming object
            when processing multiple strings.

METHODS
    as_text
        Returns identified licensing patterns as a string, either structured
        as SPDX License Expressions, or with scheme-less naming as a short
        description.
