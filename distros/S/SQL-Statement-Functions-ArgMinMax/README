DESCRIPTION

    This distribution contains several SQL functions to be used with
    SQL::Statement:

     ARGMAXNUM()
     ARGMAXSTR()
     ARGMINNUM()
     ARGMINSTR()

    These functions are not aggregate functions. They are added due to the
    lack of CASE statement as well as IF function in SQL::Statement. For
    example, this SQL statement:

     SELECT CASE WHEN a > b THEN a ELSE b END FROM table

    can be expressed with:

     SELECT ARGMAXNUM(a, b) FROM table

    To use a function from Perl script:

     require SQL::Statement::Function::ByName::ARGMAXNUM;
     $dbh->do(qq{CREATE FUNCTION ARGMAXNUM NAME "SQL::Statement::Function::ByName::ARGMAXNUM::SQL_FUNCTION_ARGMAXNUM"});

    To use a function from fsql:

     % fsql -F ARGMAXNUM --add-csv path/to/sometable.csv "SELECT ARGMAXNUM(col1,col2) FROM sometable ..."
