NAME
    Sort::Sub::by_several - Sort by one or more sorters

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Sort::Sub::by_several (from
    Perl distribution Sort-Sub-by_several), released on 2019-12-17.

SYNOPSIS
    Generate sorter (accessed as variable) via Sort::Sub import:

     use Sort::Sub '$by_several'; # use '$by_several<i>' for case-insensitive sorting, '$by_several<r>' for reverse sorting
     my @sorted = sort $by_several ('item', ...);

    Generate sorter (accessed as subroutine):

     use Sort::Sub 'by_several<ir>';
     my @sorted = sort {by_several} ('item', ...);

    Generate directly without Sort::Sub:

     use Sort::Sub::by_several;
     my $sorter = Sort::Sub::by_several::gen_sorter(
         ci => 1,      # default 0, set 1 to sort case-insensitively
         reverse => 1, # default 0, set 1 to sort in reverse order
     );
     my @sorted = sort $sorter ('item', ...);

    Use in shell/CLI with sortsub (from App::sortsub):

     % some-cmd | sortsub by_several
     % some-cmd | sortsub by_several --ignore-case -r
