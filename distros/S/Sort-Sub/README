NAME
    Sort::Sub - Collection of sort subroutines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.111 of Sort::Sub (from Perl
    distribution Sort-Sub), released on 2019-10-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use Sort::Sub qw($naturally);

     my @sorted = sort $naturally ('track1.mp3', 'track10.mp3', 'track2.mp3', 'track1b.mp3', 'track1a.mp3');
     # => ('track1.mp3', 'track1a.mp3', 'track1b.mp3', 'track2.mp3', 'track10.mp3')

    Request as subroutine:

     use Sort::Sub qw(naturally);

     my @sorted = sort {naturally} (...);

    Request a reverse sort:

     use Sort::Sub qw($naturally<r>);

     my @sorted = sort $naturally (...);
     # => ('track10.mp3', 'track2.mp3', 'track1b.mp3', 'track1a.mp3', 'track1.mp3')

    Request a case-insensitive sort:

     use Sort::Sub qw($naturally<i>);

     my @sorted = sort $naturally (...);

    Request a case-insensitive, reverse sort:

     use Sort::Sub qw($naturally<ir>);

     my @sorted = sort $naturally ('track2.mp3', 'Track1.mp3', 'Track10.mp3');
     => ('Track10.mp3', 'track2.mp3', 'Track1.mp3')

    Pass arguments to sort generator routine:

     use Sort::Sub '$by_num_of_colons', {pattern=>':'};

     my @sorted = sort $by_num_of_colons ('a::','b:','c::::','d:::');
     => ('b:','a::','d:::','c::::')

DESCRIPTION
    Sort::Sub and "Sort::Sub::*" are a convenient packaging of any kind of
    subroutine which you can use for "sort()".

    To use Sort::Sub, you import a list of:

     ["$"]NAME [ "<" [i][r] ">" ]

    Where NAME is actually searched under "Sort::Sub::*" namespace. For
    example:

     naturally

    will attempt to load "Sort::Sub::naturally" module and call its
    "gen_sorter" subroutine.

    You can either request a subroutine name like the above or a variable
    name (e.g. $naturally).

    After the name, you can add some options, enclosed with angle brackets
    "<>". There are some known options, e.g. "i" (for case-insensitive sort)
    or "r" (for reverse sort). Some examples:

     naturally<i>
     naturally<r>
     naturally<ri>

GUIDELINES FOR WRITING A SORT::SUB::* MODULE
    The name should be in lowercase. It should be an adverb (e.g.
    "naturally") or a phrase with words separated by underscore ("_") and
    the phrase begins with "by" (e.g. "by_num_and_non_num_parts").

    The module must contain a "gen_sorter" subroutine. It will be called
    with:

     ($is_reverse, $is_ci, $args)

    Where $is_reserve will be set to true if user requests a reverse sort,
    $is_ci will be set to true if user requests a case-insensitive sort.
    $args is hashref to pass additional arguments to the "gen_sorter()"
    routine. The subroutine should return a code reference.
