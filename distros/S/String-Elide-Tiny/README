    word-aware. It has options to choose marker or to select side(s) to
    truncate.

FUNCTIONS
  elide
    Usage:

     my $truncated = elide($str, $max_len [ , \%opts ])

    Elide a string with " ..." if length exceeds $max_len.

    Known options:

    *   truncate

        String, either "right", "left", "middle", "ends".

    *   marker

        String. Default: "...".

SEE ALSO
    Text::Elide is also quite simple and elides at word boundaries, but it's
    not tiny enough.

    Text::Truncate is tiny enough, but does not support truncating at the
    left/both ends.

    String::Elide::Parts can elide at different points of the string.

    String::Truncate has similar interface like String::Elide::Parts and has
    some options. But it's not tiny: it has a couple of non-core
    dependencies.

    String::Elide::Lines is based on this module but works on a line-basis.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
