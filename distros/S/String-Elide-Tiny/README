SEE ALSO
    Text::Elide is also quite simple and elides at word boundaries, but it's
    not tiny enough.

    Text::Truncate is tiny enough, but does not support truncating at the
    left/both ends.

    String::Elide::Parts can elide at different points of the string.

    String::Truncate has similar interface like String::Elide::Parts and has
    some options. But it's not tiny: it has a couple of non-core
    dependencies.

    String::Elide::Lines is based on this module but works on a line-basis.
