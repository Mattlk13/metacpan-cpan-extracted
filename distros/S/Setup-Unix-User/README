 How to create user without creating a group with the same name as that
 user?

    By default, group is set to the same name as the user. This will create
    group with the same name as the user (if the group didn't exist). You
    can set group to an existing group, e.g. users and the setup function
    will not create a new group with the same name as user. But note that
    the group must already exist (if it does not, you can create it first
    using Setup::Unix::Group).
