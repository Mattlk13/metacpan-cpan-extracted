Revision history for Statistics-Sequences-Joins-0.20

0.20 2016.03.17
    - added optional argument "ncorr" to variance() and so z_value() methods to include the Burdick-Kelly correction for small N (used by default to now, and still)
    - changed obsdev() so that it also--like expected(), variance(), etc.--works with sufficient statistics (specifying trials and prob); only the "observed" value also needs to be specified
    - added croak() to observed() if it fails to find a sequence of data (a referenced array, with a non-zero scalar value) that has been pre-loaded or given by the arg "data"
    - removed aliases for observed(), expected(), variance(), z_value() and p_value() methods for brevity and so as to be compatible with other Statistics::Sequences modules. Most of these aliases were already removed from PODs of earlier versions. They are still supported (in the background) but unlikely to be supported in any later version.
    - substantially expanded/revised POD.

    - get p-value as well as z-value from method zscore returned if wantarray.
