NAME

    Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically - dynamically change the value of a
    variable

SYNOPSIS

       use Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically;
    
       my $logger = ...;
    
       sub operate
       {
          dynamically $logger->level = LOG_DEBUG;
    
          do_things();
       }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a syntax plugin that implements a single keyword,
    dynamically, which alters the behaviour of a scalar assignment
    operation. Syntactically and semantically it is similar to the built-in
    perl keyword local, but is implemented somewhat differently to give two
    key advantages over regular local:

      * You can dynamically assign to lvalue functions and accessors.

      * You can dynamically assign to regular lexical variables.

    Semantically, the behaviour can be considered equivalent to

       {
          my $old = $VAR;
          $VAR = "new value";
    
          ...
    
          $VAR = $old;
       }

    Except that the old value will also be restored in the case of
    exceptions, goto, next/last/redo or similar ways to leave the
    controlling block scope.

KEYWORDS

 dynamically

       {
          dynamically LVALUE = EXPR;
          ...
       }

    The dynamically keyword modifies the behaviour of the following
    expression. which must be a scalar assignemnt. Before the new value is
    assigned to the lvalue, its current value is captured and stored
    internally within the Perl interpreter. When execution leaves the
    controlling block for whatever reason, as part of block scope cleanup
    the saved value is restored.

    The LVALUE may be any kind of expression that allows normal scalar
    assignment; lexical or package scalar variables, elements of arrays or
    hashes, or the result of calling an :value function or method.

    If the LVALUE has any GET magic associated with it (including a FETCH
    method of a tied scalar) then this will be executed exactly once when
    the dynamically expression is evaluated.

    If the LVALUE has any SET magic associated with it (including a STORE
    method of a tied scalar) then this will be executed exactly once when
    the dynamically expression is evaluated, and again a second time when
    the controlling scope is unwound.
