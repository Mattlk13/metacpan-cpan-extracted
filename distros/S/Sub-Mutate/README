NAME

Sub::Mutate - examination and modification of subroutines

DESCRIPTION

This module is a backward-compatibility wrapper repackaging functions
that are now supplied by other modules.  It is deprecated to use this
module: you should instead get the functions directly from Sub::Metadata
or Sub::WhenBodied as appropriate.
