* Software::Copyright Perl module

** Description

This class holds a copyright statement, i.e. a set of year range, name
and email.

On construction, a cleanup is done to make the statements more
standard. Here are some cleanup example:

#+begin_example
 2002-6 Joe => 2002-2006, Joe
 2001,2002,2003,2004 Joe => 2001-2004, Joe
 # found in markdown documents
 2002 Joe mailto:joe@example.com => 2002, Joe <joe@example.com>
#+end_example

The constructor is also compatible with the string given by Debian's
[[https://manpages.debian.org/licensecheck/licensecheck.1p.en.html][licensecheck]], i.e. the statements can be separated by "=/=".

See [[file:lib/Software/Copyright.pm][Software::Copyright]] doc for more details.
