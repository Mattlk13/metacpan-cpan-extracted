* Software::Copyright Perl module

** Description

This class holds a copyright statement, i.e. a set of year range, name
and email.

On construction, a cleanup is done to make the statements more
standard. Here are some cleanup examples:

| Before                  | After          |
|-------------------------+----------------|
| 2002-6 Joe              | 2002-2006, Joe |
| 2001,2002,2003,2004 Joe | 2001-2004, Joe |

The constructor is also compatible with the string given by Debian's
[[https://manpages.debian.org/licensecheck/licensecheck.1p.en.html][licensecheck]], i.e. the statements can be separated by "=/=".

See [[file:lib/Software/Copyright.pm][Software::Copyright]] doc for more details.
