NAME
    Sah::Schemas::Re - Various regular-expression schemas

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Sah::Schemas::Re (from Perl
    distribution Sah-Schemas-Re), released on 2022-08-20.

SAH SCHEMAS
    The following schemas are included in this distribution:

    *   re_from_str

        Regexp object from string using Regexp::From::String's str_to_re().

        This schema accepts Regexp object or string which will be coerced to
        Regexp object using Regexp::From::String's "str_to_re()" function.

        Basically, if string is of the form of "/.../" or "qr(...)", then
        you could specify metacharacters as if you are writing a literal
        regexp pattern in Perl. Otherwise, your string will be
        "quotemeta()"-ed first then compiled to Regexp object. This means in
        the second case you cannot specify metacharacters.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
