    1.24 Changed to Devel::Size in Cache::Memory
    
    The old code was slow and underestimated the size 10 times or
    more. Using Devel::Size is optional, defaulting to a slightly updated
    old code if it's not found.

    situations when site configuration is not available yet.

    Sub-level testing added
    
    Just testing, no functional changes and no version bump. There was a
    scare that this did not work right, that turned out to be unfounded.

    Forced ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.64
    
    That's the version that understands TEST_REQUIRES, otherwise an
    unsatisfied dependency on Test::Unit::Lite prevents the build on some
    installations with modern perl, but really old MakeMaker.

    1.21 Fixed a stupid build bug
    
    The idea of making CHANGES from a git log back fired in CPAN
    distribution. Fixed now hopefully.
