=head1 C++ at_perl_destroy()

    void at_perl_destroy (const panda::function<void()>& f);

Sometimes you need to be notified, when Perl interpreter is about to be
destroyed. This is needed when you captured some Perl structures and want
to release them properly or invoke other clean-up functions.

This hook function is similar to C<END> block of a perl module, but on C++
layer.

The added hook-functions are executed in the order they added (FIFO). Here is
an example:

    at_perl_destroy([](){
        std::cout << "perl interpreter is about to be destoryed\n";
    });
