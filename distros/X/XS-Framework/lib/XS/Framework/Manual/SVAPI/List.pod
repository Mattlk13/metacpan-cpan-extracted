=head1 List

=head2 Overview

The purpose of C<List> class is to call subroutines in B<list context>,
as well as return into perl list instead of array (this is provided by shipped
typemap specialization).

List is child-class of C<Array>, so it basically inherits all Array's methods.

List context is applied by:

    auto list = sub.call<List>(params...);
