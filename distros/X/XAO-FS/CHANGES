    Version bump on XAO::FS to 1.17

commit f905cd81b4e3caa88e5eacf7c4a9a471f39360ae
Author: Andrew Maltsev <am@ejelta.com>

    Better support for default values
    
    * Fixing stored defaults if they are out of sync with the config
    * New test case for defaults
    * Validating default against other constraints
    * Real/integer values are converted to such
    
    What started this is MariaDB not being able to store '' string in a
    numeric field in version 10.2.9, which broke an existing db that had
    empty defaults for numerics.

    Updated for using in perlbrew environment
    
    No functional changes -- just replacing hard coded /usr/bin/perl path
    with PATH based perl, wherever it might be.

    Removed STDERR redirect on reconnects
    
    If DBD wants to print a warning so be it, removed temporary redirect to
    null. That's faster and cleaner.

    Preserving layers when redirecting STDERR
    
    It's a bit of a hack, but should work for when STDERR has some
    non-default encoding layers applied to it (like UTF-8).

    Added 'objname' call to XAO::DO::Atom
    
    It's useful to have an all Atom derived objects and does not conflict
    with anything.

    Changes for CPAN - testcases name space
    
    Uploaded all the most recent changes to CPAN, which resulted in
    conflicts because of namespace reuse in test cases. Fixed that.
