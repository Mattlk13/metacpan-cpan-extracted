    v1.90 Fixed error handling in FilloutForm
    
    Error messages returned from external error checking were not included
    in field HTML content. Default content does not use that, but it did not
    work if a site used custom templates that rely on error messages (e.g.
    for styling).

    1.87 Filtering out %00 in CgiParam

    1.86: Fixed subtle bugin 1.85 (json object caching)
    
    Since 1.85 returned a cached JSON object and then could call utf8(0)
    on it when embedding that effectively switched the cached object to
    character mode.
    
    This can also happen in client code and there is no easy way to protect
    the cached object, so removed the caching completely.

    v1.85 Made it possible to output sorted "canonical" JSON
    
    This is useful for stabilizing output, making it unchanged on the same
    data from one run to another.
