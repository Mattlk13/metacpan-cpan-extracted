    1.75 Fixed <%URL%> in PSGI environment
    
    Due to PSGI setting PATH_INFO and REQUEST_URI to the same value CGI.pm
    returns an empty value for url(-absolute => 1). That seems wrong, but
    that is what it is.
    
    Changed to use request_uri() instead, which works in both Apache and
    PSGI.

    Expiring obsolete keys instead of deleting
    
    There could be a race condition with deleting if multiple sessions run
    in parallel.

    1.74 Minor Web::Benchmark test case update
    
    Conputers are becoming too fast, a couple if iterations can
    still result in a zero time spent...

    1.73 pageurl() returns real unmodified URL
    
    This was an old problem where for URLs like http://sample.com/foo/
    a call to pageurl() would return http://sample.com/foo/index.html
    (appending index.html). This affected all of the derived code, most
    importantly <%URL...%> template calls.
    
    Changed to return the actual URL as was requested, not as it was
    interpreted in file templates.
    
    Also fixed benchmark stats sort stability in testing for

    Removed EUMM upgrade compat WriteMakefile1
    
    There is already a requirement for version 6.64 of MakeMaker, so it
    seems unnecessary.
