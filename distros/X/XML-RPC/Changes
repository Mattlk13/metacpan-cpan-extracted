    * Implement typecasting
    * Add suggestion that people use Randy Ray's RPC::XML instead for new projects

2017/11/21  (1.1)
    * Add facility to add HTTP *Basic* Auth
    * Require LWP::Protocol::https to be installed
      (hey, it's 2017, we can assume that https is available....)

    * Implement recommended patch for #75078 "autodetection of XML datatyp <i4> for string of digits starting with 0"
