DESCRIPTION

    The muralis script displays a given image file on the desktop
    background (that is, the root window) of an X-windows display.

    This tries to determine what size would best suit the image; whether to
    show it fullscreen or normal size, whether to show it tiled or centred
    on the screen. Setting the options overrides this behaviour.

    One can also repeat the display of the last-displayed image, changing
    the display options as one desires.

    This uses the an external program to display the image file; display
    backends are implemented as plugins. To find out which bckends are
    available, use the --backends option to print a list of them.

    This also depends on xwininfo to get information about the root window.

 The Name

    The name "muralis" comes from the Latin "muralis" which is the word
    from which "mural" was derived. I just thought it was a cool name for a
    wallpaper script.

OPTIONS

    Boolean options can be disabled by prefixing them with 'no'; for
    example, --notile will turn off tiling of the image.

    --backends

      List which display backends are available. Note that this doesn't
      just check which plugin modules are installed, but also checks
      whether the program used by the backend is available.

    --centre | --center

      Centre the image on the root window.

    --colours num | --colors num

      Limit the number of colours used to display the image. This is useful
      for a 256-colour display. Only supported by some backends.

    --config_dir directory

      Alternative directory in which to look for muralis config files.

    --dir directory

      Directory in which to look for image files. This can be repeated for
      more directories.

    --exclude string

      If an image matches this, it is excluded from --random, --list, or
      --nth display.

    --is_image string

      What files are considered to be image files? This is a regular
      expression checked against the filenames to see if they are image
      files. By default, muralis checks for commonly known image
      extensions, so that it doesn't try to display non-image files (such
      as text files) which might be in the image directories. Most of the
      time you don't need to use this option.

    --fullscreen

      The image will be zoomed to fit the size of the screen, keeping the
      aspect ratio the same if the backend supports this.

    --help

      Print help message and exit.

    --list

      List all the images muralis knows about. If --match is given, this
      will restrict the list to those images matching the match-string.
      (see --listformat)

    --listformat format

      This defines the format used in the --list command. The format is
      either "normal" or "fullname". The normal format gives the directory
      names followed by the files in them. The "fullname" format gives just
      the full names of the files.

    --manpage

      Print the full help documentation (manual page) and exit. This will
      only work if you have perldoc installed.

    --match string

      If using the --list or --random options, limit the image(s) to those
      which match the string.

    --nth num

      Display the nth image. If --match is given, limit the selection to
      images which match the match-string.

    --option string

      An additional option or options to pass on to the backend. Used for
      uncommon options which are supported in one backend and not another.

    --outfile

      Output file for the --list command to print its output. If this
      argument is not given, list will list to standard output.

    --provides backend

      What options will work for this backend?

    --random

      Pick a random image to display. If --match is given, limit the
      selection to images which match the match-string.

    --repeat_last

      Display the last image which was displayed. This is useful to
      re-display an image while overriding the default display options.

    --stretch

      The image will be zoomed to fit the size of the screen. This does not
      preserve the aspect ratio. Some backends support both fullscreen and
      stretch, while some support only one or the other, in which case they
      are treated the same.

    --tile

      Tile the image to fill the root window.

    --unseen

      When using the --rand or --nth option, this selects the images from a
      list of 'unseen' images. This can be used to cycle through your
      images without repeats. If this option is not used, then the --random
      option is truly random.

      The 'unseen' list is in the '~/.muralis/unseen' file, which is
      automatically updated or created whenever the --unseen option is
      used. Note that if this file exists and the --unseen option is used,
      muralis does not check the image directories, so if you have added a
      new directory to your options, you will need to delete the 'unseen'
      file in order to reset the list of unseen images.

    --use backend

      Which backend to use. See backends.

    --verbose

      Print informational messages.

    --version

      Print version information and exit.

    --window window-id

      Display on the given window, rather than the root window. This is
      useful for window-managers which take over the desktop display. Only
      works for backends which provide this option.

    --zoom percent

      Enlarge or reduce the size of the image by the given percent.

ENVIRONMENT

    HOME

      muralis looks in the HOME directory for config files.

    Configuration files for muralis are placed in the $HOME/.muralis
    directory (which is created if it doesn't exist).

    ~/.muralis/config

      Configuration file; contains command-line arguments in
      Getopt::ArgvFile format.

    ~/.muralis/last

      The name of the most recently displayed image.

    ~/.muralis/unseen

      Contains a list of unseen image files.
