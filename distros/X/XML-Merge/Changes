      * added use XML::Tidy to make sure exports are available

      * removed 02prune.t and moved 03keep.t to 02keep.t ... passing tests
      is good

    - 1.2.4CCJWiB Sun Dec 12 19:32:44:11 2004
      * guessing how to fix Darwin test failure @ t/02prune.t first prune()
      call

    - 1.0.4CAL5IS Fri Dec 10 21:05:18:28 2004
      * fixed buggy _recmerge

    - 1.0.4CAEU0I Fri Dec 10 14:30:00:18 2004
      * made accessors for _id_xpath_list

      * made _id_xpath_list take XPath locations instead of elem names (old
      _idea)

      * made test _cres (at Marc's request)

      * made warn _cres croak

      * made Merge inherit from Tidy (which inherits from XPath)

      * separated reload(), strip(), tidy(), prune(), and write() into own
      XML::Tidy module

    - 1.0.4C2Nf0R Thu Dec 2 23:41:00:27 2004

    - 1.0.4C2BcI2 Thu Dec 2 11:38:18:02 2004

    - 1.0.4C1JHOl Wed Dec 1 19:17:24:47 2004
      * commented out override stuff since it's probably bad form and dumps
      crap warnings all over tests and causes them to fail... so I guess
      just uncomment that stuff if you care to preserve PI's and escapes

    - 1.0.4C1J7gt Wed Dec 1 19:07:42:55 2004
      * made merge() accept merge_source_xpath and merge_destination_xpath
      params

      * made merge() accept other Merge objects

      * made reload() not clobber basic escapes (by overriding Text
      toString())

      * made tidy() not kill processing-instructions (by overriding
      node_test())

      * made tidy() not kill comments

    - 1.0.4BOHGjm Wed Nov 24 17:16:45:48 2004
      * fixed merge() same elems with diff ids bug

    - 1.0.4BNBCZL Tue Nov 23 11:12:35:21 2004
      * rewrote both merge() and _recmerge() _cres stuff since it was buggy
      before... so hopefully consistently good now

    - 1.0.4BMJCPm Mon Nov 22 19:12:25:48 2004
      * fixed merge() for empty elem matching and _cres on text kids

    - 1.0.4BMGTLF Mon Nov 22 16:29:21:15 2004
      * separated reload() from strip() so that prune() can call it too
