NAME

    Mojolicious::Plugin::NoServerHeader - Removes the Server header from
    every Mojolicious response

STATUS

SYNOPSIS

      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin 'NoServerHeader';
    
      # Mojolicious
      $app->plugin('NoServerHeader');

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Plugin::NoServerHeader removes the default Server header,
    "Mojolicious (Perl)", from every response. This can be useful for
    security reasons if there was ever a known exploit for Mojolicious. If
    you are really concerned about this, you should also change the default
    error pages like the failraptor
    <https://mojolicious.org/mojo/failraptor.png>, although those are
    probably less obvious than a Server header in every response.
