NAME

    Mojolicious::Plugin::ForwardedFor - Retrieve the remote address from
    X-Forwarded-For

SYNOPSIS

      use Mojolicious::Lite;
      plugin ForwardedFor => {levels => 2}; # number of reverse proxies you control
      any '/' => sub {
        my $c = shift;
        $c->render(json => {remote_addr => $c->forwarded_for});
      };
      app->start;

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious supports deployment via a reverse proxy setup by specifying
    the proxy configuration option for Hypnotoad, or the MOJO_REVERSE_PROXY
    environment variable. However, "remote_address" in Mojo::Transaction
    will in this case only return the most recent address from the
    X-Forwarded-For header, as it cannot automatically determine how many
    remote addresses correspond to proxies.

    Mojolicious::Plugin::ForwardedFor can be configured with the number of
    reverse proxy "levels" that you control, and provides a "forwarded_for"
    helper method that will return the remote address at that level. It is
    important to set "levels" no higher than the number of proxies that
    will have appended addresses to the X-Forwarded-For header, as the
    original requests can pass anything as the initial value of the header,
    and thus spoof additional proxy levels.

HELPERS

    Mojolicious::Plugin::ForwardedFor implements the following helpers.

 forwarded_for

      my $remote_addr = $c->forwarded_for;

    Returns the least recently appended remote address from the
    X-Forwarded-For header, while skipping no more than the configured
    number of reverse proxy "levels". Returns the originating address of
    the current request if configured for 0 reverse proxy levels, or if no
    addresses have been appended to the header.

METHODS

    Mojolicious::Plugin::ForwardedFor inherits all methods from
    Mojolicious::Plugin and implements the following new ones.

 register

      $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new);
      $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new, {levels => 1});

    Register helper in Mojolicious application. Takes the following
    options:

    levels

      Number of remote proxy levels to allow for when parsing
      X-Forwarded-For. Defaults to the value of the MOJO_REVERSE_PROXY
      environment variable, or 1.
