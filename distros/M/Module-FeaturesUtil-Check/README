NAME
    Module::FeaturesUtil::Check - Check feature set specification and
    feature declaration (following Module::Features specification)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Module::FeaturesUtil::Check
    (from Perl distribution Module-FeaturesUtil-Check), released on
    2021-07-31.

DESCRIPTION
    See "GLOSSARY" in Module::Features for terminology.

FUNCTIONS
  check_feature_set_spec
    Usage:

     check_feature_set_spec($feature_set_spec) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check feature set specification.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   $feature_set_spec* => *hash*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  check_features_decl
    Usage:

     check_features_decl($features_decl) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check features declaration.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   $features_decl* => *hash*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.
