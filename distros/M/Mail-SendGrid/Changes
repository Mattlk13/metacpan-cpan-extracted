Revision history for Perl module Mail::SendGrid

0.09 2015-11-08
    - Switched from Mouse to Moo: I was requiring 0.94 of Mouse, but that
      was causing failures on old versions of Perl because recent releases
      of Mouse have version numbers with a leading 'v', eg 'v2.4.5'.
      See https://github.com/gfx/p5-Mouse/issues/55
