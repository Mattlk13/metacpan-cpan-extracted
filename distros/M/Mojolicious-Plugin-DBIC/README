Mojolicious::Plugin::DBIC

This plugin makes working with DBIx::Class easier in Mojolicious.

  Configuration

Configure your schema in multiple ways:

    # Just DSN
    plugin DBIC => {
        schema => {
            'MySchema' => 'DSN',
        },
    };

    # Arguments to connect()
    plugin DBIC => {
        schema => {
            'MySchema' => [ 'DSN', 'user', 'password', { RaiseError => 1 } ],
        },
    };

    # Connected schema object
    my $schema = MySchema->connect( ... );
    plugin DBIC => {
        schema => $schema,
    };

This plugin can also be configured from the application configuration
file:

    # myapp.conf
    {
        dbic => {
            schema => {
                'MySchema' => 'dbi:SQLite:data.db',
            },
        },
    }

    # myapp.pl
    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    plugin 'Config';
    plugin 'DBIC';

database operations. See Mojolicious::Plugin::DBIC::Controller::DBIC.
