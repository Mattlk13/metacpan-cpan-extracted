DESCRIPTION
    This module is a temporary alternative to
    MooX::Role::Parameterized::With and provides "with" keyword. In addition
    to that, this module can include Role::Tiny and regular non-parametric
    Moo::Role roles.

SYNOPSYS
    In MyRole1.pm:

        package Role1; # a Role::Tiny role
        use Role::Tiny;
        sub meth1 { ... }
        1;

    In MyRole2.pm:

        package Role2; # a Moo::Role role
        use Moo::Role;
        sub meth2 { ... }
        1;

    In MyRole3.pm:

        package MyRole3; # a parameterized Moo::Role role
        use MooX::Role::Parameterized;
        role {
            my ($params, $mop) = @_;
            $mop->method($params->{name} => sub {...});
        };
        1;

    In MyClass.pm, which uses the roles:

        package MyClass;
        use MooX::Role::Parameterized::With::Keyword;
        with 'MyRole1', 'MyRole2', 'MyRole3' => {name => 'meth3_blah'};

    In script.pl, which uses the class:

        use MyClass;
        my $obj = MyClass->new;
        $obj->meth1;
        $obj->meth2;
        $obj->meth3_blah;
