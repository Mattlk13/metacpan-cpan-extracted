Mail-SSLSigCheck
----------------

What is Mail::SSLSigCheck
-------------------------

Mail::SSLSigCheck is an email filter, similar in nature to Apache's
Mail::SpamAssassin. Each email message passed through it will be checked
for an SSL signature. If an SSL signature is found, the signing certificate
and its issuer will be compared against a user configurable store of
user and CA (Certificate Authority) certificates. The results of these
checks and comparisons will be recorded in the email message as extra
headers. These headers can be examined to redirect incoming messages using
a program like the included sslsigcheck.

This module is still in development.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SSL Certificate Stores
----------------------

The first time the filter is executed, the following directories
and files will be created if they do not already exist.

$USER_HOME/.sslsigcheck/cacerts/trustedcacerts.pem
$USER_HOME/.sslsigcheck/cacerts/untrustedcacerts.pem
$USER_HOME/.sslsigcheck/usercerts/trustedcacerts.pem
$USER_HOME/.sslsigcheck/usercerts/untrustedcacerts.pem

The .pem files will contain the PEM versions of SSL certificates.
Future versions may use an SQLite DB.
