Markup-Perl version 0.01
========================

The first inspiration for this module was a total revulsion for seeing (writing, maintaining, debugging, etc etc) HTML inside print statements in CGI scripts. How far will I go to avoid such things? The answer is Markup::Perl.

The second inspiration was Dag Ågren's PerlHP module, which made me realize I could have my Perl and template-like syntax too. But, you say, there are so many great perl-based templating systems already! Why not Mason, or Template Toolkit or [insert favorite here]?

Well, I've tried those. They truly are great. Their popularity certainly proves that there is a desire for such things. My only problem was I already filled my entire brain with Perl. There simply wasn't room for any new invented mini-syntax, or complicated configuration information.

Markup::Perl's raison d'être is simplicity. It purposely _doesn't_ do all the singing and dancing those other guys do. It's just perl, tagged with a <perl> tag, and then it works. One file, about 50 lines of code, and you're over a learning curve that was essentially flat. And, because it is "just perl", that's quite enough for nearly every purpose you can think up.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module is best used in a CGI environment, so it naturally includes the CGI.pm module. In addition it wouldn't work without the magic of Filter::Simple. Both of these are already included as standard in recent distributions.

BUGS

Achieving security is an unending job and I'm the first to admit there are always things that could be improved. That's the beauty of open-source, though and I'm anxious for your participation and feedback on how Markup::Perl could be better, stronger, faster. Possibly even bionic...
