NAME
    Module::Features::PluginSystem - Features of modules that generate text
    tables

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Module::Features::PluginSystem
    (from Perl distribution Module-Features-PluginSystem), released on
    2024-03-17.

DESCRIPTION
    Glossary

    *Hook*: a named execution point where plugins' handlers get the chance
    to add behaviors.

    *Plugin*: a code packaged in a Perl module that contains extra behaviors
    in one or more of /handler/s.

    *Handler*: A subroutine (or method) in a /plugin/ that will get called
    in a /hook/.

    *Priority*: a number between 0 and 100 signifying the order of execution
    of a handler compared to handlers for the same hook from other plugins.
    Lower number means a higher priority (executed first). Default priority
    if unspecified is 50.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
