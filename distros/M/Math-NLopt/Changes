Revision history for Math-NLopt

0.04      2024-12-19 22:20:41-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * $opt->last-optimize_result was incorrect if ->optimize resulted
      in a negative result code

    * the user data structure passed via e.g. set_min_objective, wasn't
      properly tracked, leading to the possibility that it could
      be destroyed before the NLopt objective method was called,
      causing hilarity when the user's object method was invoked.


  [TEST]

    * comparing iteration counts is too noisy; ignore them in tests
