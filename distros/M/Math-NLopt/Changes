  [BUG FIX]

    * $opt->last-optimize_result was incorrect if ->optimize resulted
      in a negative result code

    * the user data structure passed via e.g. set_min_objective, wasn't
      properly tracked, leading to the possibility that it could
      be destroyed before the NLopt objective method was called,
      causing hilarity when the user's object method was invoked.
