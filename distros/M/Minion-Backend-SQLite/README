NAME

    Minion::Backend::SQLite - SQLite backend for Minion job queue

SYNOPSIS

      use Minion::Backend::SQLite;
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new('sqlite:test.db');
    
      # Minion
      use Minion;
      my $minion = Minion->new(SQLite => 'sqlite:test.db');
    
      # Mojolicious (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
      $self->plugin(Minion => { SQLite => 'sqlite:test.db' });
    
      # Mojolicious::Lite (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
      plugin Minion => { SQLite => 'sqlite:test.db' };
    
      # Share the database connection cache
      helper sqlite => sub { state $sqlite = Mojo::SQLite->new('sqlite:test.db') };
      plugin Minion => { SQLite => app->sqlite };

DESCRIPTION

    Minion::Backend::SQLite is a backend for Minion based on Mojo::SQLite.
    All necessary tables will be created automatically with a set of
    migrations named minion. If no connection string or :temp: is provided,
    the database will be created in a temporary directory.

ATTRIBUTES

    Minion::Backend::SQLite inherits all attributes from Minion::Backend
    and implements the following new ones.

 dequeue_interval

      my $seconds = $backend->dequeue_interval;
      $backend    = $backend->dequeue_interval($seconds);

    Interval in seconds between "dequeue" attempts. Defaults to 0.5.

 sqlite

      my $sqlite = $backend->sqlite;
      $backend   = $backend->sqlite(Mojo::SQLite->new);

    Mojo::SQLite object used to store all data.

METHODS

    Minion::Backend::SQLite inherits all methods from Minion::Backend and
    implements the following new ones.

 new

      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new;
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new(':temp:');
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new('sqlite:test.db');
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new->tap(sub { $_->sqlite->from_filename('C:\\foo\\bar.db') });
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new(Mojo::SQLite->new);

    Construct a new Minion::Backend::SQLite object.

 broadcast

      my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command');
      my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args]);
      my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args], [$id1, $id2, $id3]);

    Broadcast remote control command to one or more workers.

 dequeue

      my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5);
      my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5, {queues => ['important']});

    Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue it and
    transition from inactive to active state, or return undef if queues
    were empty. Jobs will be checked for in intervals defined by
    "dequeue_interval" until the timeout is reached.

    These options are currently available:

    id

        id => '10023'

      Dequeue a specific job.

    queues

        queues => ['important']

      One or more queues to dequeue jobs from, defaults to default.

    These fields are currently available:

    args

        args => ['foo', 'bar']

      Job arguments.

    id

        id => '10023'

      Job ID.

    retries

        retries => 3

      Number of times job has been retried.

    task

        task => 'foo'

      Task name.

 enqueue

      my $job_id = $backend->enqueue('foo');
      my $job_id = $backend->enqueue(foo => [@args]);

    Enqueue a new job with inactive state.

    These options are currently available:

    attempts

        attempts => 25

      Number of times performing this job will be attempted, with a delay
      based on "backoff" in Minion after the first attempt, defaults to 1.

      transitioned to the state finished before it can be processed.

    priority

      Job priority, defaults to 0. Jobs with a higher priority get
      performed first.

    there are attempts remaining, transition back to inactive with an
    exponentially increasing delay based on "backoff" in Minion.
