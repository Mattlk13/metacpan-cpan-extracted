Revision history for Music::Guidonian

0.05    July  5 2021
        Remove references to Test::More (Test2::V0 is instead used).

0.03    July  3 2021
        Allow use of Music::PitchNum to convert numbers to note names.
        'renew' of undef turns that feature off. Change return value of
        generated function when out of possibilities. More tests.

0.02    July  2 2021
        Add 'renew' parameter so that the caller can specify how the
        choices are set at first or after all their values have been
        worked through.

0.01    July  1 2021
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
