MIDI-XML version 0.03
=====================

MIDI-XML is a suite of Perl modules that provide the capability to convert 
MIDI files to XML and XML to MIDI files.  It builds on the foundation provided
by MIDI-Perl which provides the capability to read and write MIDI files.  This
release provides the ability to read and write MidiXML files and to import and 
export standard MIDI files. 

MIDI-XML also provides built-in collections of the the various MIDI events and
derivable collections, such as measures.

MIDI-XML-Editor has been added which, although primitive at this time, will 
be the focus of my improvements.
