NAME
    Method::Signatures::PP - EXPERIMENTAL pure perl method keyword

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Test::More;
        use Method::Signatures::PP;
    
        package Wat;
    
        use Moo;
    
        method foo {
          "FOO from ".ref($self);
        }
    
        method bar ($arg) {
          "WOOO $arg";
        }
    
        package main;
    
        my $wat = Wat->new;
    
        is($wat->foo, 'FOO from Wat', 'Parenless method');
    
        is($wat->bar('BAR'), 'WOOO BAR', 'Method w/argument');
    
        done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
    It's ... a method keyword.

        method foo { ... }

    is equivalent to

        sub foo { my $self = shift; ... }

    and

        method bar ($arg) { ... }

    is equivalent to

        method bar ($arg) { my $self = shift; my ($arg) = @_; ... }

    In fact, it isn't just equivalent, this module literally rewrites the
    source code in the way shown in the examples above. It does so by using
    a source filter (boo, hiss, yes I know) to slurp the entire file, then
    Damian's wonderfully insane PPR module to parse the code to find the
    keywords, and then rewrites the source before returning the file to perl
    to compile.

    The wonderful part of this is that it's 100% pure perl and therefore
    unlike every other method implementation is amenable to App::FatPacker
    use. The terrible part of this is that if the parse phase doesn't work,
    the code has no idea at all what it's doing and ends up not touching the
    source code at all, at which point the compilation failures from the
    keyword rewriting not having happened will almost certainly hide the
    actual problem.

    So, for the moment, you are strongly advised to not use this module
    while developing code, and instead use Function::Parameters if you have
    a not completely ancient perl and Method::Signatures::Simple if you're
    still back in the stone age banging rocks together, and to then switch
    your 'use' line to this module for fatpacking/shipping/etc. - I may yet
    come up with a better solution to this and/or beg Damian for help doing
    so, but at the time of writing I can offer no guarantees.

    Note that PPR requires perl 5.10 and as such so does this module.
    However, if you need to support older perls, you can

        use Method::Signatures::PP::Compile;

    which uses ingy's Module::Compile to generate a .pmc file that should
    run fine on whatever version of perl the rest of your code requires.
    This will likely be rewritten to use a slightly less lunatic compilation
    mechanism in later releases.
