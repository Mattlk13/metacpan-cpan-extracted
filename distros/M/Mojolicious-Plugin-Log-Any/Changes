v1.0.1    2020-03-31 12:51:35 EDT
  - Avoid stringifying message when passed as a single reference with
    prepend_level false, such as when logging exception objects.

v1.0.0    2019-08-12 18:44:18 EDT
  - Add prepend_level option to attach_logger and plugin to allow disabling the
    prepending of the log level to messages (#2)

0.005     2018-12-05 00:33:32 EST
  - Fix tests to not rely on shorthand for applying role
  - Mojolicious 8.06 changed Mojo::Log to not send the 'message' event when a
    log message would be filtered by the log level, so the plugin now explicitly
    sets the application log level to 'debug' to preserve the old (documented)
    behavior of always forwarding to the attached logger

  - Require Log::Any 1.00 for Log::Any testing

0.003     2018-02-06 14:05:06 EST
  - Require Log::Contextual 0.008001 when attaching it as a logger
  - Import slog_ functions individually from Log::Contextual

0.002     2017-12-05 02:28:09 EST
  - Quick breaking change: Unsubscribe the default message handler in the
    plugin, not the role

0.001     2017-12-05 02:03:16 EST
  - First release
