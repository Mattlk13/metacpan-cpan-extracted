NAME
    Module::Features::PerlTrove - Put Perl trove classifiers in your module

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Module::Features::PerlTrove
    (from Perl distribution Module-Features-PerlTrove), released on
    2021-04-02.

SYNOPSIS
    To add Perl trove classifiers in your module, just define %FEATURES
    variable:

     package YourModule;
     #ABSTRACT: An App::Cmd application to highlight Indonesian words in text

     our %FEATURES = (
         features => {
             PerlTrove => {
                 "Development Status" => "3 - Alpha",

                 "Framework" => "App::Cmd",

                 "Intended Audience" => "Developers",

                 "License" => [
                     "OSI Approved :: Artistic License",
                     "OSI Approved :: GNU General Public License v2 or later (GPLv2+)",
                 ],

                 "Natural Language" => "Indonesian",

                 "Programming Language" => "Perl",

                 "Environment" => "Console",

                 "Topic" => [
                     "Software Development :: Libraries :: Perl Modules",
                     "Text Processing :: Linguistic",
                     "Utilities",
                 ],
             },

             # other features you might want to define
             # ...
         },
     };

    To check whether your classifiers are valid (does not contain unknown
    classifiers), you can use check-module-features from
    App::ModuleFeaturesUtils:

     % check-module-features YourModule

    To see the trove classifiers, you can use get-features-decl from
    App::ModuleFeaturesUtils:

     % get-features-decl YourModule

    There are other ways to read the trove classifiers, including accessing
    the %FEATURES variable directly.

DESCRIPTION
    Perl trove classifiers are based on Python ones. Currently the only
    difference is that the Python-specific framework classifiers in
    "Framework :: *", e.g. "Framework :: Django", are replaced with
    Perl-specific ones, e.g. "Framework :: Dancer2".
