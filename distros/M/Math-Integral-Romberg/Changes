Math::Integral::Romberg - Numeric integration of single-variable functions

This Perl package numerically integrates single-variable functions
over a finite interval using the Romberg method.  It takes a
reference to a function, the two limit values, and various optional
error thresholds, and returns the area of the function between those
two points.

Version 0.02 allows the convergence parameters (e.g. absolute and
relative tolerances) to be set using package variables as well as
optional parameters. The default values have also been made less
stringent.  (Doug Burke)

Version 0.03 -- same as 0.02, but with tests and updated packaging.
