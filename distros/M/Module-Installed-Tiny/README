SYNOPSIS

     use Module::Installed::Tiny qw(module_installed module_source);
    
     # check if a module is available
     if (module_installed "Foo::Bar") {
         # Foo::Bar is available
     } elsif (module_installed "Foo/Baz.pm") {
         # Foo::Baz is available
     }
    
     # get a module's source code, dies on failure
     my $src = module_source("Foo/Baz.pm");

DESCRIPTION

    To check if a module is installed (available), generally the simplest
    way is to try to require() it:

     if (eval { require Foo::Bar; 1 }) {
         # Foo::Bar is available
     }

    However, this actually loads the module. There are some cases where
    this is not desirable: 1) we have to check a lot of modules (actually
    loading the modules will take a lot of CPU time and memory; 2) some of
    the modules conflict with one another and cannot all be loaded; 3) the
    module is OS specific and might not load under another OS; 4) we simply
    do not want to execute the module, for security or other reasons.

    Module::Installed::Tiny provides a routine module_installed() which
    works like Perl's require but does not actually load the module.

    This module does not require any other module except Exporter.

FUNCTIONS

 module_installed($name) => bool

    Check that module named $name is available to load. This means that:
    either the module file exists on the filesystem and searchable in @INC
    and the contents of the file can be retrieved, or when there is a
    require hook in @INC, the module's source can be retrieved from the
    hook.

    Note that this does not guarantee that the module can eventually be
    loaded successfully, as there might be syntax or runtime errors in the
    module's source. To check for that, one would need to actually load the
    module using require.

 module_source($name) => str

    Return module's source code, without actually loading it. Die on
    failure.

SEE ALSO

    Module::Load::Conditional provides check_install which also does what
    module_installed does, plus can check module version. It also has a
    couple other knobs to customize its behavior. It's less tiny than
    Module::Installed::Tiny though.

    Module::Path and Module::Path::More. These modules can also be used to
    check if a module on the filesystem is available. They do not handle
    require hooks, nor do they actually check that the module file is
    readable.
