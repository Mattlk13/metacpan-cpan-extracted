VERSION

    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

    This is an extension of the Starman server that can be run via Starman
    by specifying the server Martian. It allows the server to kill the
    processes when they use too much memory. This is done between requests
    so that the web server isn't interrupted. This is similar to the max
    requests parameter.

        starman phoenix-ui-admin.psgi --listen :5001 --server Martian --memory-limit 10000

    The memory figure relates to the processes 'maximum shared memory or
    current resident set' which shows up in top/htop as RES. The figure is
    in KiB.
