SYNOPSIS

     % PERL5OPT=-MModule::Path::More::Patch::Hide=-module,'Foo::Bar;Baz' app.pl

    In the above example app.pl will think that Foo::Bar and Baz are not
    installed even though they might actually be installed.

DESCRIPTION

    This module can be used to simulate the absence of certain modules.
    This only works if the application uses Module::Path::More's
    module_path() to check the availability of modules.

    This module works by patching module_path() to return empty result if
    user asks the modules that happen to be hidden.

append:SEE ALSO

    If the application checks he availability of modules by actually trying
    to require() them, you can try: lib::filter, lib::disallow.
