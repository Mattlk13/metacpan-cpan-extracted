NAME

    Mojo::DB::Role::ResultsRoles - Apply roles to Mojo database results

SYNOPSIS

      use Mojo::Pg;
      my $pg = Mojo::Pg->new(...)->with_roles('Mojo::DB::Role::ResultsRoles');
      push @{$pg->results_roles}, 'Mojo::DB::Results::Role::Something';
      my $results = $pg->db->query(...);
      # $results does Mojo::DB::Results::Role::Something

DESCRIPTION

    This role allows roles to be applied to the results objects returned by
    Mojo::Pg or similar database APIs. The manager object must create
    database connections via a db method, which must have a results_class
    attribute used to instantiate results objects.

ATTRIBUTES

    Mojo::DB::Role::ResultsRoles composes the following attributes.

 results_roles

      my $roles = $manager->results_roles;
      $manager  = $manager->results_roles(\@roles);

    Array reference of roles to compose into results objects. This only
    affects database objects created by subsequent calls to the db method.
