Mac-FindFile

This module allows you to search a Mac hard drive or volume using the native FSCatalogSearch API. This API, not related to the Mac's Spotlight system, does a fast search through the file system's indexed catalog, and can search an entire hard drive in seconds (as opposed to several minutes for a directory walk such as File::Find).

    use Mac::FindFile;

    Mac::FindFile::find("png", "/");


Because the search output can be quite large, it is written to a fixed location ("/tmp/mac_findfile_output.txt") so that it can be managed more easily. The file can be read into memory, or loaded more quickly with a module such as Tie::File. 

     use Tie::File;
     my @searchoutput;
     tie @searchoutput, 'Tie::File', '/tmp/mac_findfile_output.txt' or die; 

     foreach (@searchoutput) {
     print "this item is $_\n";
     }

     untie @searchoutput;
