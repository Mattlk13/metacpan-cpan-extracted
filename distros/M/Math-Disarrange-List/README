Name
    Math::Disarrange::List - Generate all the disarrangements of a list.

Synopsis
     use Math::Disarrange::List;

     disarrange {say "@_"} qw(a b c);

     #  c a b
     #  b c a

Description
    Generate and process all the disarrangements of a list using the
    standard Perl metaphor. A disarrangement is a permutation of the
    original list in which no element is in its original position.

    "disarrange()" returns the number of disarrangements in both scalar and
    array context.

    "disarrange()" is easy to use and fast. It is written in 100% Pure Perl.

    Please note that the order in which the disarrangements are generated is
    not guaranteed, so please do not rely on it.

Export
    The "disarrange()" function is exported.

Installation
    Standard Module::Build process for building and installing modules:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
    the "./" notation, you can do this:

      perl Build.PL
      Build
      Build test
      Build install
