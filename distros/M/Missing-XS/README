NAME
    Missing::XS - print warnings about XS modules you should probably install

SYNOPSIS
      perl -Missing::XS "path/to/your/script.pl"

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an `END {}` block which will run *after* your script
    and print warnings about modules your script used which are being forced
    to use their pure Perl backend instead of a faster XS backend which is
    available on CPAN.

    For example, if your script loads Package::Stash but you don't have
    Package::Stash::XS installed, then you will see a warning.

    The following will provide a quick copy-and-paste command for installing
    the missing XS modules with `cpanm`:

      perl -Missing::XS=cpanm "path/to/your/script.pl"

ENVIRONMENT
    The `PERL_MISSING_XS_NO_END` environment variable suppresses the printing
    of the warnings in the `END {}` block.
