=head1 NAME

Module::Format::AsHTML - generate HTML links to metacpan module/dists pages.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Module::Format::AsHTML ();
    my $cpan = Module::Format::AsHTML->new();

    $html .= $cpan->self_mod({ 'm'=> "Path::Tiny"});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module::Format::AsHTML is a module to generate HTML hyperlinks and other HTML fragments
for CPAN modules and distributions.

It grew out of some incarnations of source codes used by some
of my (= SHLOMIF) sites.

One for example can pass:

    'cpan'Â => Module::Format::AsHTML->new(),

As a variable to L<https://metacpan.org/release/Template-Toolkit> and then use it
in templates:

    [% cpan.self_mod('m'=>"List::Util") %]

=head1 SECURITY WARNING!

This module does not validate or sanitize its input and so may be susceptible to
HTML injection / XSS issues (see L<https://perl-begin.org/topics/security/code-markup-injection/> ).
This is expected given its origin as utility code for generating static sites.

Please do not use it with input from possibly malicious sources or without sanitising it.
In the future, this issue may be fixed.
