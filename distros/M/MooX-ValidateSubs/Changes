1.012002 19/11/2017
		This morning a Python colleague told me I can't do these things in perl 
		- Allow for override of indexed defaults "2='okay'" - will set the third passed argument into the sub - current caveats here are
			- Arguments need to be stringified so for a hashref you will need - "2={ one => 'two' }".
			- Passing a stringified Object will not currently work (logic only caters for ArrayRefs, HashRefs and Strings).
		- setting a keys arrayref allows you to pass in a **dict** and transform it into a list with controlled order.

1.012003 19/11/2017
		Aparently I was in a special mood this morning no caveats - no stringification of indexed params. Everything should work.
