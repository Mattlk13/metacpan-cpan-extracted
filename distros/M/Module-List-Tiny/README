NAME
    Module::List::Tiny - A fork of Module::List that starts faster

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004001 of Module::List::Tiny (from
    Perl distribution Module-List-Tiny), released on 2019-09-02.

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::List::Tiny qw(list_modules);

     $id_modules = list_modules("Data::ID::", { list_modules => 1});
     $prefixes = list_modules("", { list_prefixes => 1, recurse => 1 });

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a fork of Module::List. It's exactly like Module::List
    0.004, except with lower startup overhead (see benchmarks in
    Bencher::Scenarios::ListingModules::Startup). To accomplish this, it:

    *   does its own exporting instead of using Exporter

    *   avoids using Carp and uses the good old "die"

    *   avoids using IO::Dir and uses plain "opendir"

        The problem is that IO::Dir brings in a bunch of other modules.

    *   avoids using File::Spec and hard-code path separator as "/"

        "/" happens to work everywhere with current platforms anyway.
