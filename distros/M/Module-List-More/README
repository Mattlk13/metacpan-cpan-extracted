NAME
    Module::List::More - Module::List, with more options

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004011 of Module::List::More (from
    Perl distribution Module-List-More), released on 2022-08-12.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would Module::List, e.g.:

     use Module::List::More qw(list_modules);

     $id_modules = list_modules("Data::ID::", { list_modules=>1, return_path=>1, return_library_path=>1, return_version=>1});
     # Sample result:
     # {
     #   'Data::ID::One' => {
     #     module_path=>"/home/s1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.2/lib/site_perl/5.30.2/Data/ID/One.pm",
     #     library_path=>"/home/s1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.2/lib/site_perl/5.30.2",
     #     module_version=>'0.01',
     #   },
     #   'Data::ID::Two' => {
     #     module_path=>"/home/s1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.2/lib/site_perl/5.30.2/Data/ID/Two.pm",
     #     library_path=>"/home/s1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.2/lib/site_perl/5.30.2",
     #     module_version=>'0.02',
     #   },
     # }

     {
       local @INC = ('lib', @INC);
       $id_modules = list_modules("Data::ID::", { list_modules=>1, all=>1, return_path=>1, return_version=>1});
     }
     # Sample result:
     # {
     #   'Data::ID::One' => {
     #     module_path=>["lib/Data/ID/One.pm", "/home/s1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.2/lib/site_perl/5.30.2/Data/ID/One.pm"],
     #     module_version=>[undef, '0.01'],
     #   },
     #   'Data::ID::Two' => {
     #     module_path=>["/home/s1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.2/lib/site_perl/5.30.2/Data/ID/Two.pm"],
     #     module_version=>['0.02'],
     #   },
     # }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is like Module::List, except for the following differences:

    *   lower startup overhead (with some caveats)

        It avoids using Exporter and implements its own import(). It avoids
        IO::Dir, Carp, File::Spec, with the goal of saving a few
        milliseconds (a casual test on my PC results in 11ms vs 39ms).

        Path separator is hard-coded as "/".

    *   Recognize "all" option

        If set to true and "return_path" is also set to true, will return
        all found paths for each module instead of just the first found one.
        The values of result will be an arrayref containing all found paths.

    *   Recognize "return_library_path" option

        If set to true, will return a "library_path" result key, which is
        the associated @INC entry that produces the result.

    *   Recognize "return_version" option

        If set to true, will parse module source file with
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker's "parse_version" and return the result in
        "module_version" key. If version cannot be detected, a proper
        undefined value "undef" (instead of the string 'undef') is returned.

    *   Recognize "wildcard" option

        This boolean option can be set to true to recognize wildcard pattern
        in prefix. Wildcard patterns such as jokers ("?", "*", "**"),
        classes ("[a-z]"), as well as braces ("{One,Two}") are supported.
        "**" implies recursive listing (sets "recurse" option to 1).

        Examples:

         list_modules("Module::P*", {wildcard=>1, list_modules=>1});

        results in something like:

         {
             "Module::Patch"             => undef,
             "Module::Path"              => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable"         => undef,
         }

        while:

         list_modules("Module::P**", {wildcard=>1, list_modules=>1});

        results in something like:

         {
             "Module::Patch"             => undef,
             "Module::Path"              => undef,
             "Module::Path::More"        => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable"         => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable::Object" => undef,
         }

        while:

         list_modules("Module::**le", {wildcard=>1, list_modules=>1});

        results in something like:

         {
             "Module::Depakable"                => undef,
             "Module::Install::Admin::Bundle"   => undef,
             "Module::Install::Admin::Makefile" => undef,
             "Module::Install::Bundle"          => undef,
             "Module::Install::Makefile"        => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable"                => undef,
         }

    *   Recognize c<ls_mode> option

        This makes "list_modules()" behave more like Unix ls utility. When
        given prefix e.g. "strict" then it will search from the root
        namespace instead of from "strict::" thus finding "strict.pm"
        itself. When given prefix e.g. "Module::List" it will start search
        in the "Module::" namespace instead of "Module::List::" thus finding
        "Module::List" itself.

        However, given "strict::" or "Module::List::" will force search from
        that namespace.

SEE ALSO
    Module::List

    Module::List::Tiny

    Module::List::Wildcard is spun off from this module with the main
    feature of wildcard. I might deprecate one of the modules in the future,
    but currently I maintain both.

HISTORY
    This module began its life as PERLANCAR::Module::List, my personal
    experimental fork of Module::List. The experiment has also produced
    other forks like Module::List::Tiny, Module::List::Wildcard.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
