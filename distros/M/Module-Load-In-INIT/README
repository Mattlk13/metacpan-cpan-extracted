NAME
    Module::Load::In::INIT - Load modules in INIT phase

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Module::Load::In::INIT (from
    Perl distribution Module-Load-In-INIT), released on 2018-01-15.

SYNOPSIS
    In the command-line:

     % perl -MModule::Load::In::INIT=Mod::One,Mod::Two='Some;Import;Args' somescript.pl

    "Mod::One" and "Mod::Two" will be loaded in the INIT phase instead of
    BEGIN phase.

    Specify options for Module::Load::In::INIT itself:

     % perl -MModule::Load::In::INIT=-ignore_load_error,Mod::One,Mod::Two

DESCRIPTION
    This module can load (or perhaps defer loading) modules in the INIT
    phase instead of the BEGIN phase. One use-case where it is useful:
    monkey-patching a module (using a Module::Patch-based module) in a
    fatpacked script (see Module::FatPack or App::FatPacker), e.g.:

     % perl -MSome::Module::Patch::Foo fatpacked-script.pl

    "Some::Module::Patch::Foo" will try to load "Some::Module" then patch
    it. This might fail when module is loaded by the fatpack handler (which
    is a require hook) as by the time "Some::Module::Patch::Foo" is loaded,
    the fatpack handler has not been setup yet, and "Some::Module" is not
    available elsewhere (on the filesystem). This, however, works:

     % perl -MModule::Load::In::INIT=Some::Module::Patch::Foo fatpacked-script.pl

    Loading of "Some::Module::Patch::Foo" (and by extension, "Some::Module")
    is deferred to the INIT phase. By that time, the fatpack require hook
    has been setup and "Some::Module" can be (or might already be) loaded by
    it.

    Caveat: Module::Load::In::INIT itself must be loaded in the BEGIN phase,
    or INIT phase at the latest.

OPTIONS
    You can specify options for Module::Load::In::INIT itself via import
    argument that starts with dash ("-"). Known options:

    -ignore_load_error
        If set, then require() error will be ignored.
