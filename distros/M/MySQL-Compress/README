MySQL::Compress
===============

Description
-----------
This module provides functions compatible with MySQL COMPRESS() and UNCOMPRESS().
One reason you may want to use these functions is because MySQL COMPRESS() does not offer the possibilty
to specify the compression level, whereas the mysql_compress() function in this module does.
