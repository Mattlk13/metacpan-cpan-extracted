Name
    Math::Permute::Partitions - Generate all the permutations of a
    partitioned list.

Synopsis
     use Math::Permute::Partitions;

     permutePartitions {$a .= "@_\n"} [1,2], [3,4];

     # 1 2 3 4
     # 1 2 4 3
     # 2 1 3 4
     # 2 1 4 3

Description
    Generate all the permutations of a partitioned list using the standard
    Perl metaphor.

    "permutePartitions()" returns the number of permutations in both scalar
    and array context.

    "permutePartitions()" is written in 100% Pure Perl.

Export
    The "permutePartitions()" function is exported.

Installation
    Standard Module::Build process for building and installing modules:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
    the "./" notation, you can do this:

      perl Build.PL
      Build
      Build test
      Build install
