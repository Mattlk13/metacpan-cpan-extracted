Name
    Math::Subsets::List - Generate all the subsets of a list.

Synopsis
     use Math::Subsets::List;

     subsets {say "@_"} qw(a b c);

     #    
     #  a 
     #  b
     #  c
     #  a b 
     #  a c 
     #  b c
     #  a b c

Description
    Generate all the subsets of a list and process them using the standard
    Perl metaphor.

    "subsets()" returns the number of subsets. Please note that this
    includes the empty set as it is a subset of all sets.

    Please note that the order in which the subsets are generated is not
    guaranteed, so please do not rely on it.

    "subsets()" is easy to use and fast. It is written in 100% Pure Perl.

Export
    The "subsets()" function is exported.

Installation
    Standard Module::Build process for building and installing modules:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
    the "./" notation, you can do this:

      perl Build.PL
      Build
      Build test
      Build install
