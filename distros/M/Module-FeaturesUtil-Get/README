NAME
    Module::FeaturesUtil::Get - Get a feature from a module (following
    Module::Features specification)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of Module::FeaturesUtil::Get (from
    Perl distribution Module-FeaturesUtil-Get), released on 2021-07-31.

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::FeaturesUtil::Get qw(
         get_features_decl
         get_feature_val
         module_declares_feature
     );

     # Get features declaration:
     my $features_decl = get_features_decl('Text::Table::Tiny');

     # Get value of a feature:
     if (!get_feature_val('Text::Table::Tiny', 'TextTable', 'align_cell_containing_color_codes')) {
         # strip color codes first
         for ($str1, $str2) { s/\e\[[0-9;]+m/sg }
     }
     push @rows, [$str1, $str2];

     # Check whether a module declares a feature:
     if (module_declares_feature('Text::Table::Tiny', 'TextTable', 'speed')) {
        ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    See "GLOSSARY" in Module::Features for terminology.

FUNCTIONS
  get_feature_set_spec
    Usage:

     my $feature_set_spec = get_feature_set_spec($feature_set_name);

    Feature set specification will be retrieved from the
    "Module::Features::$feature_set_name" module. The module will NOT be
    loaded by this routine; you will need to load the module yourself.

    This module will also NOT check the validity of feature set
    specification.

  get_features_decl
    Usage:

     my $features_decl = get_features_decl($module_name);

    Features declaration is first looked up from proxy module's %FEATURES
    package variable, then from the module's %FEATURES. Proxy module is
    $module_name*::_ModuleFeatures*. You have to load the modules yourself;
    this routine will not load the modules for you.

    This routine will also NOT check the validity of features declaration.

  get_feature_val
    Usage:

     my $val = get_feature_val($module_name, $feature_set_name, $feature_name);

    Example:

     if (!get_feature_val('Text::Table::Tiny', 'TextTable', 'align_cell_containing_color_codes')) {
         # strip color codes first
         for ($str1, $str2) { s/\e\[[0-9;]+m/sg }
     }
     push @rows, [$str1, $str2];

    Get the value of a feature from a module's features declaration.

    Features declaration is retrieved using "get_features_decl".

    This routine will also NOT check the validity of feature value against
    the specification's schema.

  module_declares_feature
    Usage:

     my $bool = module_declares_feature($module_name, $feature_set_name, $feature_name);

    Check whether module declares a feature.

    Features declaration is retrieved using "get_features_decl".

    This routine will also NOT check the feature set specification.

    Module::Features

    This module does not check whether a feature declaration is valid or
    whether a feature set specification is valid. To do that, use
    Module::FeaturesUtil::Check's "check_features_decl" and
    "check_feature_set_spec".
