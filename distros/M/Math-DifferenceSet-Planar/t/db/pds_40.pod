=head1 NAME

pds_40.db - larger database with planar difference set samples

=head1 VERSION

This is version 0.9 of the database, created on August 30, 2019.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is a slightly larger sample database only used for testing.

It contains 40 cyclic planar difference sets with orders ranging from
2 to 113.  The sets are generated from Conway polynomials.

=head1 FILE FORMAT

SQLite 3.x database.

=head1 SCHEMA

  CREATE TABLE difference_set (
    order_   integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    base     integer NOT NULL,
    exponent integer NOT NULL,
    modulus  integer NOT NULL,
    n_planes integer NOT NULL,
    deltas   text    NOT NULL
  );

=head1 DATA REPRESENTATION

If I<D = { d_1, d_2, ..., d_k } (mod m)> is a canonical cyclic planar
difference set of order I<k - 1> with I<d_1 E<8801> 0> and
I<d_1 E<8801> 1 (mod m)>, I<deltas> is a string with I<k - 2> numeric
values separated by blanks, calculated as differences of consecutive
residue values of I<D> starting with I<d_3 - d_2>.  The difference of
the smallest two values in a canonical set is always 1 and thus not
important to store.
