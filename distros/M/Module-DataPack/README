NAME
    Module::DataPack - Like Module::FatPack, but uses datapacking instead of
    fatpack

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.222 of Module::DataPack (from Perl
    distribution Module-DataPack), released on 2021-08-29.

FUNCTIONS
  datapack_modules
    Usage:

     datapack_modules(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Like Module::FatPack, but uses datapacking instead of fatpack.

    Both this module and "Module:FatPack" generate source code that embeds
    modules' source codes and load them on-demand via require hook. The
    difference is that the modules' source codes are put in "__DATA__"
    section instead of regular Perl hashes (fatpack uses %fatpacked). This
    reduces compilation overhead, although this is not noticeable unless
    when the number of embedded modules is quite large. For example, in
    "App::pause", the "pause" script embeds ~320 modules with a total of
    ~54000 lines. The overhead of fatpack code is ~49ms on my PC, while with
    datapack the overhead is about ~10ms.

    There are two downsides of this technique. The major one is that you
    cannot load modules during BEGIN phase (e.g. using "use") because at
    that point, DATA section is not yet available. You can only use run-time
    require()'s.

    Another downside of this technique is that you cannot use "__DATA__"
    section for other purposes (well, actually with some care, you still
    can).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   module_names => *array[str]*

        Module names to search.

    *   module_srcs => *hash*

        Module source codes (a hash, keys are module names).

    *   output => *str*

        Output filename.

    *   overwrite => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to overwrite output if previously exists.

    *   postamble => *str*

        Perl source code to add after the datapack code (but before the
        __DATA__ section).

    *   preamble => *str*

        Perl source code to add before the datapack code.

    *   put_hook_at_the_end => *bool*

        Put the require hook at the end of @INC using "push" instead of at
        the front using "unshift".

    *   stripper => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to strip included modules using Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_comment => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set strip_comment=1 (strip comments) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_log => *bool* (default: 0)

        Set strip_log=1 (strip log statements) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_maintain_linum => *bool* (default: 0)

        Set maintain_linum=1 in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_pod => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set strip_pod=1 (strip POD) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_ws => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set strip_ws=1 (strip whitespace) in Perl::Stripper.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_DATAPACKER_DEBUG
    Boolean. When set to true, the datapacker @INC hook will print debug
    messages.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
