NAME
    Module::List::Wildcard::Patch::Hide - Hide some modules from
    Module::List::Wildcard

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Module::List::Wildcard::Patch::Hide (from Perl distribution
    Module-List-Wildcard-Patch-Hide), released on 2020-09-21.

SYNOPSIS
     % PERL5OPT=-MModule::List::Wildcard::Patch::Hide=-module,'Foo::Bar;Baz' app.pl

    In the above example "app.pl" will think that "Foo::Bar" and "Baz" are
    not installed even though they might actually be installed.

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to simulate the absence of certain modules. This
    only works if the application uses Module::List::Wildcard's
    "list_modules()" to check the availability of modules.

    This module works by patching "list_modules()" and strip the target
    modules from the result.

PATCH CONTENTS
    *   wrap "list_modules"

PATCH CONFIGURATION
    *   -module => str

        A string containing semicolon-separated list of module names to
        hide.
