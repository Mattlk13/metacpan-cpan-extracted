MooX::TaggedAttributes

This module attaches a tag-value pair to an attribute in a Moo class or
role, and provides a interface to query which attributes have which
tags, and what the values are.

  Tagging Attributes

To define a set of tags, create a special *tag role*:

    package T1;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => [ 't1' ];

    has a1 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

If there's only one tag, it can be passed directly without being wrapped
in an array:

    package T2;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => 't2';

    has a2 => ( is => 'ro', t2 => 'bar' );

A tag role is a standard Moo::Role with added machinery to track
attribute tags. As shown, attributes may be tagged in the tag role as
well as in modules which consume it.

Tag roles may be consumed just as ordinary roles, but in order for role
consumers to have the ability to assign tags to attributes, they need to
be consumed with the Perl use statement, not with the with statement.

Consuming with the with statement *will* propagate attributes with
existing tags, but won't provide the ability to tag new attributes.

This is correct:

    package R2;
    use Moo::Role;
    use T1;

    has r2 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

    package R3;
    use Moo::Role;
    use R3;

    has r3 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

The same goes for classes:

    package C2;
    use Moo;
    use T1;

    has c2 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

Combining tag roles is as simple as use'ing them in the new role:

    package T12;
    use T1;
    use T2;

    package C2;
    use Moo;
    use T12;

    has c2 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo', t2 => 'bar' );

  Accessing tags

Classes and objects are provided a _tags method which returns a hash of
hashes keyed off of the tags and attribute names. For example, for the
following code:

    package T;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => [ qw( t1 t2 ) ];

    package C;
    use Moo;
    use T;

    has a => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 2 );
    has b => ( is => 'ro', t2 => 'foo' );

The tag structure returned by either of the following

    C->_tags
    C->new->_tags

looks like

    { t1 => { a => 2 },
      t2 => { b => 'foo' },
    }
