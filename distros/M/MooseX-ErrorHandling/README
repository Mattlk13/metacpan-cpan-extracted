NAME

    MooseX::ErrorHandling - Monkey Patch Moose's Errors

VERSION

    version 0.2

SYNOPSIS

        whenMooseThrows CanOnlyConsumeRole => insteadDo {
            My::Exception->new(
                error => $_->message
            );
        };

DESCRIPTION

    This module is an attempt to monkey patch the way Moose handles errors.
    Currently Moose throws a number of different exception objects for
    different errors. If you're trying to replace an existing object system
    with Moose, suddenly your errors could be very different.

An Important Disclamer

    This module is almost certainly a bad idea, and I'm fairly sure I'm
    going to regret putting it on cpan.

TODO

      * Figure out a sane way to do this.
