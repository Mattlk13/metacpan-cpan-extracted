NAME

    Metrics::Any::Adapter::Statsd - a metrics reporting adapter for statsd

SYNOPSIS

       use Metrics::Any::Adapter 'Statsd';

DESCRIPTION

    This Metrics::Any adapter type reports metrics to statsd via the local
    UDP socket. Each metric value reported will result in a new UDP packet
    being sent.

    The location of the statsd server is set by two package variables,
    defaulting to

       $Net::Statsd::HOST = "127.0.0.1";
       $Net::Statsd::PORT = 8125

    The configuration can be changed by setting new values.

METRIC HANDLING

    Unlabelled counter, gauge and timing metrics are handled natively as
    you would expect for statsd; with multipart names being joined by
    periods (.).

    Distribution metrics are emitted as two sub-named metrics by appending
    count and sum. The count metric in incremented by one for each
    observation and the sum by the observed amount.

    Labels are not handled by this adapter and are thrown away. This will
    result in a single value being reported that accumulates the sum total
    across all of the label values. In the case of labelled gauges using
    the set_gauge_to method this will not be a useful value.

    For better handling of labelled metrics for certain services which have
    extended the basic statsd format to handle them, see:

      * Metrics::Any::Adapter::DogStatsd - a metrics reporting adapter for
      DogStatsd

      * Metrics::Any::Adapter::SignalFx - a metrics reporting adapter for
      SignalFx

TODO

      * Support non-one samplerates; emit only one-in-N packets with the
      @rate notation in the packet.

      * Optionally support one dimension of labelling by appending the
      conventional some.metric.by_$label.$value notation to it.
