NAME

    Metrics::Any::Adapter::Prometheus - a metrics reporting adapter for
    Prometheus

SYNOPSIS

       use Metrics::Any::Adapter 'Prometheus';

DESCRIPTION

    This Metrics::Any adapter type reports metrics to Prometheus by using
    Net::Prometheus. Each metric added to the adapter will be registered
    with the global Net::Prometheus::Registry instance.

    It becomes the calling program's responsibility to arrange for these to
    be HTTP accessible by using the Net::Prometheus API.

    Distribution metrics are exported as Histograms by default. They may
    alternatively be exported as Summaries in order to generate smaller
    amounts of export data, by setting the use_histograms import argument
    to false:

       use Metrics::Any::Adapter 'Prometheus', use_histograms => 0;

    Timer metrics are implemented as distribution metrics with the units
    set to seconds.

METHODS

 make_distribution

       $adapter->make_distribution( $name, %args )

    In addition to the standard arguments, the following are recognised:

    buckets => ARRAY[ NUM ]

      If present, overrides the default Histogram bucket sizes.

    bucket_min => NUM

    bucket_max => NUM

    buckets_per_decade => ARRAY[ NUM ]

      Since version 0.04.

      A more flexible alternative to specifying literal bucket sizes. The
      values given in buckets_per_decade are repeated, multiplied by
      various powers of 10 to generate values between bucket_min (or a
      default of 0.001 if not supplied) and bucket_max (or a default of
      1000 if not supplied).
