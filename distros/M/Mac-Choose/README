DESCRIPTION
    "choose" is a commercial commandline utility for OS X from Tiny Robot
    Software that shows a simple fuzzy-matching GUI for selecting from one
    of several options.

       http://tinyrobotsoftware.com/choose/

    This module is a really really thin wrapper around it that handles
    installing the command line utility and provides a function to do the
    shelling out to "choose" via IPC::Open2.

    While installing this module installs a copy of choose, if you continue
    to use this code beyond the time unlimited trial you should purchase a
    license from Tiny Robot Software

  Function
    This module exports one function on request, or you can call it fully
    qualified.

    choose @possibilities
        Shows the GUI allowing the user to pick from the possibilities.
        Returns the selected option, or undef if the user canceled the
        selection (by hitting ESC / clicking outside the dialog.)

  Configuring
    This module uses the copy of "choose" distributed with the module
    distribution by default. If you've installed "choose" somewhere else and
    you want to use that, you can use the $Mac::Choose: :executable_path to
    override the path to the executable.

       local $Mac::Choose::executable_path = "/stuff/bin/choose";
       my $char = choose "Buffy","Willow","Xander","Tara","Oz";
