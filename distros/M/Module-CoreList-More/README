SYNOPSIS

     use Module::CoreList::More;
    
     # true, this module has always been in core since specified perl release
     Module::CoreList::More->is_still_core("Benchmark", 5.010001);
    
     # false, since CGI is removed in perl 5.021000
     Module::CoreList::More->is_still_core("CGI");
    
     # false, never been in core
     Module::CoreList::More->is_still_core("Foo");
    
     my %modules = list_still_core_modules(5.010001);

DESCRIPTION

    This module is my experiment for providing more functionality to (or
    related to) Module::CoreList. Some ideas include: faster functions,
    more querying functions, more convenience functions. When I've got
    something stable and useful to show for, I'll most probably suggest the
    appropriate additions to Module::CoreList.

    Below are random notes:

FUNCTIONS

    These functions are not exported. They can be called as function (e.g.
    Module::CoreList::More::is_still_core($name) or as class method (e.g.
    Module::CoreList::More->is_still_core($name).

 first_release( MODULE )

    Like Module::CoreList's version, but faster (see "BENCHMARK").

 first_release_by_date( MODULE )

    Like Module::CoreList's version, but faster (see "BENCHMARK").

 removed_from( MODULE )

    Like Module::CoreList's version, but faster (see "BENCHMARK").

 removed_from_by_date( MODULE )

    Like Module::CoreList's version, but faster (see "BENCHMARK").

 is_core( MODULE, [ MODULE_VERSION, [ PERL_VERSION ] ] )

    Like Module::CoreList's version, but faster (see "BENCHMARK").

 is_still_core( MODULE, [ MODULE_VERSION, [ PERL_VERSION ] ] )

    Like is_core, but will also check that from PERL_VERSION up to the
    latest known version, MODULE has never been removed from core.

    Note/idea: could also be implemented by adding a fourth argument
    MAX_PERL_VERSION to is_core, defaulting to the latest known version.

 list_core_modules([ PERL_VERSION ]) => %modules

    List modules that are in core at specified perl release.

 list_still_core_modules([ PERL_VERSION ]) => %modules

    List modules that are (still) in core from specified perl release to
    the latest. Keys are module names, while values are versions of said
    modules in specified perl release.
