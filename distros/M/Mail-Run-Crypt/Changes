Revision history for Perl module Mail::Run::Crypt

This project began life as a monolithic Perl script. It does much the
same thing now but it's refactored out into an application and a module.

0.10 2017-12-04

 - Switch to translatable shebang for binscript

0.09 2017-10-27

 - Use warn/die as appropriate, rather than carp/croak.

0.08 2017-10-23

 - Some more tests, but still no proper mockup behaviour.

0.07 2017-10-18

 - Expand test suite a little more to test that encrypt-and-sign mode
   objects are created correctly, and that both key ID and passphrase
   have to be provided for the object to build.

0.06 2017-10-18

 - Expand test suite's test of constructed object's state. Much more
   work is still needed as I figure out how to mock up the object
   interfaces required without spraying email everywhere or requiring
   system commands to be run.

0.05 2017-10-15

 - Backport to Perl v5.8.1

0.04 2017-10-14

 - Another documentation fix

0.03 2017-10-14

 - Several more documentation fixes

0.02 2017-10-14

 - Lots of documentation fixes and reformatting

0.01 2017-10-05

 - First perlmodded release, refactoring and rewriting much older code.
