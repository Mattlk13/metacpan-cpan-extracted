History of user-visible changes for Math::MatrixDecomposition.  -*- text -*-


Version 1.06

* This is a maintenance release without user-visible changes.


Version 1.05

* Fixed a bug in the eigenvectors calculation procedure for
  non-symmetric matrices.  Results are different.  Also use the

  more accurate eigenvectors for ill-conditioned matrices.
