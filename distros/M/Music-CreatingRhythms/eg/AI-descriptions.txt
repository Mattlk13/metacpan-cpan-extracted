### Response:
The Perl script provided uses the Moo object-oriented module and a number of other modules to implement various rhythmic algorithms. Here is an explanation of each function in the script:

1. `b2int` - This method converts binary sequences into intervals by counting zeros between ones in the sequence. It takes one argument, an array reference containing binary sequences, and returns a new array reference with converted intervals.

2. `cfcv` - The function calculates a continued fraction convergent given certain terms. It uses the terms as input and outputs an array reference that contains the numerator and denominator of the convergent.

3. `cfsqrt` - This method generates the continued fraction representation for the square root of a number up to a specified precision. The function takes two arguments, the number whose square root is being calculated and the desired precision (number of terms), and returns an array reference with these terms.

4. `chsequl` - Generates a Christoffel word given certain parameters such as type ('u' for upper or 'l' for lower), numerator and denominator, and number of terms to generate. If the number of terms is not specified, it defaults to the sum of the numerator and denominator.

5. `comp` - This function generates all possible compositions of a given integer n. A composition is an arrangement of elements into non-empty parts where order matters but repetition within each part does not matter. It returns an array reference containing these compositions.

6. `compa`, `compam`, and `compm` - These functions generate all possible compositions with a certain number of allowed intervals or a specific number of parts respectively. They return an array reference containing the generated compositions.

7. `comprnd` and `compmrnd` - Both these methods generate random compositions for a given integer n. The first one does so randomly, while the second generates compositions with a certain number of elements in each part (m). They return an array reference containing the generated composition(s).

8. `count_digits` and `count_ones/zeros` - These methods count the occurrences of a specific digit or '1' or '0', respectively, in a given number or string. It returns the count as an integer.

9. `de_bruijn` - This method generates the largest de Bruijn sequence for a given order n. A de Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence containing every possible subsequence of length n exactly once. The function takes one argument, the order n, and returns an array reference with this sequence.

10. `euclid` - This method generates a Euclidean rhythm where certain number of onsets are distributed over a given number of beats. It returns an array reference representing this rhythm.

11. `int2b` - Converts intervals into binary sequences. The function takes one argument, an array reference containing the intervals, and returns a new array reference with converted binary sequences.

12. `invert_at` and `reverse_at` - These methods invert or reverse a section of a given sequence at a certain index n respectively. They take two arguments, the index n and the sequence as an array reference, and return a new array reference with modified sequence.

13. `neck`, `necka`, `neckam`, and `neckm` - These methods generate binary necklaces of length n or with certain number of ones respectively. They take one or more arguments depending on the function being called, and return an array reference containing generated necklaces.

14. `part`, `parta`, `partam`, and `partm` - These methods generate all possible partitions of a given integer n with certain intervals or a specific number of parts respectively. They take one or more arguments depending on the function being called, and return an array reference containing generated partitions.

15. `permi` - This method generates all permutations of a given list of elements using Algorithm::Combinatorics' permutations method. It takes an array reference as argument and returns another array reference with the generated permutations.

16. `pfold` - Generates "paper folding" sequences where certain parameters define the number of terms, size of binary representation of the folding function, and the folding function itself respectively. The function returns an array reference containing these sequences.

17. `rotate_n` - Rotates a given sequence (necklace) n times using Music::AtonalUtil's rotate method. It takes two arguments, the number of rotations n and the sequence as an array reference, and returns a new array reference with the rotated sequence.

The script also defines a `_allowed` subroutine that checks if a given partition is allowed or not according to certain intervals. The `_oddeven` method is used by pfold for calculating x and y such that n = (2^x) * (2y+1).

~

1. `b2int`: This function takes a set of binary sequences and converts them into intervals. For example, if you pass it `[[1,0],[1,0,0]]`, it will return `[[1,2,3]]`.

2. `cfcv`: This function calculates the continued fraction convergent given a set of terms. It is used to find the best rational approximations to real numbers by using their continued fraction expansions.

3. `comp`, `compa`, `compam`, and `compm`: These functions are used to generate compositions of numbers, which are ways to partition an integer into smaller parts. The arguments passed to these functions determine the specific composition that is generated.

4. `count_digits`, `count_ones`, and `count_zeros`: These functions count the number of a given digit in a string or vector. For example, if you pass it `100110100`, it will return 5 for both `count_digits(0)` and `count_digits(1)`.

5. `de_bruijn`: This function generates the largest de Bruijn sequence of order n, which is a cyclic sequence containing all possible combinations of length n with no repeating subsequences.

6. `invert_at`, `reverse_at`, and `rotate_n`: These functions perform operations on binary sequences at specific positions. For example, if you pass it `100110100` and ask to invert the sequence at position 2, it will return `10110100`.

7. `neck`, `necka`, `neckam`, and `neckm`: These functions generate binary necklaces of a certain length with or without specific constraints on their intervals.

8. `part`, `parta`, `partam`, and `partm`: These functions are used to generate all possible partitions of an integer into smaller parts, either with or without specific constraints on the lengths of those parts.

9. `permi`: This function takes a list of integers and returns all possible permutations of that list as an array-reference of array-references.

10. `pfold`: This function generates "paper folding" sequences, which are binary sequences that represent the creases on a piece of paper after it has been folded multiple times in different directions. The arguments passed to this function determine the specific sequence that is generated.

The code also includes some utility functions and other functions not mentioned here.
