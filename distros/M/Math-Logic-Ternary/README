Math-Logic-Ternary version 0.004
================================

Ternary or three-valued logic is a logic in which there are three
truth values indicating true, false and some third value, often
used to denote uncertainty or indefiniteness.

Ternary logic could be (and has been) implemented in electronic
hardware.  Some nice mathematical properties make it an interesting
alternative to binary logic for the design of digital systems.

This library aims to serve as an experimental kit to explore the
behaviour of basic operations of a ternary computer without having
to build specialized hardware first.  It also tries to shed light
on some design considerations related to ternary computing, such
as word sizes, number systems, or just names.  While it does not
claim to be authoritative in any of these matters, at least some
effort has been made to be practicable and consistent.

The interface is mostly object-oriented with a couple of importable
plain functions provided for convenience.

As of version 0.004, the library is still in beta state.  Feel free to
send comments, observations and suggestions to the author.  He would
especially like to hear about features actually implemented in ternary
digital hardware, whether addressed in this library or not.

This version is the first official beta release of the library.
Earlier versions should no longer be used.  Upcoming development
will aim to extend the API without radically changing existent
functionality, unless of course there is a compelling reason to do
so.  At the present stage, nothing should be considered final.
