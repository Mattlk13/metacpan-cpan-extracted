NAME
    Module::Abstract::Cwalitee - Calculate the cwalitee of your module
    Abstract

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Module::Abstract::Cwalitee
    (from Perl distribution Module-Abstract-Cwalitee), released on
    2019-07-08.

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::Abstract::Cwalitee qw(
         calc_module_abstract_cwalitee
         list_module_abstract_cwalitee_indicators
     );

     my $res = calc_module_abstract_cwalitee(
         abstract => 'Calculate the cwalitee of your module Abstract',
     );

DESCRIPTION
    What is module abstract cwalitee? A metric to attempt to gauge the
    quality of your module's Abstract. Since actual quality is hard to
    measure, this metric is called a "cwalitee" instead. The cwalitee
    concept follows "kwalitee" [1] which is specifically to measure the
    quality of CPAN distribution. I pick a different spelling to avoid
    confusion with kwalitee. And unlike kwalitee, the unqualified term
    "cwalitee" does not refer to a specific, particular subject. There can
    be "module abstract cwalitee" (which is handled by this module), "CPAN
    Changes cwalitee", and so on.

FUNCTIONS
  calc_module_abstract_cwalitee
    Usage:

     calc_module_abstract_cwalitee(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   abstract* => *str*

    *   exclude_indicator => *array[str]*

        Do not use these indicators.

    *   exclude_indicator_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Do not use indicators from these modules.

    *   exclude_indicator_status => *array[str]*

        Do not use indicators having these statuses.

    *   include_indicator => *array[str]*

        Only use these indicators.

    *   include_indicator_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Only use indicators from these modules.

    *   include_indicator_status => *array[str]* (default: ["stable"])

        Only use indicators having these statuses.

    *   min_indicator_severity => *uint* (default: 1)

        Minimum indicator severity.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   exclude => *array[str]*

        Exclude by name.

    *   exclude_module => *array[perl::modname]*

    *   max_severity => *int* (default: 5)

        Maximum severity.

    *   min_severity => *int* (default: 1)

        Minimum severity.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
