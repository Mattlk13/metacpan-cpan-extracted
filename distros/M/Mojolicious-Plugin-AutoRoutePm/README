NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AutoRoutePm - Mojolicious plugin to create routes
    by *.pm modules which are a controller

VERSION
    version 0.17

SYNOPSIS
        use Mojolicious::Lite;
        plugin 'AutoRoutePm', {
            route   => [ app->routes ],
            top_dir => 'site',
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This module recursive passes through template_base_dir to find perl
    modules (*.pm) that are a subclass of Mojolicious::Controller and adds
    routes for them.

USAGE
    For module X::Y::Z it adds the decamelize version

      x/y/z
      x/y/z/index
      x/y/z/index/*query

    all redirect to action route inside module.

    If Z is default_index it adds also

      x/y
      x/y/*query

    The last structure is useful for routing seach. But be careful to
    correct relative urls of other items in html page.

    This can be done in many ways. One is, as an example, to add to the
    layout a base_url like this

      % my $base_url = url_for(undef, {query => undef}); $base_url =~ s|/$||;
      <base href="<%= $base_url %>" />

  register
      plugin->register($app);

    Register plugin in Mojolicious application.
