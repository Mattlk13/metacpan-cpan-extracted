Revision history for Perl module Mac::iTerm::LaunchPad

1.08 - 2008-01-18
	* Exit gracefully in Makefile.PL is someone tries to run it
	on a non-Mac (yeah, that's you CPAN Testers!)
	* Requires at least Perl 5.006 now
	* No need to upgrade if you already have this

1.07 - 2007-03-16
	* Upgraded Mac::Glue prereq to 1.28 (after the Intel fixes)

1.06 - 2007-01-25
	* turn on strictures to make CPANTS happy

1.05 - 2007-01-20
	* Added some bits to the Makefile.PL to create the iTerm glue if
	it isn't already there. If it cannot finally load the iTerm glue,
	it dies, although it did create the Makefile. The tests will
	fail in that case (at least until you manually install the iTerm
	glue). See Mac::Glue for details about using gluemac.
	* This resolves RT # 24473 from stennie. Thanks :)

1.04 - 2007-01-20
	* Added more to the docs to explain the new-iterm program
	* Fixed up some things that made it into the pre-CVS-imported dir
	I was accidently working in (two demerits for that!).

1.02 - 2007-01-20
	* Doc patch to fill in the DESCRIPTION portion

1.01 - 2007-01-20
	* First release of script to create new iTerm sessions in specified
	directories, but without a lot of typing
