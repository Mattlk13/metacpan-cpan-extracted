Hey List,
    This has me stumped! Maybe I am just missing something really obvious. 
I am using ImageMagick 5.2.2 and for testing puposes I am using the little 
test program on the website under the API section. No matter what I do, the 
program cores on ReadImage().

This is the program I am using to test:
http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/www/api.html

I have pointed the MagickIncarnate() function to the appropriate directory 
on my box.

Does anybody have any ideas?? What could I be doing wrong.

Here is my ouput from DBX
(dbx) step
stopped in main at line 29 in file "test.c"
    29     GetExceptionInfo(&exception);
(dbx) where
=>[1] main(argc = 1, argv = 0xeffff3c4 "\xef\xff\xf5^H"), line 29 in "test.c"
(dbx) step
stopped in main at line 30 in file "test.c"
    30     image_info=CloneImageInfo((ImageInfo *) NULL);
(dbx) step
stopped in main at line 31 in file "test.c"
    31     (void) strcpy(image_info->filename,"test.jpg");
(dbx) step
stopped in main at line 32 in file "test.c"
    32     printf("iamge_info->filename is %s\n",image_info->filename);
(dbx) step
iamge_info->filename is test.jpg
stopped in main at line 33 in file "test.c"
    33     image=ReadImage(image_info,&exception);
(dbx) step
signal SEGV (no mapping at the fault address) in getc at 0xef267b24
0xef267b24: getc+0x0024:        ld      [%i0], %o0
Current function is main
    33     image=ReadImage(image_info,&exception);
