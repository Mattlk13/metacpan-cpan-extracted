The problem with general font metrics in ImageMagick is that there are
four schemes for obtaining fonts FreeType 1, FreeType 2,
Postscript/Ghostscript fonts, and X11 fonts.  Freetype returns plenty
of information associated with font metrics.  I know of no way to get
the font metrics from Ghostscript and X11 fonts returns metrics but
they do not exactly match the information returned by Freetype.
Layered on top of that is the fonts can be manipulated with an affine
matrix with varying results for the different font schemes.  Currently
I write fonts to an image that bounds the font and turn all pixels not
covered by the font lettering to transparent then composite this on top
of the image being annotated.

The only metrics available now are the maximum font height and string
width.  In Perl, for example, use

  $font->Read('label:This is a test');
  ($width,$height)=$font->Get('width','height');

I can certainly include other metric information as well but how to do
this consistently for all font schemes?  Perhaps I could retain the
font metrics for Freetype fonts only?  Or can you think of a few
specific font metrics that would be useful to you that we can get for
FreeType, X11, and Postscript fonts?  What is a minimal set of font
metrics you need to make annotating more useable?
