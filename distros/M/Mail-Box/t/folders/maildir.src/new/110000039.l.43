I wasn't passing all the required compiler flags when building
my program. I had looked at the output of Magick-config, and
simply copied the library dependencies into a Makefile. To
successfully build, ImageMagick clients also need the correct
CFLAGS arguments, etc.

This solved my problem with a C based ImageMagick client, but
I don't know whether it is relevant for PerlMagick programs.
