Welcome to the magick-developer mailing list!

Please save this message for future reference.  Thank you.

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
you can send mail to <Majordomo@imagemagick.org> with the following
command in the body of your email message:

    unsubscribe magick-developer

or from another account, besides markov@ATComputing.nl:

    unsubscribe magick-developer markov@ATComputing.nl

If you ever need to get in contact with the owner of the list,
(if you have trouble unsubscribing, or have questions about the
list itself) send email to <owner-magick-developer@imagemagick.org> .
This is the general rule for most mailing lists when you need
to contact a human.

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

The ImageMagick mailing list (magick@wizards.dupont.com) is a low noise
and subject oriented mailing list.  The subject is the discussion of
ImageMagick software and its use.  Although the list is unmoderated, do
not post off-topic messages to the list.  Off-topic messages will
result in the offender being silently removed from the list and
prevented from rejoining.

Please follow these guidelines when posting or responding to posted
messages:

  1. postings must be related to ImageMagick, PerlMagick, CineMagick,
     or WebMagick.  Here is an example of what not to post:

       Does anyone know of a program that converts WWF to JPG on the
       Mac?

     Post these to comp.graphics instead.

  2. postings should be concise but provide enough detail for readers to
     discern what the problem is and respond with a solution.  Here is
     an example of what not to post:

       I downloaded ImageMagick and it doesn't work.  What's up?

     Yes, I have seen these messages.  More detail is needed for a
     proper response.

  3. responses should be sent to the author, and not the list, if the
     response is not of general interest.  For example,

       I'm converting libMagick to a C++ class library.  Anyone want to
       help?

     Discuss this privately with the author and make a general
     announcement when you complete your work.

  4. Only relevant portions of a message should be quoted.  Do not
     quote the entire message, for example, and give a one line
     response.

  5. Do not post administriva messages such as "How do I unsubscribe
     from the list?"  Instead, see

	 http://www.imagemagick.org/www/magick-list.html

     for help.

  6. Do not post test messages to the list.

An archive of all messages posted to the mailing list is available to peruse.
See

    ftp://ftp.wizards.dupont.com/pub/ImageMagick/mailing-list

You can also browse or search the archive.  See

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 68 major
formats) including popular formats like TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, Photo CD,
and GIF. With ImageMagick you can create images dynamically, making it
suitable for Web applications. You can also resize, rotate, sharpen,
color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your completed
work in the same or differing image format. Image processing operations
are available from the command line, as well as through C, C++, and
PERL-based programming interfaces.

Here is just a few examples of what ImageMagick can do:

    Convert an image from one format to another (e.g. TIFF to GIF) 
    Resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image 
    Create a montage of image tumbnails 
    Create a transparent image suitable for use on the Web 
    Turn a group of images into a GIF animation sequence 
    Create a composite image by combining several separate images 
    Draw shapes or text on an image 
    Decorate an image with a border or frame 
    Describe the format and characteristics of an image 

You can access ImageMagick functions directly from the command line
using the ImageMagick tools convert, mogrify, montage, combine, or
identify. Use the display program to interactively manipulate your
images or animate an image sequence from a graphical panel. Finally
you have access to the various image manipulation methods directly
from your favorite application development environment: Perl, C++, C,
or Java. These programs and much more are explained by following the
links from this page or read the ImageMagick Users Guide.

ImageMagick is known to compile and run on virtually any Unix. system and
Linux. It also runs under Windows 2000, Windows 95/98, Macintosh, VMS,
and OS2. See the install guide for compiling instructions. Pre-compiled
binaries are available for some of the more popular operating systems.

ImageMagick Tools

  display
     Display is a machine architecture independent image and display
     program.  It can display an image on any workstation display
     running an X server.  Display can read and write many of the more
     popular image formats (e.g.  JPEG, TIFF, PNM, Photo CD, etc.).
     You can perform these functions on the image:

         o load an image from a file
         o display the next image
         o display the former image
         o display a sequence of images as a slide show
         o write the image to a file
         o print the image to a Postscript printer
         o delete the image file
         o create a Visual Image Directory
         o select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
         o undo last image transformation
         o copy a region of the image
         o paste a region to the image
         o restore the image to its original size
         o refresh the image
         o half the image size
         o double the image size
         o resize the image
         o crop the image
         o cut the image
         o flop image in the horizontal direction
         o flip image in the vertical direction
         o rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
         o rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
         o rotate the image
         o shear the image
         o trim the image edges
         o invert the colors of the image
         o vary the color brightness
         o vary the color saturation
         o vary the image hue
         o gamma correct the image
         o sharpen the image contrast
         o dull the image contrast
         o perform histogram equalization on the image
         o perform histogram normalization on the image
         o negate the image colors
         o convert the image to grayscale
         o set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
         o reduce the speckles within an image
         o eliminate peak noise from an image
         o detect edges within the image
         o emboss an image
         o oil paint an image
         o segment the image by color
         o annotate the image with text
         o draw on the image
         o edit an image pixel color
         o edit the image matte information
         o composite an image with another
         o add a border to the image
         o add an image comment
         o apply image processing techniques to a region of interest
         o display information about the image
         o display information about this program
         o display image to background of a window
         o set user preferences
         o discard all images and exit program
         o change the level of magnification
         o display images specified by a World Wide Web (WWW)
           uniform resource locator (URL)

  import
     Import reads an image from any visible window on an X server and
     outputs it as an image file.  You can capture a single window, the
     entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.  You can
     use display (see display(1)) utility for redisplay, printing,
     editing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc.  of the
     captured image.

     The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be selected
     by clicking the mouse in the desired window.  If you press a
     button and then drag, a rectangle will form which expands and
     contracts as the mouse moves.  To save the portion of the screen
     defined by the rectangle, just release the button.  The keyboard
     bell is rung once at the beginning of the screen capture and twice
     when it completes.

  animate
     Animate displays a sequence of images on any workstation display
     running an X server.  Animate first determines the hardware
     capabilities of the workstation.  If the number of unique colors
     in an image is less than or equal to the number the workstation
     can support, the image is displayed in an X window.  Otherwise the
     number of colors in the image is first reduced to match the color
     resolution of the workstation before it is displayed.

     This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits/pixel image can display
     on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device.  In most
     instances the reduced color image closely resembles the original.
     Alternatively, a monochrome or pseudo-color image sequence can
     display on a continuous-tone 24 bits/pixels device.

  montage
     Montage creates a composite image by combining several separate
     images.  The images are tiled on the composite image with the name
     of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

  convert
     Convert converts an input file using one image format to an output
     file with a differing image format. By default, the image format
     is determined by it's magic number. To specify a particular image
     format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon
     (i.e.  ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix
     (i.e. image.ps).  Specify file as - for standard input or output.
     If file has the extension .Z, the file is decoded with
     uncompress.

  mogrify
     Mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of images.  These
     transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color reduction,
     and others.  The transmogrified image overwrites the original
     image.

  identify
     describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
     files.  It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.
     The information displayed includes the scene number, the file
     name, the width and height of the image, whether the image is
     colormapped or not, the number of colors in the image, the number
     of bytes in the image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.),
     and finally the number of seconds it took to read and process the
     image.

  combine
     Combine combines images to create new images.
