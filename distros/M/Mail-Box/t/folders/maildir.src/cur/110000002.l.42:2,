Someone on this list and my image folks here seem to confirm that the
problem
here is with 'fringe' pixels that were not trimmed back as neatly as
possible.  Any
suggestions for automating this?  This whole thing needs to be batched.  I
played
with the transparency and fuzz options with no real difference noted.
Trying 
crop 0x0 makes some of the fringe whitespace areas neater, but it doesn't
get rid
of them.

Any suggestions?
