I worked on the definition of the JP2 file format.  The situation with
JPEG2000 is not at all like JPEG.

You should know is that JP2 is a very simple wrapper around the formal
JPEG2000 "codestream". It was based on the Quicktime idea of "atoms". This
simple idea is that you have a tag and a length followed by the "stuff". You
know what the "stuff" is based on the tag type. You can also nest these
atoms to build more complex structures.

JP2 is a very simple set of these atoms, most of which are optional. You
could write a program to implement this in about 15 minutes.  The "hard"
part of JP2 is the "codestream". This is the encoded JPEG2000 data. Good
luck on that. We don't have a freely available reference implementation at
this point because nobody has signed up to do it. There was an effort
underway by the same group that did the JPEG-LS implementation. This was
given to the public domain..

http://spmg.ece.ubc.ca/research/jpeg/jpeg_ls/jpegls.html

They actually had an implementation of JPEG2000 on their website but pulled
it off:

http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~mdadams/jasper/

Apparently, they decided to sell out and try to charge for it instead of
providing it to the public domain. We all know how well that is going to
work. When are people going to learn that you can't make money selling
compression software? It's not a business - its just an enabler.

My opinion is that without a "Tom Lane" type signing up to make a free
implementation available, JPEG2000 is doomed. You just don't get real
interoperability from a paper spec. We know this.

The good news is that the Digital Imaging Group (DIG) has a project underway
to do this. The bad news is that it has not yet started. And so we wait :-)
