The factors are no longer really factors, but orders for a convolution
kernel, if I've understood it all correctly. Since convolution has
become available in ImageMagick, many of the old filters have been
rewritten to use a kernel (blur, sharpen, charcoal, emboss, edge).

The convert manual page mentions that good values are odd numbers
between 3 and 31.

Martien

PS. If you don't know what convolution is: apply a matrix to each pixel,
and it's surrounding neighbors covered by the matrix. The values of each
covered pixel get multiplied by the matrix cell's value, and all added
together. The new value for the target pixel is this sum. The 'order'
that I talked about above is the height and width of the matrix involved
(in ImageMagick they're always square).
