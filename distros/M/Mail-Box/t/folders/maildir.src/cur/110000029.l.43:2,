Under unixware to print from displayt to an HP laserjet (usual command
to print postscript being
lp -dhpraw -Tpostscript),  I changed the delegates.mgk file (which I
found in /usr/local/share/Magick as installed from the SCO skunkware CD)
from

ps<=print
       /usr/bin/lp -c -s %i

to

ps<=print
        /usr/bin/lp -dhpraw -c -s -Tpostscript %i

and  it appears everything is working.  The -c make an immediate copy
and feeds it to the spooler and without it you get an error message
(below) which my guess is is a bit misleading in that I have to assume
that what is really happening is that without the -c IM is not passing
anything to the spooler........

Subject: Status of lp request hpraw-347

        Your request hpraw-347 destined for hpraw
        encountered an error during filtering.

        Reason for failure:

        UX:lp:   ERROR: Cannot read the file "/tmp/hacienda.jpg".
        TO FIX: See if it still exists and is readable, or
                consult your system administrator.


I have tried this with jpegs, gifs etc and in quite a number of
locations
Placed the -c -s back in
