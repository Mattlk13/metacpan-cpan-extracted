I'm trying to do the following:

1)  Take a JPEG image and size it down to a particular size.
2)  Overlay that JPEG on top of an GIF image to form a combined result.

This works fine for the most part:  I use mogrify to resize, followed by 
combine to overlay.

Now I'm presented with GIF images (the ones the JPEG is put on top of)
that have colors or other background attributes we want to 'show through'
the overlay where there is no image.

Even without any transparency options this seems to ALMOST work.  The
problem is that there's a small area around each image of 'white' that
always
shows up.  Trying transparency or the 'matte' option of '-draw' seems to
have
no effect.

Any ideas?  I'm an engineer -- not an image expert.  The images in question
are handed to me.  I can change them if necessary and if it can be done via
the ImageMagick tool.  The volume we generate makes manual changes to 
each image out of the question.
