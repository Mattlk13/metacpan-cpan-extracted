Hi,

Maybe someone knows a solution, maybe for enhancement:

  I have an image (say black on white), where white is set
  to be transparent.  I can display the image on any background,
  without seeing white.
    Now I resize the image with anti-aliasing.  For that, we have
  to intermediate pixels, which also requires interpolating
  the black pixels and background pixels.
    But: I my case, the background has a different (but known) color
  every time i.e. need to anti-alias the same image to different
  backgrounds.  I would like to write:

     my $image->Read('original.gif');
     $image->Set(background => 'blue');
     $image->Scale('50%x50%');
     $image->Write('small.gif');

However, ImageMagick (ImageMagick 4.2.7, PerlMagick 4.27 on Linux)
takes as value for a transparent pixel not the value of `background',
but the color used to define a transparent color: in this case
`white'.  My image reduced as above shows white pixels on my blue
background.

  Is my expectation wrong?

  Does anyone know a work-around?
