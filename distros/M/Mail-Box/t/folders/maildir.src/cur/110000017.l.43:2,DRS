So: gravity work differently from my well known "anchor", where
x,y defines a point and anchor the location of the point wrt the
item to be put on the background.  It was not clear from the docs.

It what you propose a feature or a designed thing?  You specify the
coordinate of the right-top (NorthEast) wrt to the right-bottom
(SouthEast).  I expect that x=0,y=0,SouthWest will work wrt to
NorthWest.  It is not logical for me to treat North/South differently
from East/West (designed before the fall of the Iron curtain?)

And also: the text still appears in black.
