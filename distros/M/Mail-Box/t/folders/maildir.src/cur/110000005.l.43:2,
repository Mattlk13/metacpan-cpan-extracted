OK - here is a "possible" solution. This sequence relies on the fact that
the input image was originally composited on a white background. It takes
the image and generates a "fake" alpha channel (mask) and uses this during
the compositing operation. It looks pretty good, but has the disadvantage
that the background will tend to influence the colors in the final image
more then you would want.

: first convert to an RGB format with no more transparency or mask channel
convert -compression none MCS_C_11452.gif MCS_C_11452_rgb.bmp
: now make a fake alpha channel using a grayscale version of the image
(inverted) 
convert -compression none -colorspace gray -negate MCS_C_11452.gif
MCS_C_11452_a.bmp
: combine the original image along with the fake alpha channel onto the
background
combine -gravity south -compose over MCS_C_120x150.gif MCS_C_11452.gif
MCS_C_11452_a.bmp result.gif
