NAME
    Module::HideRename - Hide modules by renaming them

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Module::HideRename (from Perl
    distribution Module-HideRename), released on 2020-02-13.

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::HideRename qw(
         hiderename_modules
         unhiderename_modules
     );

     hiderename_modules(modules => ['Foo', 'Foo::Bar']);
     # this will rename Foo.pm to Foo_hidden.pm and Foo/Bar.pm to Foo/Bar_hidden.pm

     unhiderename_modules(modules => ['Foo', 'Foo::Bar']);
     # this will rename back Foo_hidden.pm to Foo.pm and Foo/Bar_hidden.pm to Foo/Bar.pm

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes all you need to do to hide a module from a Perl code is
    install an @INC hook (e.g. like what Devel::Hide or
    Test::Without::Module does). But sometimes you actually need to hide
    (rename) the module files.

FUNCTIONS
  hiderename_modules
    Usage:

     hiderename_modules(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   modules* => *array[perl::modname]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
