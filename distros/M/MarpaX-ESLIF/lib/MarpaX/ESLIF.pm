=head1 NAME

MarpaX::ESLIF - ESLIF is Extended ScanLess InterFace

=head1 VERSION

version 2.0.14

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MarpaX::ESLIF;

  my $eslif = MarpaX::ESLIF->new();
  printf "ESLIF library version: %s\n", $eslif->version;

With a logger, using Log::Any::Adapter::Stderr as an example:

  use MarpaX::ESLIF;
  use Log::Any qw/$log/;
  use Log::Any::Adapter ('Stderr', log_level => 'trace' );

  my $eslif = MarpaX::ESLIF->new($log);
  printf "ESLIF library version: %s\n", $eslif->version;

This class and its derivatives are thread-safe. Although there can be many ESLIF instance, in practice a single instance is enough, unless you want different logging interfaces. Once a MarpaX::ESLIF instance is created, the user should create a L<MarpaX::ESLIF::Grammar> instance to have a working grammar.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ESLIF is derived from perl's L<Marpa::R2>, and has its own BNF, documented in L<MarpaX::ESLIF::BNF>.

The main features of this BNF are:

=over

=item Sub-grammars

The number of sub grammars is unlimited.

=item Regular expressions

Native support of regular expression using the L<PCRE2|http://www.pcre.org/> library (i.e. this is <not> exactly perl regexps, although very closed).

=item Streaming

Native support of streaming input.

=back

Beginners might want to look at L<MarpaX::ESLIF::Introduction>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 MarpaX::ESLIF->new($loggerInterface)

  my $loggerInterface = My::Logger::Interface->new();
  my $eslif = MarpaX::ESLIF->new();

Returns an instance of MarpaX::ESLIF, noted C<$eslif> below.

C<$loggerInterface> is an optional parameter that, when its exists, must be an object instance that can do the methods documented in L<MarpaX::ESLIF::Logger::Interface>, or C<undef>.

An example of logging implementation can be a L<Log::Any> adapter.

=head2 $eslif->version()

  printf "ESLIF library version: %s\n", $eslif->version;

Returns a string containing the current underlying ESLIF library version.

=head1 NOTES

The perl interface is an I<all-in-one> version of L<marpaESLIF|https://github.com/jddurand/c-marpaESLIF> library, which means that character conversion is using C<iconv> (or C<iconv>-like on Windows) instead of ICU, even if the later is available on your system.
