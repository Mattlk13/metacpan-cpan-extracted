Memoize::Saves

Memoize::Saves is a plug-in module for Memoize. It allows the user to
specify which values should be cached or which should be dumped. Please
read the manual for Memoize for background information.

Use the CACHE option to specify a list of return values which should be
memoized. All other values will need to be recomputed each time.

Use the DUMP option to specify a list of return values which should not
be memoized. Only these values will need to be recomputed each time.

Use the REGEX option to specify a Regular Expression which must match for
the return value to be saved. You can supply either a plain text string
or a compiled regular expression using qr//. Obviously the second method
is prefered.

Specifying multiple options will result in the least common denominator
being saved.

You can use the HASH option to string multiple Memoize Plug-ins together:

   tie my %disk_hash => 'GDBM_File', $filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0666;
   tie my %expiring_cache => 'Memoize::Expire',
              LIFETIME => 5, HASH => \%disk_cache;
   tie my %cache => 'Memoize::Saves',
              REGEX => qr/my/, HASH => \%expiring_cache;

   memoize ('printme', SCALAR_CACHE => [HASH => \%cache]);
