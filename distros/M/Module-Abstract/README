NAME
    Module::Abstract - Extract the abstract of a locally installed Perl
    module

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Module::Abstract (from Perl
    distribution Module-Abstract), released on 2021-08-27.

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::Abstract qw(module_abstract);

     say module_abstract("strict"); # => prints something like: Perl pragma to restrict unsafe constructs

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  module_abstract
    Usage:

     my $abstract = module_abstract($mod_name);

    Extract abstract from module source. Will first load module source using
    Module::Installed::Tiny's "module_source()" function (which dies on
    failure e.g. when it can't find the module). Then will search using
    simple regex this pattern:

     =head1 NAME

     Some::Module::Name - some abstract

    or (usually present in Dist::Zilla-managed distribution):

     #ABSTRACT: some abstract

    Will return undef if abstract cannot be found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
