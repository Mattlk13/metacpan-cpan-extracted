SYNOPSIS

     use Media::Info qw(get_media_info);
     my $res = get_media_info(media => '/path/to/celine.mp4');

    Sample result:

     [
       200,
       "OK",
       {
         audio_bitrate => 128000,
         audio_format  => 85,
         audio_rate    => 44100,
         duration      => 2081.25,
         num_channels  => 2,
         num_chapters  => 0,

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a common interface for Media::Info::* modules,
    which you can use to get information about a media file (like video,
    music, etc) using specific backends. Currently the available backends
    include Media::Info::Mplayer, Media::Info::Ffmpeg,
    Media::Info::Mediainfo.

SEE ALSO

    Video::Info - This module is first written because I couldn't install
    Video::Info. That module doesn't seem maintained (last release is in
    2003 at the time of this writing), plus I want a per-backend namespace
    organization instead of per-format one, and a simple functional
    interface instead of OO interface.
