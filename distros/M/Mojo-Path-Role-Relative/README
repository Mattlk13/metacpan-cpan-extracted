NAME
    Mojo::Path::Role::Relative - Relative operations on a Mojo::Path

SYNOPSIS
      $path = Mojo::Path->with_roles('+Relative')->new('/foo/bar/baz/data.json');
      $base = Mojo::Path->new('/foo/bar');
      # 1
      $path->is_subpath_of($base);
      # "baz/data.json"
      $path->to_subpath_of($base);
      # "baz/data.json"
      $path->to_rel($base);

DESCRIPTION
    "to_rel" in Mojo::URL was deprecated sometime ago. A suggestion was made
    to move the functionality to Mojo::Path. This is an implementation of
    that suggestion as a role <Role:Riny>.

METHODS
    This role adds the following methods to Mojo::Path when composed.

  is_subpath_of
  to_rel
  to_subpath_of
