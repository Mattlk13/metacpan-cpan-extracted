Mojolicious::Plugin::AutoReload

This plugin automatically reloades the page when the Mojolicious webapp
restarts. This is especially useful when using the Morbo development
server
<http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Tutorial#Reloading>,
which automatically restarts the webapp when it detects changes.
Combined, "morbo" and "Mojolicious::Plugin::AutoReload" will
automatically display your new content whenever you change your webapp
in your editor!

This works by opening a WebSocket connection to a specific Mojolicious
route. When the server restarts, the WebSocket is disconnected, which
triggers a reload of the page.

The AutoReload plugin will automatically add a "<script>" tag to your
HTML pages while running in "development" mode. If you need to control
where this script tag is written, use the "auto_reload" helper.

To disable the plugin for a single page, set the
"plugin.auto_reload.disable" stash value to a true value:

    get '/' => sub {
        my ( $c ) = @_;
        # Don't auto-reload the home page
        $c->stash( 'plugin.auto_reload.disable' => 1 );
        ...
    };
