=head1 NAME

Module::Generic::Array - An Array Manipulation Object Class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ar = Module::Generic::Array->new( [qw( Joe John Mary )] );
    printf( "There are %d people\n", $ar->length );
    # Adding one more
    $ar->push( "Jack" );

=head1 VERSION

    v0.1.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this class/package is to provide an object-oriented approach at array manipulation

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Provided with an optional array reference or an array object such as L<Module::Generic::Array>, this will create a new object and return it.

=head2 as_hash

Returns an hash reference with the keys being the array elements and the hash values their offset value.

=head2 clone

Creates a clone of the current array object and returns it.

=head2 delete

Provided with an offset value and an optional length, and this will remove data from the array at the given offset and for the given length.

If no given length is provided, it removes all entries from the offset until the end.

It returns a list of elements removed in list context or an array reference of it in scalar context.

=head2 each

Provided with a code reference such as a reference to a subroutine, and this will execute the code passing it the array offset and the current value as the 2 arguements. The current value is also accessible with C<$_>

    $a->each(sub
    {
        print( "I got $_\n" );
        # could also write:
        # print( "I got $_[1] at offset $_[0]\n" );
    });

To exit the loop, return C<undef()>, for example:

    $a->each(sub
    {
        return if( $_ eq $not_this_one );
        print( "ok, this one\n" );
    });

=head2 exists

Provided with a value and this returns the number of match, as an L<Module::Generic::Number> object, if it is found in the array, or false otherwise.

=head2 first

Returns the first element of the array, if any. If there are none, to ensure chaining will work, it will return a L<Module::Generic::Null> object.

=head2 for

Provided with a subroutine reference and this will call the subroutine reference, passing it the offset number and the corresponding array value.

    $ar->for(sub
    {
        my( $i, $val ) = @_;
        # do something
    })

C<$_> is made available and contains the value of C<$val>

It returns the object itself so this can be chained.

To exit the loop, return C<undef()>, for example:

    $a->for(sub
    {
        return if( $_ eq $not_this_one );
        print( "ok, this one\n" );
    });

=head2 foreach

Provided with a subroutine reference and this will call the subroutine reference, passing it the value for each entry in the array.

    $ar->foreach(sub
    {
        my $val = shift( @_ );
        # do something
    })

It returns the object itself so this can be chained.

C<$_> is made available and contains the value of C<$val>

To exit the loop, return C<undef()>, for example:

    $a->foreach(sub
    {
        return if( $_ eq $not_this_one );
        print( "ok, this one\n" );
    });

=head2 get

Provided an integer representing an offset and this returns the corresponding value in the array. Offsets start from 0. A blank value will be treated as 0.

    my $a = Module::Generic::Array->new( [qw( abc def ghi )] );
    $a->get( 1 ); # def
    $a->get( '' ); # abc
    $a->get( undef() ); # abc
    $a->get( -1 ); # ghi

=head2 grep

Provided with some data, and this will do a grep on the array.

If the data provided is a code reference or a reference to a subroutine, the code reference will be called for each array entry, and C<$_> will also be available for each entry.

If the data is a regular expression, each array entry is tested against it.

It returns a list of matches found in ilst context and a new L<Module::Generic::Array> in scalar context.

=head2 join

Provided with a string, or expression just as documented in L<perlfunc/"join"> and this will return a string as an L<<Module::Generic::Scalar> object.

=head2 keys

This works as documented in L<perlfunc/"keys"> and returns a list of offset values for each entry in the array.

=head2 last

Returns the last element of the array. If there are none, instead it will return a L<Module::Generic::Null> to ensure chaining will still work.

=head2 length

Returns the size of the array, starting from 1, as a L<Module::Generic::Number> object.

=head2 list

Reeturns the array as a list

    my $a = Module::Generic::Array->new( [qw( Joe John Mary )] );
    print( "@$a" ); # Joe John Mary
    my @people = $a->list; # @people now is ( "Joe", "John", "Mary" )

=head2 map

Provided with a reference to a subroutine and this will call the subroutine for each element of the array and return a list in list context or a new L<Module::Generic::Array> otherwise.

For each iteration of the array, C<$_> is made available.

    print( $a->map(sub{ $_->value })->join( "\n" ), "\n" );

=head2 pop

Returns the last entry in the array.

=head2 push

Provided with some data and this adds it at the end of the array.

=head2 push_arrayref

Provided with an array reference, and this add all its entry at the end of the array.

    my $ar = Module::Generic::Array->new( [qw( John Joe Mary )]);
    $ar->push_arrayref( [qw( Jack Peter )] );
    print( $ar->join( "," ), "\n" );
    # Now prints: John, Joe, Mary, Jack, Peter

=head2 reset

This empty the array, just like L</"undef">

=head2 reverse

Returns a the array in reverse order in list context or a new L<Module::Generic::Array> object of it in scalar context.

=head2 scalar

Returns the size of the array. It basically calls L</length>

=head2 set

Provided with an array or an array-based object and this replace all the data in the current object by the ones provided.

=head2 shift

Remove the first entry and returns it.

=head2 size

Returns the size of the array starting from 1, and 0 if the array is empty, as a L<Module::Generic::Number> object.

=head2 sort

Sort the array and return the new array as a list in list context or a new L<Module::Generic::Array> object in scalar context.

=head2 splice

Takes the same arguments as the L<perlfunc/"splice"> function and returns the result.

=head2 split

Just like the normal L<perlfunct/"split"> function, it takes a string or expression and split the data provided into a list of elements.

It returns the list in list context, and returns a new L<Module::Generic::Array> object in scalar context.

=head2 undef

Just like L</"reset">, this empty the array.

=head2 unshift

This add the given values at the beginning of the array.

=head2 values

Get a list of all the array values and return a list in list context or a ne L<Module::Generic::Array> object in scalar context.
