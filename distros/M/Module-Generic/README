NAME
    Module::Generic - Generic Module to inherit from

SYNOPSIS
        package MyModule;
        BEGIN
        {
            use strict;
            use Module::Generic;
            our( @ISA ) = qw( Module::Generic );
        };

VERSION
        v0.12.13

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Generic as its name says it all, is a generic module to inherit
    from. It is designed to provide a useful framework and speed up coding
    and debugging. It contains standard and support methods that may be
    superseded by your the module using Module::Generic.

    As an added benefit, it also contains a powerfull AUTOLOAD transforming
    any hash object key into dynamic methods and also recognize the dynamic
    routine a la AutoLoader from which I have shamelessly copied in the
    AUTOLOAD code. The reason is that while "AutoLoader" provides the user
    with a convenient AUTOLOAD, I wanted a way to also keep the
    functionnality of Module::Generic AUTOLOAD that were not included in
    "AutoLoader". So the only solution was a merger.
