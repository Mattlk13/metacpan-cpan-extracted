Thanks to everyone that helped with talks, staffing, moving boxes, =
grabbing coffee, and everything else around the conference this year. =
This one was one for the record books, and we've been getting some =
really great feedback to build on for next year. It sounds like this was =
one of the best conferences ever for many of the attendees. Some quick =
bullet points for your consumption:

Speakers
A special thank you to the speakers this year! Thank you for all of the =
effort you put in to your talks. The content is what makes this =
conference, worthwhile for all of our attendees. Your effort is greatly =
appreciated.=20

Non-panelists: please send us your presentations, so we can get then up =
on the site.

The speaker polls are open until the 10th, and we=E2=80=99ll be pushing =
attendees to submit ratings for a bit yet. Once they=E2=80=99ve closed =
I=E2=80=99ll get it all aggregated and sent out to you.=20

Retro
We will be having a conference retro on October 16th in the DGLR (10am =
on not streamed or recorded, sorry remotes!) for anyone that would like =
to attend. If you have feedback you=E2=80=99d like to provide but =
won=E2=80=99t be able to attend, please send it to =
conference-leadership.

Signatures
Just a quick reminder: if you still have the cPanel conference in your =
email, helpdesk, or forums signature, it's time to remove it!

Time off
Also: The community team will be off most of today, and all of tomorrow, =
and I=E2=80=99ll be in Singapore next week. If you need me, hip chat or =
email will be best.

Thanks again!
