MooX::Cmd::ChainedOptions

For applications using MooX::Cmd and MooX::Options,
MooX::Cmd::ChainedOptions transparently provides access to command line
options from further up the command chain.

For example, if an application provides options at each level of the
command structure:

  app --app-opt cmd --cmd-opt subcmd --subcmd-opt

The subcmd object will have direct access to the "app_option" and
"cmd_option" options via object attributes:

  sub execute {
      print $self->app_opt, "\n";
      print $self->cmd_opt, "\n";
      print $self->subcmd_opt, "\n";
  }
