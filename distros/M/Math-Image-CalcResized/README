NAME
    Math::Image::CalcResized - Calculate dimensions of image/video resized
    by ImageMagick-like geometry specification

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Math::Image::CalcResized (from
    Perl distribution Math-Image-CalcResized), released on 2024-08-29.

FUNCTIONS
  calc_image_resized_size
    Usage:

     calc_image_resized_size(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Given size of an image (in WxH, e.g. "2592x1944") and ImageMagick-like
    resize instruction (e.g. "1024p>"), calculate new resized image.

    Examples:

    *   no resizing:

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => ""); # -> [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "2592x1944"]

    *   scale (down) to 20%:

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => "20%"); # -> [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "518x388"]

    *   scale (down) width to 20% but height to 40%:

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => "20%x40%");

        Result:

         [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "518x777"]

    *   scale (down) width to 20% but height to 40% (first percent sign is
        optional):

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => "20x40%");

        Result:

         [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "518x777"]

    *   set width to 1024px:

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => 1024); # -> [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "1024x768"]

    *   shrink width to 1024px:

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => "1024>");

        Result:

         [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "1024x768"]

    *   shrink width to 10240px (no effect since width is already less than
        10240px):

         calc_image_resized_size(size => "2592x1944", resize => "10240>");

        Result:

         [200, "OK (envelope generated)", "2592x1944"]

    *   enlarge width to 1024px (no effect since width is already greater
        than 1024px:

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   resize* => *str*

        Resize instruction, follows ImageMagick format.

        Resize instruction can be given in several formats:

         Syntax                     Meaning
         -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
         ""                         No resizing.
 
         SCALE"%"                   Height and width both scaled by specified percentage.
         SCALEX"%x"SCALEY"%"        Height and width individually scaled by specified percentages. (Only one % symbol needed.)
 
         WIDTH                      Width given, height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
         WIDTH">"                   Shrink width if larger, height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
         WIDTH"^"                   Enlarge width if smaller, height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 
         "x"HEIGHT                  Height given, width automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
         "x"HEIGHT">"               Shrink height if larger, width automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
         "x"HEIGHT"^"               Enlarge height if smaller, width automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio.
 
         WIDTH"x"HEIGHT             Maximum values of height and width given, aspect ratio preserved.
         WIDTH"x"HEIGHT"^"          Minimum values of height and width given, aspect ratio preserved.
         WIDTH"x"HEIGHT"!"          Width and height emphatically given, original aspect ratio ignored.
         WIDTH"x"HEIGHT">"          Shrinks an image with dimension(s) larger than the corresponding width and/or height argument(s).
         WIDTH"x"HEIGHT"<"          Shrinks an image with dimension(s) larger than the corresponding width and/or height argument(s).
 
         NUMBER"^>"                 Shrink shortest side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.
         NUMBER"^<"                 Enlarge shortest side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.
         "^"NUMBER">"               Shrink longer side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.
         "^"NUMBER"<"               Enlarge longer side if larger than number, aspect ratio preserved.

        Currently unsupported:

         AREA"@"                    Resize image to have specified area in pixels. Aspect ratio is preserved.
         X":"Y                      Here x and y denotes an aspect ratio (e.g. 3:2 = 1.5).

        try>

    *   size* => *str*

        Image/video size, in <width>x<height> format, e.g. 2592x1944.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  image_resize_notation_to_human
    Usage:

     image_resize_notation_to_human(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Translate ImageMagick-like resize notation (e.g. "720^>") to
    human-friendly text (e.g. "shrink shortest side to 720px").

           "scale width to 50%, height to 50%",
         ]

    Resize notation supports most syntax from ImageMagick geometry. See
    Math::Image::CalcResized and ImageMagick documentation on geometry for
    more details.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
