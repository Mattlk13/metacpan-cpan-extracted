# NAME

Mojo::UserAgent::Role::Resume - Role for Mojo::UserAgent that provides resuming capability during downloads

# SYNOPSIS

    use Mojo::UserAgent;

    my $class = Mojo::UserAgent->with_roles('+Resume');

    my $ua = $class->new(max_attempts => 5);

    # works with blocking requests:
    my $tx = $ua->get('http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/100MB.zip');

    # ...as well as with non-blocking ones (including promises, etc):
    $ua->get('http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/100MB.zip', sub ($ua, $tx) {
        $tx->res->content->asset->move_to('downloaded_file.zip');
        print $tx->res->headers->to_string;
    });

    # The last snippet will save the entire file to downloaded_file.zip regardless of temporary disconnects, and
    # will print something like this:
    Connection: keep-alive
    Content-Length: 103124119

# DESCRIPTION

Mojo::UserAgent::Role::Resume is a role for Mojo::UserAgent that allows the user-agent to
retry a URL upon failure.

Retries are made after a connection error or after a server error (HTTP status 5xx) occurs.

It will intelligently determine whether the server it's downloading from properly supports ranged requests,
and if it doesn't, then upon failure it will stop asking for a resume and request the complete file again
from scratch.

It will request the original user-provided request in its next attempts, not the one that may have resulted from
redirections of the first attempt.

The `$tx` object returned is the last HTTP transaction that took place.

# ATTRIBUTES

[Mojo::UserAgent::Role::Resume](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo%3A%3AUserAgent%3A%3ARole%3A%3AResume) adds the following attribute to the [Mojo::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo%3A%3AUserAgent) object:

## max\_attempts

    my $ua = $class->new;
    $ua->max_attempts(5);

The number of attempts it will try (at most). Defaults to 1.

What matters for each download is the value this attribute held at the time the first attempt of that download was
started.

# TODO

- Write tests
- Check whether the module should also check whether "content received < total\_size\_based\_on\_headers" when
determining whether to retry
- Add events

Other than the above, this module works.
