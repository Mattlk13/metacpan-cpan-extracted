Revision history for Perl extension Math::Yapp.

1.01  Wed Apr 17 23:46:36 2013
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -XA -n Math::Yapp

    This is the first release.  No changes to report.

1.02  Sun Oct 06 23:33:28 2013 
      Successfully released to CPAN a couple of days ago and finally
      managed to see what the POD looks like.  YIKES!  This inspired
      two modifications:
      - Immediately set to correcting typos and unclear remarks in the POD.
        (I doubt it's perfect now.)
      - Added method Yapp_negate_roots(), which produces a polynomial whose
        roots are the negatives of the given polynomial.  (I hadn't realized
        that omission until I read the POD.)

1.03  Mon Oct 14 11:20:12 2013 
      - Commented out [use Math::BigFLoat;] and the call to
        Math::BigFLoat->accuracy() in the BEGIN block.  This because the
        BUGS section of Math::Complex warns me not attempt to use BigFloat.
        I left these stantements in there as comments as a reminder that I
        need to do something about the accuracy; 64 (or 80?)-bit floats
        don't quite cut it for polynomials above degree 8.

        Yes, this leaves a no-op BEGIN block.  But who knows what I'll come
        up with in a future release?

1.05  Fri Dec 26, 2014 10:59:50 AM
      - Fixed minor error in Interpolation testing module that raise
        compiler warnings.
      - Added code for Hermite interpolation test to use 6-points,
        instead of only 4 points, when running in a 64-bit environment.
        Note that at 7 points the rounding errors become too gross to
        pass muster.
      - Added method "YinnerProd", an innner product function,
        overloaded by the . operator.

1.06  Fri, May 15, 2015 11:36:55 AM
      - Completed more on innr-product space issues
      - Added complete documentation on inner-product space functionality,
        including a mea-culpa on what I have not yet done

1.08  Mon Jan 6 2025 14:00
      (I don't recall what I did for release 1.07 but I am adding info for
       1.08.)
      - Fixed some bugs in the constructor of a new polynomial.
      - In the first 2 tests, replaced some printf calls with diag and
        explain.  Later realized that "make test TEST_VERBOSE=1" displays
        the output of printf calls but it was awkward to remove te diag and
        explain commands.
      - Found & fixed more typos in the POD.
