NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify::OtherActions - Mojolicious plug-in which
    extends Restify with more actions

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        plugin 'Restify::OtherActions';

DESCRIPTION
    Extends Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify allowing to call other methods over
    REST collection

USAGE
    When you create your controller (see Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify
    documentation), you can use, as an example, this list method

      sub list {
        my $c               = shift;
        my $query =  $c->stash('query');
        return $c->$query if ($query);
        ...your original list code ...
      }

    to redirect your call to an alternative $query method.

    As an example, if your endpoint is "/accounts" then
    "/accounts/list/my_method/other/parameters" is redirect to
    "$c->my_method" and remaining url is available in "$c->stash->('opt')".

    In addition to standard routes added by Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify, a
    new route is added

        # Pattern             Methods   Name                        Class::Method Name
        # -------             -------   ----                        ------------------
        # ....
        # +/list/:query/*opt  GET       accounts_otheractions       Accounts::list

Notes about Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify
    This module extends Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify but solves also a
    little bug in route naming.

    In Mojolicious::Plugin::Restify /accounts and /accounts/:accounts_id
    have the same name (accounts).

    This module replace the second route appending "_id" so that in original
    module where there is

      # Pattern           Methods   Name                        Class::Method Name
      # -------           -------   ----                        ------------------
      # ...
      #   +/:accounts_id  *         "accounts"

    here there is

      #   +/:accounts_id  *         "accounts_id".
