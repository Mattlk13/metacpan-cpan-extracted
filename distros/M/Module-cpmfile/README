NAME

    Module::cpmfile - Parse cpmfile

SYNOPSIS

      use Module::cpmfile;
    
      my $cpmfile = Module::cpmfile->load("cpm.yml");
      my $reqs = $cpmfile->effective_requirements(undef, ["runtime"], ["requires"]);

DESCRIPTION

    THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL.

    cpmfile (usually saved as cpm.yml) is yet another file format for
    describing module dependencies, and Module::cpmfile helps you parse it.

    cpmfile will be used mainly by App::cpm.
