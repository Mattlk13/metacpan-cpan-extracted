0.1.9     2015-10-05 20:47:53+01:00 Europe/London
    - Some of the CPANTS test nodes running Windows Strawberry Perl are 
      reporting dubious test results due to broken TAP stream which results
      from errors emanating from Term::ReadKey on that platform only -
      
      GetConsoleMode failed, LastError=|6| at C:/Strawberry201/perl/site/lib/Term/ReadKey.pm line 334.
      
      Rather than dismiss it, I've switched from Term::ReadKey to IO::Stty
      in order to switch off echo for password entry. Hopefully it works.
      We'll see.
      
    - Minor comment changes
    
    - CI green lights Perl v5.8 thru v5.23 and coverage is at 100%;
      releasing to CPAN.

0.1.8     2015-10-05 00:17:54+01:00 Europe/London
    - Remove dependency on Syntax::Feature::Void as this was placing a 
      limit of 5.14 on the minimum supported Perl version, with CI tests
      only passing for 5.14 thru 5.20.
    
    - Remove seemingly benign duplicate use of "my" at line 1022 in a list
      declaration. Highlighted by CI tests for bleeding edge Perl 5.
      
    - CI passes for Perl 5.8 thru 5.22 and blead (5.23).
