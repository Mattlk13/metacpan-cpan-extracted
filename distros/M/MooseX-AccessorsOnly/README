A perl module to react in some fashion when users root around inside
your objects instead of using those beautiful accessor methods you
took all that effort to provide.

Installation proceeds in the usual fashion:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test # Except there are no tests :(
    make install

Or get it from the CPAN.

This module is licensed under the WTFPL version 2 because licenses are
for lawyers not engineers. Use this code or don't, it's all the same
to me.
