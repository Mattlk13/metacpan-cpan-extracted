NAME

    Mojo::SAML - A SAML2 toolkit using the Mojo toolkit

DESCRIPTION

    Mojo::SAML is a project to build a SAML toolkit using the Mojo stack.
    It is (for better or worse) completely reimplemented from the ground
    up. It is considered extremely experimental and unstable (see
    "CAVEATS").

    That said, it can do basic SAML interactions given the proper
    configuration. For more on SAML, you might want to consult
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0 or
    https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security.

CAVEATS

    It currently has plenty of limitations and should be considered
    extremely experimental. The API can and will change without warning
    until this warning is removed.

    It also relies heavily on using the simpler SAML bindings and is only
    really workable for RSA keys. Because of this, there are dependencies
    on Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA and Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 which really should be
    optional, though they are required until other signing mechanisms are
    included. Users are encouraged to add those modules to their own
    dependencies in case they become optional in the future.

    Currently data extraction and documentation are very much separate sets
    of code. It is not yet decided if this will continue or if some effort
    will be made to unify them. This is a large part of the concern for api
    stability.

    While most classes have API documentation, currently overall usage
    documentation is lacking. For the time being, examples can be seen in
    the ex/ directory within the source repository and/or distribution,
    especially ex/webapp.pl. These examples will be modified as the API
    changes and eventually usage documentation should be written.

    Mojo::XMLSig has some tests, the rest has precious few tests. There
    could always be more tests.

    All of this should be improvable. PRs and comments are most welcome.

EXPORTS

    Mojo::SAML exports nothing by default. On request it can export any of
    the following symbols or tags.

 XML Document Constructors

    The following symbols are constant functions which return the full name
    of Mojo::SAML::Document subclasses. Their name is both the name of the
    subclass and the tag that they create.

  AssertionConsumerService

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::AssertionConsumerService.

  AttributeConsumingService

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::AttributeConsumingService.

  AuthnRequest

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::AuthnRequest.

  ContactPerson

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::ContactPerson.

  EntityDescriptor

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::EntityDescriptor.

  KeyDescriptor

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::KeyDescriptor.

  KeyInfo

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::KeyInfo.

  NameIDPolicy

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::NameIDPolicy.

  Organization

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::Organization.

  RequestedAttribute

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::RequestedAttribute.

  Signature

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::Signature.

  SPSSODescriptor

    Constant shortcut to Mojo::SAML::Document::SPSSODescriptor.

 Tags

  :docs

    Exports all of the above document type constants.

OTHER MODULES

    While they aren't linked to from this module, some other modules that
    will likely be useful are:

 Mojo::SAML::Names

    Mojo::SAML::Names is a (fairly incomplete) list of naming conventions
    and standard used in SAML.

 Mojo::SAML::IdP

    Mojo::SAML::IdP is a tool for examining the entity metadata returned
    from an identity provider and extracting useful inforamation.

 Mojo::XMLSig

    Mojo::XMLSig is a tool for signing and verifying XML documents. Note
    that it is possible that this module could be spun out into its own
    distribution at some point. If it does, this module will depend on it.
