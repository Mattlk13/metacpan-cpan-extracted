NAME
    Mojo::Role - Tiny and simple role system for Mojo (DEPRECATED)

DESCRIPTION
    This module has been renamed to Mojo::RoleTiny and the namespace may be
    repurposed in the future. Instead of using it, you can now create roles
    using Mojo::Base directly.

      # For a role class
      use Mojo::Base -role;

      # To use/consume a role
      use Role::Tiny::With;
      with 'Role::SomeRoleClass';
