SYNOPSIS

        package Counter;
        use MouseX::POE;
    
        has count => (
            isa     => 'Int',
            is      => 'rw',
            lazy    => 1,
            default => sub { 0 },
        );
    
        sub START {
            my ($self) = @_;
            $self->yield('increment');
        }
    
        event increment => sub {
            my ($self) = @_;
            print "Count is now " . $self->count . "\n";
            $self->count( $self->count + 1 );
            $self->yield('increment') unless $self->count > 3;
        };
    
        no MouseX::POE;
    
        Counter->new();
        POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION

    MouseX::POE is a Mouse wrapper around a POE::Session.

KEYWORDS

    Create an event handler named $name.

METHODS

    Default POE-related methods are provided by
    MouseX::POE::Meta::Trait::Object which is applied to your base class
    (which is usually Mouse::Object) when you use this module. See that
    module for the documentation for it. Below is a list of methods on that
    class so you know what to look for:

    Get the internal POE Session ID, this is useful to hand to other POE
    aware functions.

    A cheap alias for the same POE::Kernel function which will gurantee
    posting to the object's session.
