custom::failures::x::alias

This package creates importable alias subroutines for failure classes
created by custom::failures.

Typically, you use custom::failures like this:

  package MyApp::failure;
  use custom::failures qw/io::flie io::network/;

and later

  package MyApp;
  use MyApp::failure;

  # somewhere deep in your code
  MyApp::failure::io::flie->throw();

"custom::failures::x::alias" creates shortened aliases so that you don't
have to type so much:

  package MyApp::failure;
  use custom::failures::x::alias qw/io::flie io::network/;

and later,

  package MyApp;
  use MyApp::failure ':all'

  # somewhere deep in your code
  io_flie->throw;
  io_network->throw;
