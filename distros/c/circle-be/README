QUESTIONS

 How do I connect to freenode.net #perl and identify with NickServ

       # in Global tab
       /networks add -type irc Freenode
    
       # in Freenode tab
       /set nick YourNickHere
       /servers add irc.freenode.net -ident yournamehere -pass secretpasswordhere
       /connect
    
       # Don't forget to
       /config save

 How do I get notifications whenever someone uses the word perl in a
 channel that isn't on magnet or freenode#perl

       /rules add input not(channel("#perl")) matches("perl"): highlight

    Rules are network-specific so just don't do that on Magnet.

 How do I set up a command to ban the hostmask for a given nick in the
 current channel for 24h

    You'll have to read the hostmask of the user specifically, but then

       /mode +b ident@host.name.here
       /delay 86400 mode -b ident@host.name.here

    Note the lack of / on the inner mode to delay
