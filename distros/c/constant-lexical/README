constant::lexical, version 2.0002

This module creates constants in the manner of constant.pm, but
limits their visibility to the enclosing lexical scope.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

This version reverts back to using  Lexical::Sub  for perls 5.18  and
5.20,  since the perl’s built-in lexical sub feature  is  not  stable
enough before  perl 5.22  (specifically before  v5.21.10-26-gd655d9a),
and caused WWW::Scripter::Plugin::Ajax to crash.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install constant::lexical"

    [sudo] cpan constant::lexical

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.8.0 or later, and depending on your version of
perl, it may require another module:

• For perl 5.8 to 5.10: Sub::Delete
• For perl 5.12 to 5.20: Lexical::Sub
• For perl 5.22 and higher: no other modules


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for these modules with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc constant::lexical

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man constant::lexical
