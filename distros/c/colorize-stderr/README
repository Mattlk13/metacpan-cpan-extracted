NAME
    colorize::stderr - Colorize STDERR

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of colorize::stderr (from Perl
    distribution colorize-stderr), released on 2020-03-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use colorize::stderr;
     warn "blah!"; # will be printed in yellow

    If you want to customize color:

     use colorize::stderr 'red on_white';
     warn "blah!";

    Use in command-line, nifty for debugging (making it easy to notice
    whether an output to terminal is to STDOUT or STDERR):

     % perl -Mcolorize::stderr ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a convenience wrapper over colorize::handle for colorizing
    STDERR.

    Caveat: although this module provides "unimport()", this code does not
    do what you expect it to do:

     {
         use colorize::stderr;
         warn "colored warning!";
     }
     warn "back to uncolored";

    Because "no colorize::stderr" will be run at compile-time. You can do
    this though:

     use colorize::stderr ();

     {
         colorize::stderr->import;
         warn "colored warning!";
         colorize::stderr->unimport;
     }
     warn "back to uncolored";
