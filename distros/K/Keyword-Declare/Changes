0.001002  Thu Jun 22 21:07:23 2017

0.001003  Thu Jul  6 13:00:39 2017

    * Made module compatible back to Perl 5.12
      (which is when pluggable keywords were first introduced)


0.001004  Thu Jul  6 19:20:00 2017

    * Tweaked Makefile.PL and docs to reflect 5.12 as minimal Perl version


0.001005  Sun Jul  9 08:15:17 2017

    * Tweaked docs to remove POD errors
      (Thanks, Mohammad)



0.001006  Thu Aug 17 23:06:46 2017

    * Extended keytypes defined using a regex or string to allow them to
      be declared with a $ sigil, in which case they create a
      compile-time variable containing that regex or string,
      as well as defining a (sigilless) keytype name as usual.
      (Thanks Sebastian!)



0.001007  Sun Jun 10 15:18:37 2018

    * Removed POD nits (Thanks, Hugo)

    * Added test for ->@*, etc.
      (Thanks, Curtis!)

    * Noted that module is incompatible with Keyword::Declare 0.04
      and updated Makefile.PL to reflect that
      (Thanks, Matt)


0.001008  Sun Jun 10 15:42:00 2018

    * Updated Makefile.PL to require ExtUtils::MakeMaker v7
      which supports more complex module version requirement specifications.


0.001009  Tue Jun 12 11:32:51 2018

    * Updated Makefile.PL to generate metadata that
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker v7 is required for configuration and build
      (Thanks, Slavin)

    * Updated Makefile.PL to new minimal PPR requirement
      (Thanks, Slavin)

    * Added 'unkeyword' anti-meta-keyword to remove keywords


0.001010  Fri Oct  5 07:09:40 2018

    * Minor doc tweaks


0.001011  Sun Mar 17 22:08:35 2019

    * Added a local replacement for Keyword::Simple::define()
      to support keywords that start with an underscore

    * Added auto-insertion of __DATA__ keyword as a workaround to support
      __DATA__ sections when Keyword::Declare is used
      (Thanks, Patrick!)


0.001012  Mon Mar 18 06:40:57 2019

    * Improved auto-insertion of __DATA__ keyword



0.001013  Wed Mar 20 21:42:21 2019

    * Improved compatibility with later versions of Keyword::Simple (>0.03)
      under earlier versions of Perl (<5.18). Module will now install
      under these combinations, but docs now warn that it the
      combination is not reliable.

    * Improved line number reporting for errors within keywords


0.001014  Fri Jul 12 07:57:14 2019

    * Further improved auto-insertion of __DATA__ keyword (thanks, Jeroen!)



0.001015  Mon Jan 20 05:07:54 2020

    * Added :sep attribute to allow repeated params to be separated
      by something other than whitespace
      (Thanks, Toby!)

    * Now supports named captures within a type-regex.
      If type-regex includes named captures, the corresponding
      arg will be an hash-based object of type Keyword::Declare::Arg,
      which stringifies to the match, but whose other keys are the
      named captures.
      (Thanks, Toby!)

    * Fixed bug that ignored postfix flags on keytype regexes

    * Fixed extraction of keyword array parameters whose type-regexes
      include sub-captures (no longer inserts extra sub-capture values
      into the array)



0.001016  Wed Feb  5 00:04:08 2020

    * Fixed doc example and added more explicit documentation showing
      how to detect missing optional parameters. The behaviour of 
      missing optional parameters changed in the previous release,
      but the suggested detection mechanism is backwards compatible.
      (Sorry, Christopher!)



0.001017  Sun Feb 16 23:57:31 2020

    * Fixed regression that introduced spurious empty matches
      in some repeated parameters.
      (Thanks, Slaven!)
