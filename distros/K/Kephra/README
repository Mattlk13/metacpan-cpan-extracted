NAME
    Kephra - compact, effective and beautiful coding editor

SYNOPSIS
        kephra [file_name]

    Small single file editor for perl with max editing comfort.

DESCRIPTION
    Kephra is an editor from and for programmers, currently at start of
    rewrite. This page gives you a summary how to use it.

  File IO
    Currently just the basics: ASCII and UTF-8 coding. Open, reload, save
    and saving under different file name. See the menu for key kombos.

  Editing
    Basic editing as expected: undo redo, cut copy paste delete. When
    nothing is selected Ctrl+C copies current line.

    Slightly more advanced is swapping selection and clipboard
    (Ctrl+Shift+V) and duplicate current line or selection with Ctrl+D.
    Ctrl+A grows selection from word to expression to line, block, sub until
    all is selected and shrink selection is just the opposite
    (Ctrl+Shift+A).

    Holding Ctrl allows you no navigate with left and right as expected word
    wise, up and down block wise and page up and page down subroutine wise.
    If the cursor is next to round a brace character you will navigate the
    its partner.

    Holding Alt moves the selected or current line up or down. Left and
    right indent and dedents char wise in this mode. Normal indent/dedent
    listens to Tab and Shift+Tab.

    Ctrl+K toggles comment status of current or selected lines (commented
    becomes uncommented and vice versa). Ctrl+Shift+K does the same, but
    with one difference. Ladder are the normal perl comments you might know
    (called line comments). The first option adds another letter after the
    pound symbol so that such (block) comments stay commented, even after
    come actions with Ctrl+Shift+K.

    Bracing characters (including '' and "") are always created in pairs and
    will embrace the selection.

  Search and Replace
    Kephra provides all the usual search and replace functions you expect.
    We made sure all is accessable via menu, searchbar and keyboard. The
    searchbar expands to replacebar via Strg+Shift+F or the *'='* button.
    There you can only search for the replace term and refert the current.
    Available options are: case sensitiv, words only, word starts, Regex,
    Wrap.

    F3 skips to next search term (selection by default) findings, F2 to next
    marker. Adding shift searhes in reverse order (to previous finding).
    Alt+F3 replaces selection with replace term and goes to next finding.
    Adding Shift again reverses order. Ctrl+F takes selection as search term
    and enters the search bar. Adding Shift takes the selection as replace
    term and enters the input field for the replace term where you can
    easily navigate the findings of search (up and down) and replace term
    (Alt+up/down) and change it in both directions with (Alt+)Enter.

    Ctrl+E jumps to position of last edit.

  View
    F11 toggles full screen mode.

PLAN
    Development is done is stages which are focused on different feature
    sets. Wer are in stage one called sed, where its all about basic editing
    with comfort and effectiveness Next stage will be called med and will be
    about having open several docs. Because *Kephra* is mainly released now
    on CPAN we will go on with versioning and choose 0.401 instead of 0.01.

    For more please check the TODO file.
