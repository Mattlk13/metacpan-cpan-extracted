NAME
    Kephra - compact, effective and inventive coding editor

SYNOPSIS
        kephra [file_name]

    Small single file editor for perl with max editing comfort.

DESCRIPTION
    Kephra is an editor from and for programmers, currently at start of
    rewrite. This page gives you a summary how to use it.

    The following is a rundown of the main functions sorted by main menu
    from left to right. Not mentioned there is:

    Holding Ctrl allows you no navigate with left and right as expected word
    wise, up and down block wise and page up and page down subroutine wise.
    If the cursor is next to round a brace character you will navigate the
    its partner.

    Bracing characters (including '' and "") are always created in pairs and
    will embrace the selection.

  File
    "New" (Ctrl+N), "Open" (Ctrl+O), "Reload" (Ctrl+Shift+O) (reopen same
    file), "Save" (Ctrl+S), "Save As .." (Ctrl+Shift+S) (save under
    different file name), "Save Under .." (Alt+Shift+S) (save current
    document state under (given in dialog) file name, but keep association
    with old file name), "Quit" (close Kephra) (Ctrl+Q), "No Ask Quit"
    (disregard unsaved files) (Ctrl+Shift+Q)

  Edit
    Basic editing as expected: "undo" (Ctrl+Z), redo (Ctrl+Y), if you add
    *Shift* here, you will go several undo steps at once. *Alt* instead of
    *Ctrl* moves you to start or end of the undo chain.

    Core functions: "cut" (Ctrl+X) removes the selected text or the current
    line (if nothing is selected) and copies it into the clipboard. Same is
    true for "copy" (Ctrl+C), which only copies without removing anything.
    "Paste" (Ctrl+V) inserts the copied text on the position of the caret
    (cursor). "Swap" (Ctrl+Shift+V) streamlines the copy and paste process a
    bit by replacing the selection with the old clipboard content, while
    copying the selection or current line. "Delete" (Del) only removes the
    selection or character on the caret position. "Duplicate" (Ctrl+D)
    copies and paste's the selected text or current line, without affecting
    the clipboard.

    More advanced is (Ctrl+A), which "grows selection" from word to
    expression to line, block, sub until all is selected and "shrink
    selection" is just the opposite (Ctrl+Shift+A).

  Format
    Holding Alt moves the selected or current line up or down. Left and
    right indent and dedents char wise in this mode. Normal indent/dedent
    listens to Tab and Shift+Tab.

    Ctrl+K toggles comment status of current or selected lines (commented
    becomes uncommented and vice versa). Ctrl+Shift+K does the same, but
    with one difference. Ladder are the normal perl comments you might know
    (called line comments). The first option adds another letter after the
    pound symbol so that such (block) comments stay commented, even after
    come actions with Ctrl+Shift+K.

  Search and Replace
    Kephra provides all the usual search and replace functions you expect.
    We made sure all is accessable via menu, searchbar and keyboard. The
    searchbar expands to replacebar via Strg+Shift+F or the *'='* button.
    There you can only search for the replace term and refert the current.
    Available options are: case sensitiv, words only, word starts, Regex,
    Wrap.

    F3 skips to next search term (selection by default) findings, F2 to next
    marker. Adding shift searhes in reverse order (to previous finding).
    Alt+F3 replaces selection with replace term and goes to next finding.
    Adding Shift again reverses order. Ctrl+F takes selection as search term
    and enters the search bar. Adding Shift takes the selection as replace
    term and enters the input field for the replace term where you can
    easily navigate the findings of search (up and down) and replace term
    (Alt+up/down) and change it in both directions with (Alt+)Enter.

    Ctrl+E jumps to position of last edit. If already there, the second last
    edit will be destination.

  Document
    If "Soft Tabs" is activated, the Tab key will insert a number of space
    cahracters. The "Indention Size" sets how many character this will be or
    how much visual space a tab character will take (also tab character will
    become visible when "whitespace" option in the *View* menu is set on).
    If "Line Ending" defines which character will be inserted by pressing
    (Enter). Next submenu helps you to set the encoding (currently only
    ASCII and UTF-8). At last position is the language of the syntax
    highlighter.

  View
    Here are items which can be turned on (visible) or off (invisible) lie
    white space character, end of line (EOL) marker, indent guides and the
    right margin, a vertical line marging the historical 80 character limit.
    Next are toggle options for the two types of margin on the left border
    of the editing widget: line number and margin for markers (special text
    position you can jump to). Further down are options to zoom text or
    break it on the right border of visibility. (F11) toggles full screen
    mode.

PLAN
    Development is done is stages which are focused on different feature
    sets. Wer are in stage one called sed, where its all about basic editing
    with comfort and effectiveness Next stage will be called med and will be
    about having open several docs. Because *Kephra* is mainly released now
    on CPAN we will go on with versioning and choose 0.401 instead of 0.01.

    For more please check the TODO file.
