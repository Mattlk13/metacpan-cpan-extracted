IO-ReadHandle-Chain

The current version is 1.1.0.

This module chains any number of data sources (scalar, file, IO
handle) together for reading through a single file read handle.

This is convenient if you have multiple data sources of which some are
very large and you need to pretend that they are all inside a single
data source.

Use the IO::ReadHandle::Chain object for reading as you would any
other file handle.

    use IO::ReadHandle::Chain;

    open $ifh, '<', 'somefile.txt';
    $text = 'This is some text.';
    $cfh = IO::ReadHandle::Chain->new('file.txt', \$text, $ifh);
    print while <$cfh>;
    # prints lines from file 'file.txt', then lines from scalar $text,
    # then lines from file handle $ifh

    @lines = <$cfh>;              # or get all lines at once

    # or read bytes instead
    $buffer = '';
    $bytecount = read($cfh, $buffer, 100);
    $bytecount = sysread($cfh, $buffer, 100);

    # or single characters
    $c = getc($cfh);

    close($cfh);

    # OO, too
    $line = $cfh->getline;
    @lines = $cfh->getlines;
    $bytecount = $cfh->read($buffer, $size, $offset);
    $bytecount = $cfh->sysread($buffer, $size, $offset);
    $c = $cfh->getc;
    $cfh->close;
    print "end!\n" if $cfh->eof;

You cannot write or seek through an IO::ReadHandle::Chain.

When reading by lines, then for each data source the associated input
record separator is used to separate the data into lines.

For any of the data sources that are file handles, when the end of the
associated data stream is reached, or if the chain filehandle object
is closed, then the object tries to reset the file handle's position
to what it was when the module started reading from the file handle.

The chain filehandle object does not close any of the file handles
that are passed to it as data sources.
