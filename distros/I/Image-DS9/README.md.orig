# NAME

Image::DS9 - interface to the DS9 image display and analysis program

# VERSION

version v1.0.0

# SYNOPSIS

    use Image::DS9;

    $dsp = new Image::DS9;
    $dsp = new Image::DS9( \%attrs );

# DESCRIPTION

This class provides access to the **DS9** image display and analysis
program through its **XPA** access points.

**DS9** is a rather flexible and feature-rich image display program.
Rather than extol its virtues, please consult the website in
["REQUIREMENTS"](#requirements).

While one could communicate with **DS9** solely via the [IPC::XPA](https://metacpan.org/pod/IPC%3A%3AXPA)
class, this class provides a cleaner, less error prone interface,
as it checks the passed commands and arguments for syntax and data
type.  It also cleans up returned data from **DS9**.

To use this class, first construct a **Image::DS9** object, and
then apply its methods.  It is possible to both address more
than one **DS9** with a single object, as well as having
multiple **Image::DS9** objects communicate with their own
**DS9** invocations.  Eventually there will be documentation
spelling out how to do this.
