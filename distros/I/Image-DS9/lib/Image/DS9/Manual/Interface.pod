=head1 NAME

Image::DS9::Manual::Interface - Image::DS9 Interface

=head1 VERSION

version v1.0.1

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

The document describes the general concepts of how the interface with
C<DS9> works.

=head2 Arguments

Commands sent to DS9 are sent as strings.  Many of the option strings
are available as Perl constants.  See L<Image::DS9::Constants> for
more details.

=head2 Boolean values

Some methods take boolean values; these may be the strings C<on>, C<off>,
C<yes>, C<no>, or the integers C<1> or C<0>.

=head2 Return Values

Because a single L<Image::DS9> object may communicate with multiple
instances of B<DS9>, queries may return more than one value.
Because one usually communicates with a single B<DS9> instance,
if a query is made in scalar mode, the result is returned as a scalar,
i.e.:

  $cmap = $dsp->cmap();

In this mode, if more than one server responds, you'll get the results
for a randomly chosen server.  Some methods, in particular C<fits>,
may return a scalar I<reference> when called in scalar mode, as the
returned data may be large, and it makes no sense to have multiple
copies of the data floating about.  See each method's documentation
(in L<Image::DS9::Manual::Connect>, and L<Image::DS9::Manual::API>) for details.

If a return value is multi-valued, a query in scalar context yields a
reference to an array.  For instance:

  ($x, $y) = $dsp->bin( 'about' )->@*;

returns a reference to an array, while

  $size = $dsp->bin( 'buffersize' );

returns a scalar.  Don't attempt to do

  ($x, $y ) = $dsp->bin( 'about' ); # ERROR DON"T DO THIS

as it will return a full blown hash as documented next.

When queries are made in list mode, the return values are hashes,
rather than scalars.  The hash keys are the names of the servers,
and the values are references to hashes with the keys C<name>,
C<buf> and C<message>.  The C<message> element is present if there was
an error. The C<buf> element contains the results of a query.

For example,

  use Data::Dump;

  dd scalar $dsp-cmap;

yields

  "grey"

while

  dd $dsp->cmap;

yields

  (
    "DS9:ds9 7f000001:43117",
    { buf => "grey", name => "DS9:ds9 7f000001:43117" },
  )

Ordinarily, the C<buf> element will be unaltered (except for the
removal of trailing newlines) from what B<DS9> outputs.  For
multi-valued return results, C<buf> is set to an array containing
the values:

  use Data::Dump;
  dd $dsp->bin( 'about' );

yields.

  (
    "DS9:ds9 7f000001:43117",
    { buf => [0, 0], name => "DS9:ds9 7f000001:43117" },
  )

Sending data doesn't result in a return value; if there's an error an
exception is thrown.

=head2 Error Returns

In case of error, an exception is thrown via B<croak()>.  The L<Image::DS9::Manual::Connect/res>
method will return a hash, keyed off of the servers' names.  For each
server which had an error, the hash value will be a reference to a
hash containing the keys C<name> and C<message>; the latter will
contain error information.  For those commands which return data, and
for those servers which did not have an error, the C<buf> key will be
available.
