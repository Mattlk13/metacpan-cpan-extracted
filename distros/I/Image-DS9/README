Image::DS9

This class provides access to the DS9 image display and analysis program
through its XPA access points.

DS9 is a rather flexible and feature-rich image display program. Rather
than extol its virtues, please consult the website in "REQUIREMENTS".

While one could communicate with DS9 solely via the IPC::XPA class, this
class provides a cleaner, less error prone interface, as it checks the
passed commands and arguments for syntax and data type. It also cleans
up returned data from DS9.

To use this class, first construct a Image::DS9 object, and then apply
its methods. It is possible to both address more than one DS9 with a
single object, as well as having multiple Image::DS9 objects communicate
with their own DS9 invocations. Eventually there will be documentation
spelling out how to do this.
