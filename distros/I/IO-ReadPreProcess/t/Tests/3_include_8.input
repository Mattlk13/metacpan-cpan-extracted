.# Title: Include using absolute path
.# This is about testing the different first character of an include path.
.#
.# This was originally part of 3_include_4.input but was removed because
.# it does not seem to work on MS Windows. Quite what Cwd() does on MS Windows
.# I don't know since I don't have such a machine; the documentation suggests
.# that it should work ... ho hum, I suspect that absolute paths will not be
.# wanted very often.

.# Absolute path.
.# PWD starts with a '/'
.# 2 ways of doing the same thing:
.eval .include \v{PWD}/t/Tests/3_include_4.inc
.include $PWD/t/Tests/3_include_4.inc
