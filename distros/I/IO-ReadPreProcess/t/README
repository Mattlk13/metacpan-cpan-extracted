You MUST not test .exit -- as that will kill the test script

Overview of testing:

Run the script test.t it looks in Tests/ and processes the *.input files,
output is sent to ../TestOut.
For each .input file there is a corresponding .want file that has the expected output.


Each .input file may start with some special comments. These comment lines
have the form (but without the leading spaces):

    .# Key: value

Eg:

    .# Title: Line Starting dot

The keys are:

    Title:	Some words
	A title that will be used for reporting
	.# Title: A simple test

    Preopen:	bool-value
	Use to test a preopened file, ie option Fd will be set.
	If bool-value is true (eg 1) pre-open the file

    Set:	expression
	An expression to run in the test environment before the test is run, eg:
	.# Set: a := 12 + 3

    NewOpt:	opt value
	An option to new() when creating Text::Expression. Eg:
	.# NewOpt: PipeOK 1

    UnixOnly:	bool-value
	If bool-value the test will only be run on a Unix machine.
	See 'man perlport' for values of $^O
	The ones currently understood as Unix are:
		aix bsdos darwin dgux dynixptx freebsd haiku linux hpux irix darwin
		machten next openbsd dec_osf svr4 unicos unicosmk sco_sv solaris sunos
	.# UnixOnly: 1

    Enable:	bool-value
	This may be used to cause a test to not be run. A test is not run if bool-value is false.
	Default is true, ie by default the test will be run
	.# Enable: 0

    OutOnError:	bool-value
	Show the output generated if it differs from the wanted output.
	.# OutOnError: 1

    Require:	module
	Modules to require before the test is done
	This is not fully implemented.
	Implies a fork.

    Fork:	bool-value
	To fork before doing the test
	This is not fully implemented.

    CheckFn:	string
	Check that the value sent to output stream 'fun' is the argument

    Out:	string
	Create an output stream name by this string.
	Where the output goes to will be testname.want.string, eg: 9_test_1.want.s1
	This will be checked.
	This may be given multiple times for multiple output streams.
