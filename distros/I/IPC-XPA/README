IPC::XPA

This class provides access to the XPA messaging system library, "xpa",
developed by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's High Energy
Astrophysics R&D Group. The library provides simple inter-process
communication via calls to the "xpa" library as well as via supplied
user land programs.

The method descriptions below do not duplicate the contents of the
documentation provided with the "xpa" library.

Only the client side routines are accessible.

  Methods

Unless otherwise specified, the class and instance methods are simple
wrappers around the similarly named XPA routines (just prefix the Perl
routines with "XPA").

  The XPA Library

The XPA library is available via the Alien::XPA Perl module on CPAN, as
well as at <https://github.com/ericmandel/xpa>.
