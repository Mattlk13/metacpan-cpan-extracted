IPC::XPA

This class provides access to the XPA messaging system library, "xpa",
developed by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's High Energy
Astrophysics R&D Group. The library provides simple inter-process
communication via calls to the "xpa" library as well as via supplied
user land programs.

The method descriptions below do not duplicate the contents of the
documentation provided with the "xpa" library.

Currently, only the client side routines are accessible.
