# NAME

Iterator::Flex::Map - Map Iterator Class

# VERSION

version 0.12

# METHODS

## new

    $iterator = Ierator::Flex::Map->new( $coderef, $iterable );

Returns an iterator equivalent to running [map](https://metacpan.org/pod/map) on `$iterable` with
the specified code.  `$iteratable` is converted into an iterator (if
it is not already one) via  ["to\_iterable" in Iterator::Flex::Factory](https://metacpan.org/pod/Iterator::Flex::Factory#to_iterable)).

`CODE` is _not_ run if `$iterable` returns _undef_ (that is, it is
exhausted).

The iterator supports the following methods:

- next
- reset
