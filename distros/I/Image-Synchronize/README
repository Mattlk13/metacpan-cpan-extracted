Image-Synchronize
=================

This package provides the imsync perl script and auxiliary perl
modules.  imsync can put image and associated non-image files on a
common timeline and can geotag images based on GPX files.

imsync is a console application.  You run it from a command shell and
configure it by specifying command options and arguments.

The default usage is to execute

  imsync

in the directory holding the files of interest.  This inspects the
files and reports proposed modifications but does not modify any files
(except for writing the progress log called imsync.log).  If you are
happy with the proposed modifications, then execute

  imsync --modify

to rerun and this time apply the proposed modifications.  If you are
not happy with the proposed modifications, then there are other
command line options for tweaking the operation.

Execute

  imsync --help

for basic help.  Execute

  imsync --man

for more detailed help.
