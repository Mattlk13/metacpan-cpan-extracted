NAME

    IO::Async::Loop::UV - use IO::Async with UV

SYNOPSIS

     use IO::Async::Loop::UV;
    
     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop::UV->new();
    
     $loop->add( ... );
    
     $loop->add( IO::Async::Signal->new(
           name => 'HUP',
           on_receipt => sub { ... },
     ) );
    
     $loop->loop_forever();

DESCRIPTION

    This subclass of IO::Async::Loop uses UV to perform its work.

    As both UV and the underlying libuv are quite new, this module
    currently has a few shortcomings and limitations. See the "BUGS"
    section.

BUGS

      * libuv does not provide a way to inspect the POLLHUP status bit, so
      some types of file descriptor cannot provide EOF condition. This
      causes a unit-test failure. (RT#113010)

      * libuv does not provide a way to be informed of any
      SIGCHLD/waitpid() status. Because of this there is no ability to
      watch for all processes by

         $loop->watch_process( 0 => sub { ... } );

      Attempts to do this will throw an exception.
