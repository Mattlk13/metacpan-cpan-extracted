Revision history for Image-DecodeQR-WeChat

0.01	2022-03-09/19:00
	First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
	Tests include checking for multiple QR codes in same image,
	and supports utf8 filenames and utf8 payloads.
	Note that for some images OpenCV's code crashes.
	Small QR codes or fuzzy ones. Avoid them.
	QR codes less than 55x55 px may have problems.
	Thank you OpenCV and WeChat.

0.2	2022-03-11/17:50
	Fixed pod in WeChat.pm

0.3	2022-03-11/18:30
	Added more tests for rotated QR codes.
	Fixes and additions to the documentation.

0.4	2022-03-14/19:02
	Made the OpenCV detection more robust to hopefully
	deal with systems without pkg-config.
	The added method is cmake-based which is OpenCV's
	preferred method of detecting compilation parameters.
	Hopefully OpenCV binaries installed on M$-windows
	will also include a cmake executable. If neither cmake
	nor pkg-config are present, then we fallback on ENV vars
	specified by user during 'perl Makefile.PL'.
	Added checks for whether OpenCV installation supports
	graphical output (highgui, imshow()) and supports showing
	the results in a window. This will hopefully
	avoid compilation errors because imshow() is undefined.
	Added checks for neutralising the 'graphicaldisplayresult'
	option if highgui is not supported. These are C functions.

0.5	2022-03-15/01:40
	Added some more module dependencies to Makefile.PL.
	Fixed some errors in script/image-decodeqr-wechat.pl.

0.6	2022-03-15/19:30
	Bummer! Sorry CPAN.

0.7	2022-03-15/19:31
	Fixed a problem with wechat_qr_decode_lib.cpp it should
	included the highgui.hpp only if HAS_HIGHGUI==1
