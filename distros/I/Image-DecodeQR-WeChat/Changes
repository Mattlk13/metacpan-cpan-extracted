Revision history for Image-DecodeQR-WeChat

0.01    2022-03-09/19:00
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        Tests include checking for multiple QR codes in same image,
        and supports utf8 filenames and utf8 payloads.
        Note that for some images OpenCV's code crashes.
        Small QR codes or fuzzy ones. Avoid them.
        QR codes less than 55x55 px may have problems.
        Thank you OpenCV and WeChat.
