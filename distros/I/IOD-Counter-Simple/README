NAME
    IOD::Counter::Simple - A simple counter using IOD/INI file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of IOD::Counter::Simple (from Perl
    distribution IOD-Counter-Simple), released on 2021-06-22.

SYNOPSIS
    From Perl:

     use IOD::Counter::Simple qw(increment_iod_counter get_iod_counter);

     # increment and get the dafault counter
     my $res;
     $res = increment_iod_counter(); # => [200, "OK", 1]
     $res = increment_iod_counter(); # => [200, "OK", 2]

     # the content of ~/counter.iod file after the above:
     [counter]
     default=2

     # dry-run mode
     $res = increment_iod_counter(-dry_run=>1); # => [200, "OK (dry-run)", 3]
     $res = increment_iod_counter(-dry_run=>1); # => [200, "OK (dry-run)", 3]

     # specify IOD file path and counter name, and also the increment
     $res = increment_iod_counter(path=>"/home/ujang/myapp.iod", counter=>"counter1"); # => [200, "OK", 1]
     $res = increment_iod_counter(path=>"/home/ujang/myapp.iod", counter=>"counter1", increment=>10); # => [200, "OK", 11]
     $res = increment_iod_counter(path=>"/home/ujang/myapp.iod", counter=>"counter2"); # => [200, "OK", 1]

     # the content of /home/ujang/myapp.iod file after the above:
     [counter]
     counter1=11
     counter2=1

     # get the current value of counter
     $res = get_iod_counter();               # => [200, "OK", 3, {'cmdline.exit_code'=>0}]
     $res = get_iod_counter(counter=>'foo'); # => [200, "OK", undef, {'cmdline.exit_code'=>1}]

    From command-line (install App::IODCounterSimpeUtils):

     # increment the dafault counter
     % increment-iod-counter
     1
     % increment-iod-counter
     2

     # dry-run mode
     % increment-iod-counter --dry-run
     3
     % increment-iod-counter --dry-run
     3

     # specify IOD file path and counter name, and also the increment
     % increment-iod-counter ~/myapp.iod counter1
     1
     % increment-iod-counter ~/myapp.iod counter1 -i 10
     11

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides simple counter using IOD/INI file as the storage.
    You can increment or get the value of a counter using a single function
    call or a single CLI script invocation.

FUNCTIONS
  dump_iod_counters
    Usage:

     dump_iod_counters(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Return all the counters in the IOD/INI file as a hash.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   path => *filename*

        IOD/INI file.

        If not specified, will default to $HOME/counter.iod. If file does
        not exist, will be created.

    *   section => *str* (default: "counter")

        INI section name where the counters are put.

        Counters are put as parameters in a specific section in the IOD/INI
        file, e.g.:

         [counter]
         counter1=1
         counter2=5

        This argument customizes the section name.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  get_iod_counter
    Usage:

     get_iod_counter(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Get the current value of a counter in an IOD/INI file.

    Undef (exit code 1 in CLI) can be returned if counter does not exist.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   counter => *str*

        Counter name, defaults to "default" if not specified.

        Note that counter name must be valid IOD/INI parameter name.

    *   path => *filename*

        IOD/INI file.

        If not specified, will default to $HOME/counter.iod. If file does
        not exist, will be created.

    *   section => *str* (default: "counter")

        INI section name where the counters are put.

        Counters are put as parameters in a specific section in the IOD/INI
        file, e.g.:

         [counter]
         counter1=1
         counter2=5

        This argument customizes the section name.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  increment_iod_counter
    Usage:

     increment_iod_counter(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Increment a counter in an IOD/INI file and return the new incremented
    value.

    The first time a counter is created, it will be set to 0 then
    incremented to 1, and 1 will be returned. The next increment will
    increment the counter to two and return it.

    If dry-run mode is chosen, the value that is returned is the value had
    the counter been incremented, but the counter will not be actually
    incremented.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   counter => *str*

        Counter name, defaults to "default" if not specified.

        Note that counter name must be valid IOD/INI parameter name.

    *   increment => *int* (default: 1)

        Specify by how many should the counter be incremented.

    *   path => *filename*

        IOD/INI file.

        If not specified, will default to $HOME/counter.iod. If file does
        not exist, will be created.

    *   section => *str* (default: "counter")

        INI section name where the counters are put.

        Counters are put as parameters in a specific section in the IOD/INI
        file, e.g.:

         [counter]
         counter1=1
         counter2=5

        This argument customizes the section name.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
