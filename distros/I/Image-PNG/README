This is the README for Image::PNG version 0.24.

Image::PNG is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains
four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Image::PNG - Read and write PNG files

This module is an attempt to make a simple interface for dealing with
images in the PNG format. See "About the PNG format" for details of
the format.

Image::PNG is a layer on top of "Image::PNG::Libpng". Whereas
"Image::PNG::Libpng" copies the interface of the C library "libpng",
Image::PNG is intended to be a more intuitive way to handle PNG
images. 

This module is not completed, so its interface is likely to
change. It's also open to suggestions for improvements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
website:

    * http://metacpan.org/release/Image-PNG

(This link goes to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Image::PNG

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.8.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Image::PNG

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Image::PNG

To install the module from the source file, Image-PNG-0.24.tar.gz, follow
this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Image-PNG-0.24.tar.gz
    cd Image-PNG-0.24
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
