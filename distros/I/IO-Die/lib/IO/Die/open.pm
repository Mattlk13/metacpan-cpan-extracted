#NOTE: This function does not attempt to support every possible way of calling
#Perlâ€™s open() built-in, but to support the minimal syntax required to do
#everything that is useful to do with open(), with preference given to those
#forms that may (somewhat arbitrarily) be considered "better".
#
#For example, this function does NOT allow one-arg or two-arg open() except for
#the more "useful" cases like when MODE is '-|' or '|-'.
#
#On the other hand, open($fh, '-') seems harder to understand than its 3-arg
#equivalent, open($fh, '<&=', STDIN), so that two-arg form is unsupported.
#
#Current forms of open() that this supports are:
#   - any form of 3 or more arguments
#   - 2-arg when the MODE is '-|' or '|-'
#
#NOTE: Bareword file handles DO NOT WORK. (Auto-vivification does, though.)
