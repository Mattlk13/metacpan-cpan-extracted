Revision history for Perl module IO::Framed

0.01 Fri Mar 31 2017
    - first release

0.011 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Compile/sanity fixes

0.012 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - instead of “input”/“output” in accessors,
      use “read”/“write” since those are the module and method names
      and should thus be easier to remember.

0.013 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Fix ReadWrite modules to actually work. :-/

0.014 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Add no-op stub queue methods to Write::Blocking so that
      applications don’t need to care whether a given IO object
      is blocking or not.

0.015 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Fixes for tests on Linux

0.016 Wed Apr 5 2017
    - Thanks to CHORNY: Fixes for Strawberry Perl and other OSes that
      treat EWOULDBLOCK as a separate error from EAGAIN.

0.017 Wed Apr 5 2017
    - Require the most recent IO::SigGuard in the MakeFile, which
      hopefully will fix some CPAN Testers test reports.

0.018 Wed Apr 5 2017
    - Tests: avoid blocking() on normally-created file handles since only
      Perl 5.14+ automatically upgrades file handles to IO::File.

0.02 Wed Apr 5 2017
    - Deprecate the Blocking/NonBlocking write classes. This radically
      simplifies the usage and allows clean switching back and forth between
      blocking (“unqueued”) and non-blocking (“queued”) writes.

0.021 Sun Apr 9 2017
    - Again tweak the tests for MSWin: drop new_from_fd() since it hangs.
      (thank you to CHORNY for pointing out the problem!)

0.03 Tue Jul 24 2017
    - Deprecate the ReadWrite class; reassign that functionality to
      the IO::Framed namespace.
    - allow_empty_read() to make read() not throw EmptyRead on an empty read.

0.031 Thu Nov 9 2017
    - Fix up some documentation. No code changes.
