version 0.002; 2023-04-07

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    more comprehensive coverage)

  * port to pre-5.9.5 Perl on Windows, where the Perl core's qerror()
    function isn't available to modules

  * port to Perl 5.21.4, where a GV op doesn't necessarily reference a GV

  * port to Perl 5.33.1, which defines a PERL_VERSION_GE() macro that
    clashes with the one this module previously had

  * skip thread tests on some old versions of Perl (around 5.10.0) where
    a core bug makes thread creation violate an internal assertion and
    causes crashes

  * skip thread tests on pre-5.8.9 Perls where a core bug makes thread
    creation corrupt memory

  * skip thread tests on pre-5.8.3 Perls where a core bug makes thread
    completion break the global PL_sv_placeholder

  * put whitespace around C string literals being pasted, for C++11
    compatibility

  * explicitly document that the affected operations are those that use
    the two mentioned hidden variables, and so that the list of affected
    operations is exhaustive

  * document that the module doesn't affect select(), ${^LAST_FH},
    readline(), <>, eof() (with the parenthesised empty argument list),
    or <<>>

  * avoid a compiler warning that arises on Perl 5.20

  * add an alarm to thread tests in case of infinite loop

  * refactor thread tests

  * in XS, refactor Perl version comparisons

  * in XS, better argument parenthesisation in a macro

version 0.001; 2017-07-30

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for not
    breaking version-implied features and for require argument context)

  * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
    necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7

  * in error messages, change "Implicit I/O handle" to "Unspecified
    I/O handle", because the module prevents the handle from being
    implicitly determined

  * in documentation, put the abstract in a more positive form

  * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution

  * in documentation, use four-column indentation for all verbatim
    material

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker

  * avoid some compiler warnings that arise on Perl 5.6

  * consistently use THX_ prefix on internal function names

version 0.000; 2012-02-17

  * initial released version
