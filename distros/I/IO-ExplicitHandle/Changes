version 0.001; 2017-07-30

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for not
    breaking version-implied features and for require argument context)

  * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
    necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7

  * in error messages, change "Implicit I/O handle" to "Unspecified
    I/O handle", because the module prevents the handle from being
    implicitly determined

  * in documentation, put the abstract in a more positive form

  * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution

  * in documentation, use four-column indentation for all verbatim
    material

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker

  * avoid some compiler warnings that arise on Perl 5.6

  * consistently use THX_ prefix on internal function names

version 0.000; 2012-02-17
