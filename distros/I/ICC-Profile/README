ICC-Profile

This set of modules is the color tool kit I developed as a consultant in the printing business. I use
it for solving one-off problems and testing new ideas. The software was developed on the OS X operating
system. I have tried to make it portable to other OS, but I cannot test, so there may be issues. Let me
know if you find bugs – I will try to fix them.

There are three optional XS modules written in C that require compiling. These work on OS X, but are
not ported to other OS. Therefore, I have not released them to CPAN. I would appreciate help getting
these to work on Windows and Unix.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
