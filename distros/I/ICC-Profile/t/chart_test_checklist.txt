notes:

- all of the shortcut methods have some basic tests. the 'xyz' method is missing from some test groups. there is XYZ data in the CMYK-Lab files.

- 'lab', 'xyz' and 'density' now have encoding options, which need testing.

- ASE and TIFF files can be written and read, so it is now possible to do round trip testing.
