=head1 NAME

IOMux::Handler::Write - any mux writer

=head1 INHERITANCE

 IOMux::Handler::Write
   is an IOMux::Handler

 IOMux::Handler::Write is extended by
   IOMux::Bundle
   IOMux::File::Write
   IOMux::Net::TCP
   IOMux::Pipe::Write

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # only use extensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In an event driven program, you must be careful with every Operation
System call, because it can block the event mechanism, hence the program
as a whole. Often you can be lazy with writes, because its communication
buffers are usually working quite asynchronous... but not always. You
may skip the callbacks for small writes and prints.

=head3 Writing

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<print>(STRING|SCALAR|LIST|ARRAY)

Send one or more lines to the output. The data is packed into a
single string first. The ARRAY (of strings) and SCALAR (ref string)
choices are available for efficiency.

example: 

  $conn->print($some_text);
  $conn->print(\$some_text);

  my $fh = $conn->fh;
  print $fh "%s%d%X", $foo, $bar, $baz;

=item $obj-E<gt>B<printf>($format, $params)

example: 

    $conn->printf("%s%d%X", $foo, $bar, $baz);

    my $fh = $conn->fh;
    $fh->printf("%s%d%X", $foo, $bar, $baz);

=item $obj-E<gt>B<say>(STRING|SCALAR|LIST|ARRAY)

Like L<print()|IOMux::Handler::Write/"Writing"> but adding a newline at the end.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<write>( SCALAR, [$more] )

Send the content of the string, passed as reference in SCALAR. You
probably want to use L<print()|IOMux::Handler::Write/"Writing"> or L<printf()|IOMux::Handler::Write/"Writing">.  You may provide
a code reference to produce $more info when the output buffer get
empty.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<muxOutbufferEmpty>()

Called after all pending output has been written to the file descriptor.
You may use this callback to produce more data to be written.

When this method is not overruled, the multiplexer will stop listening
to the write flag until an explicit L<write()|IOMux::Handler::Write/"Writing"> gets executed.

example: 

  package My::Service;
  use base 'IOMux::Net::TCP';

  sub muxOutbufferEmpty()
  {   my $self = shift;
      if(my $data = $self->produce_more_data)
      {   $self->write(\$data);
      }
      else
      {   $self->SUPER::muxOutbufferEmpty;
      }
  }

=item $obj-E<gt>B<muxOutputWaiting>()

Returns true is there is output queued.
