Revision history for Image-Square

1.0     16th September 2023
	- First public release
	- Gave up on using hashes to check images as each build of libgd seems to use a different value from copyResampled. 
	- Instead we now generate the images on the fly meaning no big payloads to download.
	- The checks are for initial size, upscaling and downscaling.
	- Makefile.PL contains META_MERGE section

0.01_4  13th September 2023
	- Tests still fail on different builds of GD.  Now using PNG as input image and native GD format for output.

0.01_3  12th September 2023
	- The previous tests failed due to the GD->jpeg method not being consistent across Perl versions.  Now we are using PNG images instead as these should be more consistent!
	- Added 'Error Handling' section to POD and reference to the GitHub repository.

0.01_2  7th September 2023
	- Added tests to check generated images against hashes of visually tested images.

0.01_1  6th September 2023
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
