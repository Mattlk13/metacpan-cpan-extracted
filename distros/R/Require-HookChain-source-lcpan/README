NAME
    Require::HookChain::source::lcpan - Load module from local CPAN mirror

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Require::HookChain::source::lcpan (from Perl distribution
    Require-HookChain-source-lcpan), released on 2023-02-08.

SYNOPSIS
    In Perl code:

     use Require::HookChain 'source::lcpan'; # optional extra arguments: $die, $tempdir
     use Ask; # will retrieve from local CPAN, even if it's installed

    On the command-line:

     # will retrieve from MetaCPAN if Ask is not installed
     % perl -MRHC=-end,1,source::lcpan -MAsk -E...

DESCRIPTION
    To use this, you must have a working local CPAN mirror managed by
    App::lcpan. Install that module first and follow its installation
    instruction.

    Optional extra import arguments:

    *   $die

        Bool, default true. If set to true, will die when failing to find
        and read module source from local CPAN mirror. Otherwise, will just
        decline to let Require::HookChain to other hooks.

    *   $tempdir

        Str. Location to extract CPAN distribution into. Defaults to
        "$TMPDIR/lcpan" where $TMPDIR is retrieved from
        "File::Spec->tmpdir". Under this directory is the subdirectory of
        name of distribution. And under that subdirectory is the extracted
        archive from each CPAN distribution retrieved from local CPAN
        mirror.

    Some other caveats:

    *   This module is most probably not suitable for use in production

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
