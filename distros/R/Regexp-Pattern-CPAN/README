NAME
    Regexp::Pattern::CPAN - Regexp patterns related to CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Regexp::Pattern::CPAN (from
    Perl distribution Regexp-Pattern-CPAN), released on 2018-09-02.

SYNOPSIS
     use Regexp::Pattern; # exports re()
     my $re = re("CPAN::pause_id");

DESCRIPTION
    Regexp::Pattern is a convention for organizing reusable regex patterns.

PATTERNS
    *   pause_id

        PAUSE author ID, or PAUSE ID for short.

        I'm not sure whether PAUSE allows digit for the first letter. For
        safety I'm assuming no.
