NAME
    Regexp::Pattern::CPAN - Regexp patterns related to CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Regexp::Pattern::CPAN (from
    Perl distribution Regexp-Pattern-CPAN), released on 2021-07-27.

SYNOPSIS
     use Regexp::Pattern; # exports re()
     my $re = re("CPAN::pause_id");

DESCRIPTION
    Regexp::Pattern is a convention for organizing reusable regex patterns.

REGEXP PATTERNS
    *   pause_id

        PAUSE author ID, or PAUSE ID for short.

        I'm not sure whether PAUSE allows digit for the first letter. For
        safety I'm assuming no.

        Examples:

        Example #1.

         "PERLANCAR" =~ re("CPAN::pause_id");  # matches

        Only allows uppercase.

         "perlancar" =~ re("CPAN::pause_id");  # DOESN'T MATCH

        too short.

         "A" =~ re("CPAN::pause_id");  # DOESN'T MATCH

        contains whitespace.

         "PERL ANCAR" =~ re("CPAN::pause_id", {-anchor=>1});  # DOESN'T MATCH

        too long.

         "RANDALSCHWARTZ" =~ re("CPAN::pause_id", {-anchor=>1});  # DOESN'T MATCH
