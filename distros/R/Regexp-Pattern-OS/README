    Regexp::Pattern::OS - Regexp patterns related to OS names and Perl's $^O

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Regexp::Pattern::OS (from Perl
    distribution Regexp-Pattern-OS), released on 2020-02-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Regexp::Pattern; # exports re()
     my $re = re("OS::os_is_known");

DESCRIPTION
    This is basically a glue to Perl::osnames.

PATTERNS
    *   os_is_known

        Check that operating system ($^O) is a known value.

        Examples:

         "linux" =~ re("OS::os_is_known");  # matches

         "MSWin32" =~ re("OS::os_is_known");  # matches

         "foo" =~ re("OS::os_is_known");  # doesn't match

    *   os_is_posix

        Check that operating system ($^O) is (mostly) POSIX compatible.

        Examples:

         "linux" =~ re("OS::os_is_posix");  # matches

         "MSWin32" =~ re("OS::os_is_posix");  # doesn't match

    *   os_is_unix

        Check that operating system ($^O) is a Unix.

        Examples:

         "linux" =~ re("OS::os_is_unix");  # matches

         "MSWin32" =~ re("OS::os_is_unix");  # doesn't match
