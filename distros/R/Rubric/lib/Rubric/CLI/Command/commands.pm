Rubric::CLI::Command::commands - list the rubric commands

=head1 VERSION

version 0.157

=head1 PERL VERSION

This code is effectively abandonware.  Although releases will sometimes be made
to update contact info or to fix packaging flaws, bug reports will mostly be
ignored.  Feature requests are even more likely to be ignored.  (If someone
takes up maintenance of this code, they will presumably remove this notice.)
This means that whatever version of perl is currently required is unlikely to
change -- but also that it might change at any new maintainer's whim.
