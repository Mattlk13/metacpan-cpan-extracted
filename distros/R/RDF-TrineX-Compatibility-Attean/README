NAME
    RDF::TrineX::Compatibility::Attean - Compatibility layer between Attean
    and RDF::Trine

SYNOPSIS
    In modules that have new Attean methods, but otherwise uses RDF::Trine,
    just go:

      use RDF::TrineX::Compatibility::Attean;

DESCRIPTION
    For now, only certain methods of Attean classes are supported. They are
    added to the respective RDF::Trine classes by this module. They are:

    *   `RDF::Trine::Node::equals`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Node::ntriples_string`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Node::Resource::abs`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Node::Literal::value`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Node::Literal::language`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Node::Literal::datatype`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Model::get_quads`

    *   `RDF::Trine::Model::count_quads`

TODO
    I'm unsure on how `RDF::Trine::Node::Literal::has_datatype` should be
    treated. Attean implements RDF 1.1, where all literals have a datatype, so
    to Attean, `has_datatype` would always be true, but that would be
    surprising to Trine users. For now, I have chosen to solve this only at
    the output level, i.e. the `RDF::Trine::Node::Literal::datatype` will
    return the RDF 1.1 datatypes, but `has_datatype` is still false for what
    was in RDF 1.0 plain literals and language literals.

BUGS
    One should be that this module is a hack to make legacy code run while
    being in transition to Attean. It was initially motivated by making
    RDF::RDFa::Generator run on both frameworks. It may do surprising things.

    Nevertheless, please report any bugs or things you miss from Attean here:
