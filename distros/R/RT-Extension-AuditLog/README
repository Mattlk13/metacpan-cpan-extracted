NAME
    RT-Extension-AuditLog - Log all RT access requests with username

DESCRIPTION
    In some environments, there are auditing requirements regarding access
    to the data in tickets. Modifications are already well preserved in the
    transaction history of a ticket, but read access is not tracked by
    native RT facilities.

    There is the webserver log, but that does not include the user-name in
    all cases.
