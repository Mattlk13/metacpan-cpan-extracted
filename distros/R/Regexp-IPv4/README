SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::IPv4 qw($IPv4_re);
    
     $address =~ /^$IPv4_re$/ and print "IPv4 address\n";

DESCRIPTION

    The regex only recognizes the quad-dotted notation of four decimal
    integers, ranging from 0 to 255 each. Other notations like 32-bit
    hexadecimal number (e.g. 0xFF0000) or shortened dotted notation (e.g.
    255.0.0) are not recognized.

    If you do not use anchor, beware of cases like:

     "255.255.255.256" =~ /($IPv4_re)/; # true & capture "255.255.255.25"
