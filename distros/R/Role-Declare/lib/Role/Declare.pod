=head1 NAME

Role::Declare - declarative parameter and return type checking


=head1 SYNOPSIS

In the interface Role:

    package My::Class::interface;

    use Role::Declare;
    use Types::Standard qw/:all/;

    class_method create_object ( Str $name, Int $age ) : Return( InstanceOf['My::Class'] ) {
        die "Age cannot be negative: $age" if $age < 0;
    };

In the interface implementation:

    package My::Class;
    use Role::Declare::StrictWith;

    with_strict 'My::Class::interface';

    sub create_object { ... }

or:

    package My::Class;
    use Role::Tiny::With;

    with 'My::Class::interface';

    sub create_object { ... }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl doesn't provide a way to describe an interface,
much less validate its implementation. This module aims to fill that gap
by providing an easy way to build a validation layer with subroutine
attributes and L<Function::Parameters> syntax.

=head2 How it works

Any package which uses L<Role::Declare> becomes a role and receives a few
keywords and attributes that generate method modifiers. This means any
class which composes it will need to implement the listed methods (this
will be enforced on composition). Method implementations will be affected
by L<Class::MethodModifiers> modifiers, which provide argument and return
value type checking, as well as arbitrary assertions defined in the interface.

Having that validation layer on at all times introduces a performance penalty.
It makes sense to keep it on during development and testing to catch bugs
and remove it in production. L<Role::Declare::StrictWith> provides a specialized
version of L<Role::Tiny>'s C<with> function, which works only in test environments
as defined by L<Devel::StrictMode>.

=head2 A note about void context

Return type validation will never be triggered in void context.
Even if a method unconditionally returns a value and a L<:Return> attribute
is used, void context calls will not be validated.

=head2 Lax mode

L<Role::Declare> can be imported in lax mode:

  use Role::Declare -lax;

this will disable argument count checks, similar to L<Function::Parameters>
C<:lax> tag. It will affect all exported keywords.

B<WARNING>: This functionality is experimental and subject to abrupt changes.

=head1 EXPORTS

The following are exported into the callers namespace:

=head2 method

    method $method ( $Type $foo, $Type $bar ) { ... }

A method declaration following the syntax of L<Function::Parameters>
- a list of parameters that can have type constraints,
like those from L<Type::Tiny>. C<$self> will be automatically provided.

The body can contain any checks that need to be done on the arguments
B<before> the method is executed, it will not overwrite the method itself.

=head2 class_method

    class_method $method ( $Type $foo, $Type $bar ) { ... }

Like L<method>, but instead of C<$self> generates a C<$class> variable,
which must be of the type C<ClassName>, from L<Types::Standard>.

=head2 instance_method

    instance_method $method ( $Type $foo, $Type $bar ) { ... }

Like L<method>, but requries C<$self> to be an C<Object> from L<Types::Standard>.

=head2 :Return

This attribute can be used along with L<method>, L<instance_method> or L<class_method>
to add return value validation in scalar context (see L<:ReturnList> for list context).
It takes a single L<Type::Tiny> constraint as an argument.

    class_method $method ( $Type $foo, $Type $bar ) : Return( $Type ) { ... }

=head2 :ReturnMaybe

Same as L<:Return> but allows C<undef>.

=head2 :ReturnList

Similar to L<:Return> but gets triggered by list context returns.
It's arguments are the same as for L<ArrayRef> constraint from L<Type::Tiny>.

    class_method $method ( $Type $foo, $Type $bar ) : ReturnList( $Type ) { ... }

=head2 :ReturnMaybeList

Same as L<:ReturnList> but will always allow an empty list.

=head2 :ReturnSelf

Require the method to return its invocant.

=head2 :ReturnMaybeSelf

Same as L<:ReturnSelf> but allow C<undef>.

=head2 :ReturnObject

Shorthand for C<:Return(Object)>.

=head2 :ReturnMaybeObject

Same as L<:ReturnObject> but allows C<undef>.

=head2 :ReturnInstanceOf

Require the method to return an instance of the specified class.
C<:ReturnInstanceOf($class)> is equivalent to C<:Return(InstanceOf[$class])>.

=head2 :ReturnMaybeInstanceOf

Same as L<:ReturnInstanceOf> but allows C<undef>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 A [list|scalar] hook for $method already exists

For each method at most two return validations can be set up - one for list
and one for scalar context. This means, you can specify both C<:Return(...)>
and C<:ReturnList(...)> for a method but you can't use
C<:ReturnMaybeList> and C<:ReturnList> at the same time.

=head2 Only a single constraint is supported

A C<:Return> attribute should have a single argument - a L<Types::Standard>
constraint. If you want to test a method for multiple different types,
see L<Type::Tiny::Union>.

=head2 List constraint not defined

A C<:ReturnList> or C<:ReturnMaybeList> was used without arguments,
see C<ArrayRef> in L<Types::Standard> for supported arguments.
