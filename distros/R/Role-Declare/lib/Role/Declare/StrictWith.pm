=head1 NAME

Role::Declare::StrictWith - conditional role composition

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::New::Role;
    use Role::Declare::StrictWith;

    with_strict 'My::New::Interface';

Which is equivalent to:

    package My::New::Role;
    use Role::Tiny::With;;
    use Devel::StrictMode;

    with 'My::New::Interface' if STRICT;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides B<with_strict> - a version of L<Role::Tiny::With>'s
L<with> which only works when L<Devel::StrictMode> is on.
If B<STRICT> is not enabled, B<with_strict> is a no-op.
