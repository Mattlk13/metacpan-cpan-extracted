=head1 NAME

Role::Declare::Should - skip some checks when not testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::New::Role;
    use Role::Declare::Should;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a drop-in replacement for L<Role::Declare> which will
additionally disable argument count and type checks when not running
in a test environment, as determined by L<Devel::StrictMode>.

If B<STRICT> is enabled, using L<Role::Declare::Should> is functionally
identical to L<Role::Declare> (any import arguments are passed on).

If B<STRICT> is not enabled, it's equivalent to:

  use Role::Declare -lax, -no_type_check;
