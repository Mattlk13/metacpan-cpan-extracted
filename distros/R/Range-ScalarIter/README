NAME
    Range::ScalarIter - Generate a tied-scalar iterator for range

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Range::ScalarIter (from Perl
    distribution Range-ScalarIter), released on 2019-05-12.

SYNOPSIS
      use Range::ScalarIter qw(range_scalariter);

      my $iter = range_scalariter(1, 10);
      while (defined(my $i = $$iter>)) { ... } # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

    You can add step:

     my $iter = range_scalariter(1, 10, 2); # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

    You can use alphanumeric strings too since "++" has some extra builtin
    magic (see perlop):

     $iter = range_scalariter("zx", "aab"); # zx, zy, zz, aaa, aab

    Infinite list:

     $iter = range_scalariter(1, Inf); # 1, 2, 3, ...

DESCRIPTION
    PROOF OF CONCEPT.

    This module offers a tied-scalar-based iterator. It's most probably
    useful as a proof of concept only.

FUNCTIONS
  range_scalariter($start, $end [ , $step ]) => scalar
