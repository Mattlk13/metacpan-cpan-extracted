    This document describes RosettaCode version 0.0.15.

SYNOPSIS

    From the command line:

        > rosettacode help
        > git clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData
        > cd RosettaCodeData
        > rosettacode sync .

DESCRIPTION

    RosettaCode.org is a fantastic wiki that contains ~ 750 programming
    tasks, each implemented in up to ~ 550 programming languages.

    This tool aims to make it easier for programmers to obtain and try the
    various code samples.

    At this point, the main function is to extract the code examples and
    put them into a git repository on GitHub. You probably don't need to
    use this tool yourself. You can just get the repository here:

        git clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData

    This tool will just update all the files in that repository.
