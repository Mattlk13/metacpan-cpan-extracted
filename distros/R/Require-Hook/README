NAME
    Require::Hook - Namespace for require() hooks

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Require::Hook (from Perl
    distribution Require-Hook), released on 2023-04-22.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: Please see Require::HookChain instead which largely supersedes
    this.

    As one already understands, Perl lets you put coderefs or objects in
    @INC as "hooks". This lets you do all sorts of things when it comes to
    loading modules, for example:

    *   faking that a module does not exist when it does

        This can be used for testing.

    *   loading module from various sources

        You can load module source from the DATA section or variables, as is
        done in a fatpacked script. Or you can retrieve module source from
        CPAN so a script can magically run without installing extra CPAN
        modules.

    *   munging source code

        Like adding some Perl code before ("use strict;") or after, for
        testing purpose or otherwise.

    *   decrypt from an ecrypted source

    In the case of objects, perl will call your "INC" method. So this is how
    you would write a module for a require hook:

     package My::INCHandler;
     sub new { ... }
     sub My::INCHandler::INC {
         my ($self, $filename) = @_;
         ...
     }
     1;

    "Require::Hook" is just a namespace to put and share all your require
    hooks.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
