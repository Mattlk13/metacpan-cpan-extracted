=head1 METHODS

=head2 equals

B<Signature>:

  $self->equals(CowlOntologyId $rhs)

B<Params>:

  CowlOntologyId $lhs 
  CowlOntologyId $rhs 

Documentation:

  Equality function.
  
  @param lhs LHS of the equality relation.
  @param rhs RHS of the equality relation.
  @return True if the equality relation holds, false otherwise.
  
  @note Ontology IDs are considered equal if they have the same ontology IRI and version IRI.
        Since OWL 2 allows for both the ontology and version IRIs to be simultaneously empty,
        in that case the ontology IDs are considered different unless they are the same instance.
