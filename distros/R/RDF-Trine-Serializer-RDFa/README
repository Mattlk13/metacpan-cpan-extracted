NAME
    RDF::Trine::Serializer::RDFa - RDFa Serializer for RDF::Trine

SYNOPSIS
     use RDF::Trine::Serializer;

     my $s = RDF::Trine::Serializer->new('RDFa', style => 'HTML::Hidden');
     my $string = $s->serialize_model_to_string($model);

DESCRIPTION
    The RDF::Trine::Serializer class provides an API for serializing RDF
    graphs to strings and files. This subclass provides RDFa serialization via
    RDF::RDFa::Generator.

    It is intended that this module will replace the RDF::Trine compatibility
    methods in RDF::RDFa::Generator, which are now deprecated. This is done to
    allow both RDF::Trine and Attean to use it, but not require them as
    dependencies.

METHODS
    Beyond the methods documented below, this class inherits methods from the
    RDF::Trine::Serializer class.

    `new`
        Returns a new RDFa serializer object. It can any arguments are passed
        on to RDF::RDFa::Generator, see it's documentation for details. This
        includes a `style` argument that names a module that formats the
        output. In addition, a `generator_options` argument may be passed.
        This is passed to the generator's `create_document` methods as
        options, and are typically used for style-specific configuration.

    `serialize_model_to_file ( $fh, $model )`
        Serializes the $model to RDFa, printing the results to the supplied
        filehandle `<$fh`>.

    `serialize_model_to_string ( $model )`
        Serializes the $model to RDFa, returning the result as a string.

    `serialize_iterator_to_file ( $file, $iter )`
        Serializes the iterator to RDFa, printing the results to the supplied
        filehandle `<$fh`>.

    `serialize_iterator_to_string ( $iter )`
        Serializes the iterator to RDFa, returning the result as a string.

    Williams respectively.
