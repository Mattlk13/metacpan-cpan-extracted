NAME
    Role::TinyCommons::Tree - Roles related to object tree

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.128 of Role::TinyCommons::Tree (from
    Perl distribution Role-TinyCommons-Tree), released on 2021-10-07.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides several roles you can use to create a tree
    class. The roles are designed for maximum reusability and minimum
    clashes with your existing class.

    To create a tree class, all you need to do is apply the
    Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node role:

     use Role::Tiny::With;
     with 'Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node';

    The Tree::Node common role just requires you to have two methods:
    "parent" (which should return parent node object) and "children" (which
    should return a list or arrayref of children node objects).

    Utility methods such as "descendants", "walk", "is_first_child" and so
    on are separated to Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods which you can
    apply if you want.

    The actual methods in Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods are actually
    implemented in Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods, so you can import
    them to your class manually or just call the routines as a normal
    function call if you do not want to involve Role::Tiny. See an example
    of this usage in Data::CSel.

    Tree::Simple or Data::Tree, but at the time of this writing there isn't
    a tree role.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
