NAME
    Role::TinyCommons::Tree - Roles related to object tree

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.124 of Role::TinyCommons::Tree (from
    Perl distribution Role-TinyCommons-Tree), released on 2020-04-14.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides several roles you can use to create a tree
    class. The roles are designed for maximum reusability and minimum
    clashes with your existing class.

    To create a tree class, all you need to do is apply the
    Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node role:

     use Role::Tiny::With;
     with 'Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node';

    The Tree::Node common role just requires you to have two methods:
    "parent" (which should return parent node object) and "children" (which
    should return a list or arrayref of children node objects).

    Utility methods such as "descendants", "walk", "is_first_child" and so
    on are separated to Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods which you can
    apply if you want.

    The actual methods in Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods are actually
    implemented in Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods, so you can import
    them to your class manually or just call the routines as a normal
    function call if you do not want to involve Role::Tiny. See an example
    of this usage in Data::CSel.
