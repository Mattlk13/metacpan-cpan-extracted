SYNOPSIS

    In your Dist::Zilla plugin, e.g. in munge_files():

     sub munge_files {
         my $self = shift;
    
         local @INC = (Require::Hook::DzilBuild->new(zilla => $self->zilla), @INC);
         require Foo::Bar; # will be searched from build files, if exist
    
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION

    This is the Require::Hook version of the same functionality found in
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild.

    It looks for files from lib/ and . of Dist::Zilla build files.
