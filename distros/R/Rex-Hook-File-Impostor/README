NAME

    Rex::Hook::File::Impostor - execute Rex file management commands on a
    copy of the original file

VERSION

    version v0.1.1

SYNOPSIS

        use Rex::Hook::File::Impostor;

DESCRIPTION

    This module lets Rex <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex> execute file
    management commands on a copy of the file instead of the original one.

    This could be particularly useful when it is loaded conditionally to be
    combined with other modules. For example together with
    Rex::Hook::File::Diff <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Hook::File::Diff>,
    it could be used to show a diff of file changes without actually
    changing the original file contents.

    It works by installing a before hook
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#Hooks> for file commands,
    which makes a copy of the original file into a temporary directory, and
    then overrides the original arguments of the file commands
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#file>.

DIAGNOSTICS

    This module does not do any error checking (yet).

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

    It uses the same temporary directory that is used by Rex. Therefore it
    can be configured with set_tmp_dir
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Config#set_tmp_dir>:

        Rex::Config->set_tmp_dir($tmp_dir);

    This module does not use any environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES

    See the included cpanfile.
