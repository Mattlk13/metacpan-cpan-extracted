SYNOPSIS

     {
         local @INC = (@INC, Require::Hook::MetaCPAN->new);
         require Foo::Bar; # will be searched from MetaCPAN
         # ...
     }

DESCRIPTION

METHODS

 new([ %args ]) => obj

    Constructor. Known arguments:

      * die => bool (default: 1)

      If set to 1 (the default) will die if module source code can't be
      fetched (e.g. the module does not exist on CPAN, or there is network
      error). If set to 0, will simply decline so require() will try the
      next entry in @INC.

    Other Require::Hook::* modules.
