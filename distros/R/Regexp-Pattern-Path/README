SYNOPSIS
     use Regexp::Pattern; # exports re()

DESCRIPTION
    Regexp::Pattern is a convention for organizing reusable regex patterns.

PATTERNS
    *   filename_unix

        Valid filename pattern on Unix.

        Length must be 1-255 characters. The only characters not allowed
        include "\0" (null) and "/" (forward slash, for path separator).

        Examples:

         "foo" =~ re("Path::filename_unix");  # matches

         "foo bar" =~ re("Path::filename_unix");  # matches

        Too short.

         "" =~ re("Path::filename_unix");  # doesn't match

        Too long.

         "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" =~ re("Path::filename_unix");  # doesn't match

        contains slash.

         "foo/bar" =~ re("Path::filename_unix");  # doesn't match

        contains null (\0).

         "foo\0" =~ re("Path::filename_unix");  # doesn't match
