NAME
    RT-Extension-AttachmentFilter - Set forbidden attachments file names or
    extensions

DESCRIPTION
    Ses RT extension allows to forbid some files names or extensions from
    web attachment upload.

    It's use may be to match an existing mail policy.

    The filter can be defined per queue so queues that do not have outgoing
    emails configured can have less restrictions.

    See the configuration example under "INSTALLATION".

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::AttachmentFilter');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::AttachmentFilter));

        or add "RT::Extension::AttachmentFilter" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

        Then configure the limits using the $AttachmentFilter config option.
        This option takes the generic form of:

            Set( $AttachmentFilter, 
                '*'    => 'regexp',
                queue1 => 'regexp',
            );

        which allows to set limit per queue. '*' means for all queues that
        do not have a specific filter.

        'regexp' is a perl regular expression against the filename.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
