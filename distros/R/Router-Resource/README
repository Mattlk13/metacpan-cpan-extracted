Router::Resource

There are a bunch of path routers on CPAN, but they tend not to be very
RESTy. A basic idea of a RESTful API is that URIs point to resources and
the standard HTTP methods indicate the actions to be taken on those
resources. So to encourage you to think about it that way,
Router::Resource requires that you declare resources and then the HTTP
methods that are implemented for those resources.

The rules for matching paths are defined by Router::Simple's routing
rules, which offer quite a lot of flexibility.
