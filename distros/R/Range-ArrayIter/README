NAME
    Range::ArrayIter - Generate a tied-array iterator for range

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Range::ArrayIter (from Perl
    distribution Range-ArrayIter), released on 2019-04-17.

SYNOPSIS
      use Range::ArrayIter qw(range_arrayiter);

      my $iter = range_arrayiter(1, 10);
      for (@$iter) { ... } # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

    You can add step:

     my $iter = range_arrayiter(1, 10, 2); # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

    Anything that can be incremented by Perl is game:

      $iter = range_arrayiter("a", "e"); # a, b, c, d, e

DESCRIPTION
    PROOF OF CONCEPT.
