NAME
    RT-Extension-7zDownload - Download attachment as encrypted 7z file

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes, especially when using RTIR for CSIRT work, attachments of
    tickets might contain malware.

    It is unwise to download such files directly to the user's workstation.
    The usual convention is to zip the potentially malicious file into a
    password-protected zip / 7z file with the well-known password
    "infected".

RT VERSION
    Tested with RT 5.0.3.

    As this extension replaces a Mason component, it is pretty version-
    dependent.

    Check the lines after "RT-Extension-7zDownload Starts here" in
    html/Ticket/Elements/ShowAttachments, it should be easy to make the same
    changes to other versions of RT.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

        For RT Versions other than 5.0.3, replace the supplied
        ShowAttachments file with a patched version of the local RT
        installation.

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::7zDownload');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
