DESCRIPTION

    Role::EventEmitter is a simple Role::Tiny role for event emitting
    objects based on Mojo::EventEmitter. This role can be applied to any
    hash-based object class such as those created with Class::Tiny, Moo, or
    Moose.

EVENTS

    Role::EventEmitter can emit the following events.

 error

      $e->on(error => sub {
        my ($e, $err) = @_;
        ...
      });

    This is a special event for errors, it will not be emitted directly by
    this role but is fatal if unhandled.

      $e->on(error => sub {
        my ($e, $err) = @_;
        say "This looks bad: $err";
      });
