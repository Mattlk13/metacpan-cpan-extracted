Random-Skew version 0.01
========================

Generate random data with skewed likelihood, without consuming
all your RAM with a ridiculously huge array.

  use Random::Skew;
  Random::Skew::GRAIN( 72 ); # or whatever
  my $rs = Random::Skew->new(
    abundance => 1_000_000,
    plenty    =>    56_789,
    some      =>     1_234,
    scarce    =>        57,
    rare      =>        11,
    unheardof =>         3,
  );

  while ( ... ) {
      my $item = $rs->item;
      ...
  }

To see what freqeuncy your returned values tend to be:
  my %v;
  my $ct = 1_000_000; # or higher, why not?
  $v{ $rs->item }++ while $ct-- > 0;
  print map { "$_\t$v{$_}\n" }
        sort {$v{$b} <=> $v{$a}}
        keys %v;
