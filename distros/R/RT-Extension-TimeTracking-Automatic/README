NAME
    RT-Extension-TimeTracking-Automatic

RT VERISION
    Works with RT 4.2 and RT 4.4, as well as RTIR

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May require root permissions to install

    Edit /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        To enable the extension add the following line to the
        RT_SiteConfig.pm file:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::TimeTracking::Automatic');

        If you would like to set a default amount of time to account for
        basic overhead you can set a config value to the number of minutes
        to add by default:

            Set($TimeTrackingAdjustment, 10);   # automatically add 10 minutes to each update

        This setting is optional and will default to 0 additional minutes.

    Patching RTIR
        If you are using RTIR-3.2.0 apply the following patches:

            patch -d /path/to/rtir -p1 < patches/patch-rtir-3.2.patch
            patch -d /path/to/rtir -p1 < patches/incident_create_callback.patch
            cd /path/to/rtir && make install

        These add callbacks and it is safe to leave them in place should you
        disable automatic time tracking.

    Clear the mason cache
        To clear your cache run the following command:

            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj/*

    Restart the webserver
        Restart the websever to have the extension take affect.

DESCRIPTION
    RT::Extension::TimeTracking::Automatic automatically tracks time when
    creating, commenting on, or replying to a ticket. The time spent editing
    the ticket will update the TimeWorked on the Ticket itself, and create a
    transaction logging how long the user took to comment on or reply to the
    ticket.
