NAME
    Range::Iter - Generate a coderef iterator for range

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Range::Iter (from Perl
    distribution Range-Iter), released on 2019-04-23.

SYNOPSIS
      use Range::Iter qw(range_iter);

      my $iter = range_iter(1, 10);
      while (my $val = $iter->()) { ... } # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

    You can add step:

     my $iter = range_iter(1, 10, 2); # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

    You can use alphanumeric strings too since "++" has some extra builtin
    magic (see perlop):

     $iter = range_iter("zx", "aab"); # zx, zy, zz, aaa, aab

    Infinite list:

     $iter = range_iter(1, Inf); # 1, 2, 3, ...

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  range_iter($start, $end) => coderef
