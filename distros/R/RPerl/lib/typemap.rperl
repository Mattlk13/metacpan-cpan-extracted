# VERSION 0.007_000
# NEED FIX, CORRELATION #rp002: bug, possibly in Inline, causing inability to declare 3rd count_FOO argument to T_PACKEDARRAY; temporarily solved here
# DEV NOTE: all comments must be on their own line or typemapping will silently fail and typemapped subroutines will fail to bind from Inline to Perl
# DEV NOTE, CORRELATION #rp051: hard-coded list of RPerl data types and data structures
