=head1 PREFACE

=head2 Section 0.1: Who I Am

My name is William N. Braswell, Jr.; I am also known by a number of other names including Will the Chill, The Voice In The Wilderness, Skipper Brassie ("braz-ee"), and just Will.

I have a degree in computer science and mathematics from Texas Tech University, I have worked as a Perl software developer for over 15 years, and I am the founder of the Auto-Parallel Technologies consulting company.

L<LinkedIn Profile|https://www.linkedin.com/in/williambraswell>

L<GitHub Profile|https://github.com/wbraswell>

I am 1 of 3 co-founders of the Perl 11 movement.

L<Perl11.org|http://perl11.org/>

I am also the President of the Austin Perl Mongers.

L<Austin.pm|http://austin.pm>

Most importantly, I am the creator of the RPerl optimizing compiler for Perl 5, about which you are currently reading!

L<RPerl.org|http://rperl.org>

=head2 Section 0.2: Why I Wrote This Book

Using RPerl is different enough from normal Perl 5 to necessitate the creation of in-depth user documentation.

Manual pages and cookbooks and example source code alone are not enough, only a full textbook can provide the level of detail necessary to truly learn RPerl.

This is that textbook.

=head2 Section 0.3: History Of This Book

RPerl v1.0 was released on US Independence Day, July 4th, 2015; 6 days later, work began on the source code solution to exercise 1 of chapter 1 of this book:

L<First Learning RPerl Commit on GitHub|https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/commit/8c3dec4448fbed6bba04f92f9f23759c5512f2e9>

Significant GitHub commit dates may be viewed by forking the RPerl git repository and executing the following C<git> command:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ git log --reverse --all --date=short --pretty='%cd: %s' | grep 'Learning RPerl'

=head2 Section 0.5: Acknowledgements & Thanks

Countless people have contributed to the development of RPerl; from source code to bug testing to financial donations to emotional support, it truly takes a village to build a compiler!

Below are the contents of the official RPerl thank-you file, listing the handles (online nicknames) and names of the most important RPerl contributors.  If you don't already know who these people are, you will be pleasantly surprised by researching each of them.

=head2 Section 0.6: Defense / Apology

I'm sure I will make errors while writing this book.

I may even upset some people, particularly those who have an emotional or financial investment in slow Perl software.

Despite my best efforts, I remain a fallible human being; thus, bad spelling and grammer and run-on sentences and parts that are hard to understand and parts that are not funny and formattiNg errors and bad spelling adn repetitions and other annoyances will doubtless plague this tome but we must not allow such trivialities as, improper punctuation to affect our willingness and ability to learn how to write super-fast RPerl software.

If you find a mistake in this book (other than in the immediately preceding paragraph), please utilize the following link to create a new GitHub issue (bug report) using a title starting with the words "Learning RPerl":

L<New GitHub Issue|https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/issues/new>

I will try my best to create an engaging and educational experience for you, the reader; however, in anticipation of the inevitable disappointment you may experience, I can only humbly offer...

B<I'M SORRY!>

=head1 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

=head2 Section 1.1: Welcome To The Roadrunner Book!

You are about to learn the basic concepts of writing software using the RPerl optimizing compiler for the Perl computer programming language.  With the skills gained by reading this book, you will be empowered to create new super-fast RPerl programs which can be intermixed with the enormous amount of existing Perl software available on the Internet.

This book is named and stylized for the animal mascot for RPerl, Roadie the Roadrunner.  RPerl, like Roadie, I<"runs really fast">.

Throughout this text, the following 14 typography conventions are utilized:

=head2 Section 1.2: Learning Perl

=begin text

This book is purposefully patterned after the popular educational text B<Learning Perl>, affectionately known as the Llama Book.  Both the Roadrunner Book and the Llama book are meant as introductory texts on Perl topics.  The Llama Book is focused on normal Perl, and the Roadrunner Book is focused on optimized Perl.

This book copies the same chapter topics as B<Learning Perl>, but all content is re-written for RPerl.  B<Learning RPerl> also copies the same exercise concepts as B<Learning Perl>, but all solutions are re-written in RPerl.  Both books are canonical and may be used together in the classroom; the source code solutions are meant to be compared side-by-side as textbook examples of normal Perl versus optimized Perl.

Please support the Perl community by purchasing a copy of B<Learning Perl, 7th Edition> from our friends at O'Reilly:

=head2 Section 1.3: Is This Book A Good Choice For You?

=over

=item * Are you totally new to computer programming, and you want to learn how to write your first program?

=item * Do you already know Perl, and now you want to make your Perl code run faster?

=item * Do you already know some other computer language, and Perl has always intrigued you?

=item * Do you love learning about new languages and compilers?

=item * Do you miss your favorite old language Perl, and you're looking for a legitimate reason to go back?

=item * Are you a scientist and you just want your code to run really fast without the headaches of C or C++?

=back

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then the Roadrunner Book is definitely for you!

If you answered "no" to all of these questions, then this book may still be for you, give it a try!

If you hate Perl, or only love slow software, or wish all computers would explode, then we suggest some soul-searching and a L<few|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UScm9avQM1Y> L<Saint|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKqBmAHwSkg> L<Larry|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G49RUPv5-NU> L<videos|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNAtbYSxzuA>.  You'll thank us in the morning.

=head2 Section 1.4: Why Aren't There More Footnotes?

This is a purposefully simple book, in the same way RPerl is a purposefully simple subset of the full Perl 5 programming language.

=head2 Section 1.5: What About Educational Programming Exercises?

There are one or more programming exercises at the end of every chapter, and full answers to each problem are given near the end of the book in Appendix A.

For maximum educational effect, we suggest you attempt to write each piece of code on your own before looking at our solutions.

If you are using this as an official textbook for certification or academic credit, such as at LAMPuniversity.org or a traditional school, you are obviously expected to write all your own code without referring to our or anyone else's solutions whatsoever.  We suggest you enclose Appendix A with a paper clip or discard it altogether to avoid the potential for accidental academic dishonesty.

=head2 Section 1.6: How Long Should Each Exercise Take To Complete?

The numbers at the beginning of each exercise indicate the approximate number of minutes required for an average person to reach a full working solution.  If it takes you less time, good for you!  If it takes you more time, don't worry, it's no big deal; learning technical skills requires time and dedication.  All experts were once novices.

=head2 Section 1.7: What If I Want To Teach RPerl?

Thank you for helping spread the love of Perl and the speed of RPerl!

As previously mentioned, this book may either be used solo or combined with the Llama Book.  For students who are not already familiar with Perl, you may wish to use this text alone in order to simplify and ease the learning experience.  For students who are already familiar with Perl or other dynamic programming languages like the snake or the red gemstone, you may wish to use both textbooks for a more in-depth compare-and-contrast approach.

=head2 Section 1.8: What Does The Name RPerl Actually Mean?

RPerl stands for I<"Restricted Perl">, in that we restrict our use of Perl to those parts which can be made to run fast.  RPerl also stands for I<"Revolutionary Perl">, in that we hope RPerl's speed will revolutionize the software development industry, or at least the Perl community.  RPerl might even stand for I<"Roadrunner Perl">, in that it I<runs really fast>.

=head2 Section 1.9: Why Did Will Invent RPerl?

Will loves Perl and the Perl community.

Will is a scientist and needs his code to run really fast.

Will doesn't like the hassle of writing code in C or C++ or XS or Inline::C or Inline::CPP.

Will waited a decade or two before realizing he had to do it himself.

=head2 Section 1.10: Why Didn't Will Just Use Normal Perl?

Dynamic languages like Perl are fast at running some kinds of computational actions, such as regular expressions (text data pattern matching) and reading from a database.

Unfortunately, dynamic languages are slow at running general-purpose computations, such as arithmetic and moving data around in memory.  Sometimes very slow.

Dynamic languages like Perl are also flexible, powerful, and relatively easy to learn.  Sometimes too flexible.

RPerl's goal is to keep all of Perl's power and ease-of-use, while removing the redundant parts of Perl's flexibility in order to gain a major runtime speed boost.

The most complex and flexible parts of Perl are called I<"high magic">, so RPerl is focused on supporting the I<"low magic"> parts of Perl which can be made to run fast.

=head2 Section 1.11: Is RPerl Simple Or Complicated?

RPerl is specifically designed to remove the confusing and overly-complicated parts of Perl.

RPerl also introduces a number of additional rules and templates which are not present in normal Perl, notably including the use of real data types.

The net effect of removing Perl complexity and adding RPerl rules falls in favor of RPerl, due primarily to the exceedingly complex nature of Perl.

In other words, RPerl is easier to learn and use than dynamic languages like normal Perl, and most any other language in general.

=head2 Section 1.12: How Is RPerl Being Promoted?

The RPerl team has been regularly promoting RPerl in a number of physical and digital venues, including but not limited to:

=head2 Section 1.13: What Is The RPerl Community Up To?

As of US Independence Day 2016, RPerl v2.0 (codename I<Pioneer>) has been publicly released and is in use by a number of early adopters around the world.

RPerl development is proceeding with financial support from both Kickstarter crowdfunding and official grant monies from The Perl Foundation.

The RPerl community is beginning to grow, and there are a number of exciting RPerl projects currently in the works.

If you would like to create software libraries and applications (AKA "programs" or "apps") to be utilized by end-users, then please join the RPerl application developers group, also known as the "RPerl App Devs":

=head2 Section 1.14: What Is RPerl Meant To Do?

RPerl is a general-purpose programming language, which means you can use RPerl to efficiently and effectively implement virtually any kind of software you can imagine.

RPerl is especially well-suited for building software which benefits from speed, such as scientific simulations and graphical video games.

RPerl is also good for building software which utilizes Perl's strong-suit of string manipulation; RPerl currently supports basic string operators, with full regular expression support to be added in an upcoming version.

=head2 Section 1.15: What Is RPerl Not Meant To Do?

RPerl has purposefully disabled the most complex features of Perl, such as runtime code evaluation, secret operators, and punctuation variables.  If you have purposefully designed your Perl software to depend on these high-magic features, or you are unconditionally committed to continue using high-magic language features, then maybe RPerl isn't for you.

=head2 Section 1.16: How Can I Download & Install RPerl?

Installing RPerl ranges from easy to difficult, depending on how well your operating system supports Perl and C++.

On modern operating systems with good Perl support, such as Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux, you should be able to install RPerl system-wide by running the following command at your terminal command prompt:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ sudo cpan RPerl

=for rperl X</noncode>

You may also choose to use the C<`cpanm`> command for simplicity, or the C<local::lib> tool for single-user (not system-wide) installation, both of which are included in the INSTALL notes document linked below.

If RPerl is properly installed, you should see a short text message displayed when you type the following command:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -v

=for rperl X</noncode>

On operating systems with less Perl support, you may have to perform a number of steps to successfully install RPerl, with dry technical detail available in the INSTALL notes document:

L<https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/blob/master/INSTALL>

Unless you are an experienced programmer or system administrator, it is B<strongly> recommended you use the Xubuntu operating system.  You can download the Xubuntu ISO file at the link below, then use it to create a bootable DVD disc or USB flash drive, install Xubuntu onto any computer, and issue the C<`sudo cpan RPerl`> command as described above.

L<http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu>

If you are interested in viewing the source code of RPerl itself, you may find the latest major release of RPerl (stable) on CPAN:

L<https://metacpan.org/author/WBRASWELL>

You may find the latest development release of RPerl (possibly unstable) on Github:

L<https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl>

=head2 Section 1.17: Where Is Perl Software Stored Online?

CPAN is the I<"Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">, the world's most successful and mature centralized software network.

CPAN servers are where most public Perl software is stored, including RPerl.

L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN>

L<http://www.cpan.org>

Several other programming language communities have copied the success and implementation of CPAN, including JSAN for Javascript, CRAN for R, and CCAN for C.

=head2 Section 1.18: How Can I Obtain Technical Support For RPerl?

Official RPerl technical support is provided through Auto-Parallel Technologies, Inc.

=head2 Section 1.19: Are There Any Free Technical Support Options?

Free technical support for non-commercial users is provided by the RPerl community through Internet Relay Chat.

=head2 Section 1.20: Are There Any Bugs In RPerl?

All software has small (or large) problems called I<"bugs">, and depending on who is marketing the software, they may even tell you some of the bugs are actually "features"!

RPerl is a work in progress, and may contain a number of bugs, both known and unknown.  If you find a bug in RPerl, we would love to hear about it!

The primary bug-tracking platform for RPerl is Github Issues, where you may file a new bug report ("new issue") if it is not already listed:

L<https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/issues>

Please be sure to include all of the following information in your bug report:

=over

=item * Pertinent Problem Message Output, If Long Use L<https://gist.github.com/>

=item * Operating System Version C<`cat /etc/issue`>

=item * Perl Version C<`perl -v`>

Although Github Issues is strongly preferred, the RPerl development team also supports the legacy CPAN ticket system:

L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=RPerl>

=head2 Section 1.21: How Can I Write A Program Using RPerl?

Computer programs are written in a human-readable format called I<"source code">.  Source code is stored as plain text data inside normal computer files.  These are the same kind of text files which you may be already familiar with as ending in the F<.txt> file suffix.  The only difference is we simply choose a different file name suffix to identify these specific text files as containing source code.  Thus, programs written using the RPerl language are plain text files, which means you can use any text editor to create and modify your RPerl source code.  Examples of common text editors include Notepad, Pico, and Vi.

L<http://www.vim.org>

To avoid possible file format problems, do not edit your RPerl programs using a word processor such as Wordpad, Word, OpenOffice, or LibreOffice.

Experienced RPerl developers may choose to utilize an I<"integrated development environment"> (IDE), which is a special text editor made for writing software.  Examples of common Perl IDE applications include Eclipse EPIC, Padre, and Komodo (non-free).

=head2 Section 1.22: A Sample RPerl Program

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    
    # Foo Bar Arithmetic Example
    
    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;
    
    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils
    
    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]
    my integer $foo = 21 + 12;
    my integer $bar = 23 * 42 * 2;
    my number  $baz = to_number($bar) / $foo;
    print 'have $foo = ', to_string($foo), "\n";
    print 'have $bar = ', to_string($bar), "\n";
    print 'have $baz = ', to_string($baz), "\n";

=head2 Section 1.23: What Are The Parts Of That Sample RPerl Program?

This program is separated by blank lines into 4 sections: shebang, header, critics, and operations.  

Other than the shebang and critics, all lines beginning with C<#> are comments and can be safely ignored or discarded without affecting the program.

The I<"shebang"> section is required, always contains exactly 1 line, and is short for I<"hash bang">; referring to the two leading characters C<#!> of this line.  The I<"octothorpe"> character C<#> (tic-tac-toe symbol) is called a I<"pound-sign"> when used on a telephone, and is called a I<"hash"> (or more recently and less accurately I<"hash-tag">) when used on a computer.  The exclamation-point character C<!> is called a I<"bang"> when used on a computer.  When appearing together as the first two characters in a plain text file, the hash and bang characters tell the operating system to run the immediately-following command (in this case the Perl interpreter invoked by C</usr/bin/env perl>) and pass the remaining contents of the text file as input to the command.  (Traditionally, the Perl interpreter has been located at F</usr/bin/perl>, however we must practice prudence by asking the operating system environment where our Perl interpreter is actually located, in order to support those cases where Perl may be installed in a non-standard directory, such as with Perlbrew or manually-built Perl interpreters.  Please see L</Section 1.24: How Do I Run The RPerl Compiler?> for more information.)  In other words, if the first line of a plain text file is C<#!/usr/bin/env perl> (or C<#!/usr/bin/perl> or something similar), then that file is a Perl program.

The I<"header"> section is required and always contains 4 lines for an RPerl I<"program"> file ending in F<.pl>, or 5 lines for an RPerl I<"module"> ending in F<.pm> (covered later in Chapter 11).  C<use> is recognized by Perl as a special I<"keyword"> (also a Perl I<"function">) which has 2 primary purposes: to load additional RPerl modules, and to change RPerl settings called I<"pragma"> settings.  (Please see L</Section 4.6: C<use strict; use warnings;> Pragmas & Magic> for more information about I<"pragma"> system configuration modes.)  The C<use RPerl;> line is dual-purpose, it both loads the F<RPerl.pm> module and enables the special RPerl low-magic pragma.  (Please see L</Section 1.25.4: The Low-Magic Perl Commandments> for more information about low magic versus high magic.)  The C<use strict;> and C<use warnings;> lines enable basic Perl pragmas which require decent programming practices by the human programmers.  The C<our $VERSION = 0.001_000;> line sets the version number of this RPerl program.

The I<"critics"> section aids in the proper detection of errors in your RPerl source code.  This section of source code is only included as necessary, and may contain 1 or more lines beginning with C<## no critic>, which disable the errors caused by the over-restrictive nature of some Perl::Critic policies.  There are currently 6 critics commands enabled for normal RPerl users, the first 2 of which are given in this example.  The "USER DEFAULT 1" C<no critic> command allows the use of numeric values such as C<21> and C<12>, as well as the common C<print> command.  The C<USER DEFAULT 2> critics command allows the printing of C<'have $foo = '>, where a single-quoted C<'> string literal value contains the the dollar-sign C<$> sigil (covered later in Chapter 2).

The I<"operations"> section is required and contains 1 or more lines of general-purpose RPerl source code.  This is the main body of your program.  The 6 lines of source code in our example are used to perform some simple arithmetic and display the results.  The C<my integer $foo = 21 + 12;> line declares a new I<"variable"> named C<$foo>.  A variable is simply a place to store your individual pieces of data, identified by a name of your choice.  (Please see L</CHAPTER 2: SCALAR VALUES & VARIABLES (NUMBERS & TEXT)> for more information about variables.)  Every variable in RPerl must be defined as containing exactly one type of data, such as whole numbers or decimal numbers or characters or strings, etc.  (In normal Perl, there are no data types.)

The variable C<$foo> is defined as containing the data type I<"integer">, which is another word for whole numbers, such as C<0> or C<1> or C<-5_126>.  C<$foo> is initialized to contain the arithmetic result of numeric literal values C<21> plus C<12>.

The C<my integer $bar = 23 * 42 * 2;> line does much the same thing, creating a new numeric variable named C<$bar> and initialized with C<23> times C<42> times C<2>.

The C<my number $baz = to_number($bar) / $foo;> line creates a new variable named C<$baz>.  This variable contains floating-point numeric data, which is simply another term for decimal numbers such as C<0.1> or C<1.0> or C<-5_126.34>.  The variable C<$baz> is initialized to contain the quotient of the C<$bar> and C<$foo> variables.  The C<to_number()> RPerl type conversion I<"subroutine"> converts a non-floating-point C<integer> value to a floating-point C<number> value.  (A subroutine is a user-defined operation, in this case pre-defined by the RPerl development team for your convenience; please see L</CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZING BY SUBROUTINES> for more information.)

The C<print 'have $foo = ', $foo, "\n";> and following 2 lines will display on screen (not send to paper printer) the labeled values of C<$foo>, C<$bar>, and C<$baz> respectively.  The C<,> comma is used to separate multiple I<"arguments"> passed to the C<print> operator.  An I<"argument"> is simply a piece of data provided as input to an operation.  For example, the number C<23> and the variable C<$foo> are arguments to the addition operation in the source code C<23 + $foo>.  In the context of source code operations, the terms I<"operand"> and I<"parameter"> mean the same thing as I<"argument">.  (Please see L</Section 1.24: How Do I Run The RPerl Compiler?> for the similar-yet-different definition of I<"argument"> in the context of command-line programs.)

The C<to_string()> RPerl type conversion subroutine converts the numeric values to underscore-formatted string values, suitable for use via the C<print> operator.  If the C<to_string()> subroutine is not used, then the displayed numeric values will still be human-readable, but will not contain the proper underscores to be accepted back into RPerl as valid numeric data.  The "n" in the C<"\n"> double-quoted strings stands for "newline", which places the next piece of printed data down on the following line.

=head2 Section 1.24: How Do I Run The RPerl Compiler?

Normal Perl source code is executed using a software mechanism known as I<"interpretation">, which is to say that Perl is an I<"interpreted"> language and the F</usr/bin/perl> command is called the I<"Perl interpreter">.  The primary alternative to interpretation is I<"compilation">.  An interpreted computer program is converted from human-readable source code into computer-readable binary code one line at a time, and each line of code is executed before the following line is converted.  On the other hand, a compiled computer program is converted from source code into binary code all at once, then the resulting executable binary file can be run as many times as you like without further conversion.  So, RPerl is a I<"compiled"> subset of the Perl language and the F</usr/bin/rperl> command is called the I<"RPerl compiler">.

Like the Perl interpreter, the RPerl compiler accepts 2 different source code file types as input: Perl programs which end in F<.pl> and Perl modules which end in F<.pm>.  Perl program files actually run and execute actions, optionally receiving some functionality from 1 or more Perl module files if specified.  Perl modules do not run or execute actions themselves, they only provide functionality which must in turn be called from a Perl program, or from another Perl module which eventually gets called by a Perl program.

When you run the RPerl compiler program via the F</usr/bin/rperl> command, you may optionally provide input arguments which specify the many possible configuration settings to be used by RPerl while it is running.  Similarly, you may provide input arguments to most other command-line programs, such as Perl via the F</usr/bin/perl> command, etc.  In the context of command-line programs, the terms I<"command-line option"> and I<"argument"> and I<"command-line argument"> mean the same thing as I<"option">.  (Please see L</Section 1.23: What Are The Parts Of That Sample RPerl Program?> for the similar-yet-different definition of I<"argument"> in the context of source code operations.)

A list of all valid RPerl compiler options may be seen by issuing the following command:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -?

=for rperl X</noncode>

You may find the same information by viewing the following links:

L<rperl>

L<https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/RPerl/script/rperl>

To compile-then-execute the preceding RPerl example program, you may copy and paste the entire program (from shebang to second C<print>) into a temporary file such as F</tmp/foobar.pl>, then execute the following command:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl /tmp/foobar.pl

=for rperl X</noncode>

The output of this example program should be:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $foo = 33
    have $bar = 1_932
    have $baz = 58.545_454_545_454_5

=for rperl X</noncode>

If the compilation is successful, a new compiled executable file will be created in F</tmp/foobar>.  You may then directly execute the compiled program as many times as you like, without needing to recompile it using the C<`rperl`> command, and you should receive the exact same output as the non-compiled code:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ /tmp/foobar
    have $foo = 33
    have $bar = 1_932
    have $baz = 58.545_454_545_454_5

=for rperl X</noncode>

Please see L</CHAPTER 11: CLASSES, PACKAGES, MODULES, LIBRARIES> for more information about compiling Perl modules.

These areas of interest are reflected in the tone and intention of RPerl.

=head3 Section 1.25.2: History Of RPerl

The RPerl project officially began as a New Year's Resolution on January 1st, 2013.  Following the grand tradition of Perl creator I<"Saint" Larry Wall>, RPerl version releases are often timed to coincide with major holidays.

After 1 year of work, RPerl v1.0beta1 was released on New Year's Day 2014, eventually followed by RPerl v1.0beta2 on Christmas 2014.

The much-anticipated RPerl v1.0 full release was made on US Independence Day 2015, and RPerl v1.2 came on Halloween 2015.

RPerl v1.3 was released on Thanksgiving 2015, followed by RPerl v1.4 on Christmas 2015, and so forth.

RPerl v1.0 was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, then RPerl v1.2 and v1.3 were funded through a second Kickstarter campaign.  Work on the first 6 chapters of this book was funded, in part, by grants from The Perl Foundation.

RPerl v2.0 was released on US Independence Day 2016, exactly 1 year after v1.0 was released, in order to establish a regular annual release cycle.

=head3 Section 1.25.3: Performance Of RPerl

The question of I<"How fast is RPerl?"> does not have one simple answer; instead there are several factors and configuration modes to be taken into consideration.  A relatively detailed description of the performance and modes may be found at the following link:

L<http://rperl.org/performance_benchmarks.html>

The most condensed answer is that I<"RPerl is really fast.">  Utilizing RPerl's fastest execution modes, we see performance very close to the highly-optimized I<C++> programming language, which means RPerl is now among the short list of "world's fastest languages" along with C, C++, and Fortran.

=head3 Section 1.25.4: The Low-Magic Perl Commandments

The high-magic features of Perl are primarily responsible for the slow speed at which Perl executes general-purpose computations.  The I<"R"> in RPerl stands for I<"Restricted">, in that we restrict ourselves to only use the low-magic features of Perl which can run really fast.

The definitive list of do's and do-not's for high-magic vs low-magic Perl programming is called I<The Low Magic Perl Commandments> (LMPC).  There are 64 total commandments split into 5 groups of Ideals, Magic, Data, Operations, and Object-Orientation.  The "Thou Shalt" commandments appear in the left column, and the "Thou Shalt Nots" appear on the right.

L<http://rperl.org/the_low_magic_perl_commandments.html>

=head3 Section 1.25.6: Fun With Proverbs & Catch Phrases & Acronyms

St. Larry has given us short and powerful proverbs, some of which are meant to have a purposefully tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic interpretation.

Will has provided a corollary to each of St. Larry's official proverbs.

=head2 Section 1.26: What's New In RPerl v2.0?

The single most significant new feature included in RPerl v2.0 is automatic parallelization.  This long-awaited software feature was promised from the very beginning of RPerl's initial development, with RPerl v2.0 being the originally-designated target for release of auto-parallel capabilities.  We stuck to the plan and delivered on time: the 4th of July, 2016.

Automatic parallelization is now enabled on 4 parallel CPU cores by default, because quad-core CPUs are common at this time.  You may utilize the C<--num_cores=8> command-line argument to double the default number of parallel cores, for example.  (Please see L</B.18: Modes, Parallelize> and L</B.19: Modes, Parallelize, Number Of Cores> for more information about auto-parallelization arguments.)

Currently, shared memory parallel hardware platforms are supported, such as multi-core CPUs and supercomputers, by utilizing the L<OpenMP|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP> parallelization software.  In the near future we will add support for distributed memory platforms, such as clusters and the cloud, by utilizing the L<MPI|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface> parallelization software, as well as GPUs and other specialty hardware by utilizing the L<OpenCL|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL> parallelization software. 

RPerl triggers auto-parallelization by simply including the word 'PARALLEL' in a loop label; everything inside that loop will be automatically parallelized, including multiply-nested loops.  RPerl implements the L<polytope model|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope_model> (AKA L<polyhedral model|http://polyhedral.info>) for loop parallelization, by utilizing the L<Pluto PolyCC|http://pluto-compiler.sourceforge.net> polytope software.

In addition to auto-parallelization, a number of other new features were released after RPerl v1.0 and by-or-before v2.0, including but not limited to:

=head2 Section 1.27: Exercises

=head3 1.  Hello World  [ 15 mins ]

On a computer with RPerl already installed, create a directory named F<LearningRPerl> containing a sub-directory named F<Chapter1>.  Using the B<I<Foo Bar>> example program as a template, manually type a new RPerl program into a file named F<exercise_1-hello_world.pl> inside the F<LearningRPerl/Chapter1> sub-directory.  The sole purpose of your first program is to use the C<print> operator and simply display the following one line of text output, followed by one newline character:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World!

=for rperl X</noncode>

Run your new program by issuing the following command at your terminal command prompt:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter1/exercise_1-hello_world.pl

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<HINT: You only need the "USER DEFAULT 1" C<no critic> command, so your resulting program should be 7 lines long, not counting comments or blank lines.>

=head3 2.  RPerl Commands  [ 15 mins ]

First, run the following RPerl command, and observe the output for use in 2a and 2b below:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -?

=for rperl X</noncode>

2a.  What are some RPerl command-line options with which you are already familiar?

2b.  With which options are you unfamiliar?

Next, run the following 3 RPerl commands, for 2c and 2d below:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t -V LearningRPerl/Chapter1/exercise_1-hello_world.pl
    $ rperl -t -D LearningRPerl/Chapter1/exercise_1-hello_world.pl
    $ rperl -t -V -D LearningRPerl/Chapter1/exercise_1-hello_world.pl

=for rperl X</noncode>

2c.  How do the outputs of these 3 commands differ from the output of Exercise 1?

2d.  How do the outputs differ from one another?

=head3 3.  Foo Bar Arithmetic  [ 15 mins ]

Manually type the entire B<I<Foo Bar Arithmetic>> example program into a file named F<exercise_3-foo_bar_arithmetic.pl> inside the F<LearningPerl/Chapter1> sub-directory.  (Even if you have already used copy-and-paste on the B<I<Foo Bar Arithmetic>> example program, you should still use this as an opportunity to build some RPerl muscle memory and type it in by hand.)

Modify your program by adding a new floating-point numeric variable named C<$zab>, set its value to C<$foo> divided by C<$bar> (don't forget C<to_number()>), change the starting value of C<$bar>, and use C<print> to generate the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $foo = 33
    have $bar = 966
    have $baz = 29.272_727_272_727_3
    have $zab = 0.034_161_490_683_229_8

=for rperl X</noncode>

Run your program thusly:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter1/exercise_3-foo_bar_arithmetic.pl

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head1 CHAPTER 2: SCALAR VALUES & VARIABLES (NUMBERS & TEXT)

Most programming languages include the basic principle of using named I<"variables"> to store data values such as numbers, text strings, and lists of multiple numbers or strings.  As stated in L</Section 1.23: What Are The Parts Of That Sample RPerl Program?> above, a "variable is simply a place to store your individual pieces of data, identified by a name of your choice".  The term I<"variable"> is a reference to the fact that the value stored inside a variable may I<"vary"> according to the needs of the programmer.  If a stored value will never change, then you should use a I<"constant"> instead of a variable.  (Please see section L</Section 2.5: Constant Data> for more information about constants.)

Multiple variables may be created in a computer program, each with a different name such as C<$foo> or C<$bar> or C<$baz>, and each potentially containing a different value.  You can choose whatever name you want for each variable you create, such as the following three variables:

    my integer $some_whole_number   = 23;
    my number  $some_decimal_number = 21.12;
    my string  $some_funny_word     = 'howdy';

A single piece of data, such as one number or one string, is called a I<"scalar">.  Multiple pieces of data combined into a single aggregate structure may be either an I<"array"> or a I<"hash">, described in chapters 3 and 6, respectively.  (Although sharing the same terminology, the I<hash> data structure is not related to the I<hash> C<#> tic-tac-toe character.)  In normal Perl, only scalar variable names begin with the dollar-sign C<$> I<"sigil">, while aggregate data structures are stored in variables starting with different sigils like at-sign C<@> or percent-sign C<%>.  A sigil is simply a special character prefixed to a word, in order to help us quickly identify different source code components.  In RPerl, all variable names begin the C<$> sigil, both scalar types and aggregate structures alike.

=for comment DEV NOTE, CORRELATION #rp400: all POD changes must be made in both RPerl.pm & RPerl/Learning.pm

RPerl provides 7 scalar data types:

=over

=item * C<boolean>

=item * C<unsigned_integer>

=item * C<integer> (core)

=item * C<gmp_integer>

=item * C<number> (core)

=item * C<character>

=item * C<string> (core)

=back

Of the 7 RPerl scalar data types, 3 are directly (natively) supported by the Perl 5 core: C<integer>, C<number>, and C<string>.  This means the Perl 5 core is capable of directly identifying and storing those 3 core types.  The remaining 4 non-core types are indirectly supported by the Perl 5 interpreter: C<boolean> and C<unsigned_integer> can be stored within either an C<integer> or C<number>; C<character> can be stored within a C<string>; and C<gmp_integer> is supported by the C<use bigint;> wrapper around the C<Math::BigInt::GMP> module.

When RPerl application source code is compiled from RPerl into C++, all 7 data types are natively supported by C++ for high-speed execution.

A single group of actual numeric digit(s) or quoted string character(s) is called a I<"literal">, such as:

    -21         # integer or gmp_integer or number

    'howdy'     # string

    -23.421_12  # number

    1_234_567   # unsigned_integer or integer or gmp_integer or number

    1_234_567_890_123_456_789_012_345_678_901_234_567_890_123_456_789_012_345  # gmp_integer

    'One million, two-hundred-thirty-four thousand, five-hundred-sixty-seven'  # string

    '1'         # character or string

    'a'         # character or string

    "\n"        # newline character or string

    q{}         # empty character or string

    0           # boolean or unsigned_integer or integer or gmp_integer or number

=head2 Section 2.1: Numeric Data & Operators

RPerl provides 5 numeric data types:

=over

=item * C<boolean>

S< >S< >S< >S< >a boolean logic value, either 0 or 1

=item * C<unsigned_integer>

S< >S< >S< >S< >a positive whole number value, greater-than or equal to 0

=item * C<integer>

S< >S< >S< >S< >a whole number value, either negative, 0, or positive

=item * C<gmp_integer>

S< >S< >S< >S< >a possibly-very-large whole number value, either negative, 0, or positive; may safely exceed your computer's data type limits

=item * C<number>

S< >S< >S< >S< >a floating-point decimal number value, either negative, 0, or positive

=back

Perl 5 provides several I<"built-in operators"> designed for use with numeric data, which can be organized into 6 general categories:

=over

=item * Arithmetic

=item * Trigonometry

=item * Comparison (Relational & Equality)

=item * Logic

=item * Bitwise

=item * Miscellaneous

=back

Most of the operators which have names consisting of normal letters (a - z) are classified as I<"functions"> in Perl 5 terminology.  Notable exceptions are the logic operators, which are simply classified as "operators" in Perl, along with most of the operators which have names consisting of special characters.  For the sake of simplicity, we will only use the term "operator" throughout this textbook.

L<http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html>

L<http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html>

Each operator in Perl 5 (and thus RPerl) is assigned 4 important characteristics: I<"arity"> (a number), I<"fixity"> (a placement location), I<"precedence"> (a number) and I<"associativity"> (a chirality or "handedness").  Operators of unary arity accept exactly 1 input operand, binary operators accept exactly 2 operands, etc.  Prefix operators appear before their respective operands, postfix appear after, infix appear between, and closed operators appear both before and after their operands.  Operators with a lower numeric precedence are executed before operators with a higher precedence; in the absence of parentheses, multiplication executes before addition because multiplication has a lower precedence number.  Operators with equal precedence number are grouped by (and executed in order of) associativity; in the absence of parentheses, multiple subtraction operators will execute from left to right because subtraction is left-associative, whereas multiple exponent operators will execute from right to left because exponentiation is right-associative.  For more information, see the Appendix:

L</D.3: Syntax Arity, Fixity, Precedence, Associativity>

Beyond the built-in math operators in Perl 5, more advanced operators and functions are available via the MathPerl software suite, which is (perhaps unsurprisingly) optimized using the RPerl compiler.

L<MathPerl on CPAN|https://metacpan.org/release/MathPerl>

=head3 Section 2.1.1: Boolean Literals

The most memory-efficient numeric literal is C<boolean>, which represents a single I<"bit"> (binary digit) of information.  A C<boolean> literal may only give the values of exactly 0 or 1.

    0     # boolean
    1     # boolean
    -1    # not a boolean
    1.5   # not a boolean
    -1.5  # not a boolean

=head3 Section 2.1.2: Unsigned Integer Literals

The second most efficient numeric literal is C<unsigned_integer>, which represents a single whole (non-decimal) number greater-than or equal to 0.  An C<unsigned_integer> literal may describe any positive whole number, within the data size limits of the data types supported by your operating system software and computer hardware.  An C<unsigned_integer> may not describe a negative number or a non-whole number.

    23      # unsigned_integer
    0       # unsigned_integer
    42_230  # unsigned_integer
    -23     # not an unsigned_integer
    42.1    # not an unsigned_integer
    999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999  # bad unsigned_integer, outside data type limits

=head3 Section 2.1.3: Integer Literals

The third most efficient numeric literal is C<integer>, which represents a single whole (non-decimal) number.  An C<integer> literal may describe any positive or negative whole number, within your operating system and hardware data type limits.

    -23     # integer
    0       # integer
    42_230  # integer
    42.1    # not an integer
    -999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999  # bad integer, outside data type limits

=head3 Section 2.1.4: GMP Integer Literals

The GNU Multi-Precision (GMP) software library is utilized to provide the C<gmp_integer> numeric literal, representing a single whole (non-decimal) number which may safely exceed the data type limits of your operating system and hardware.  A C<gmp_integer> literal may describe any positive or negative whole number, within the limits of the memory (real or virtual) available to your RPerl code.

    -23     # gmp_integer
    0       # gmp_integer
    42_230  # gmp_integer
    42.1    # not a gmp_integer
    -999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999  # gmp_integer

=head3 Section 2.1.5: Number Literals

The C<number> numeric literal represents a single floating-point (decimal) number, and may express any real number within your computer's data type limits.

    -23.42     # number
    0.000_001  # number
    42.23      # number
    42         # number
    -4_123.456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456  # bad number, outside data type limits

=head3 Section 2.1.6: Underscore Digit Separators

For C<unsigned_integer>, C<integer>, C<gmp_integer>, and C<number> literals, an I<"underscore"> C<_> character must be inserted after every third digit away from the decimal point, where the underscore is used in a similar manner as a comma when writing long numbers by hand.

    1_234_567  # integer, same as "1,234,567" in American notation
    -32_123    # integer, same as "-32,123" in American notation
    -32123     # bad integer, missing underscore

    1.234_567           # number, same as "1.234567" in American notation
    -32_123.456_789_01  # number, same as "-32,123.45678901" in American notation
    -32_123.456_78901   # bad number, missing underscore

=head3 Section 2.1.7: Optional Positive Sign

For C<unsigned_integer>, C<integer>, C<gmp_integer>, and C<number> literals, an optional C<+> plus sign may be prepended to explicitly indicate a numeric literal is positive (greater-than zero).

    1   # positive one
    +1  # also positive one

=head3 Section 2.1.8: Scientific Notation

For C<unsigned_integer>, C<integer>, and C<number> literals, very large or very small numbers may be approximated using I<"scientific notation">, where each number is normalized to have exactly one digit to the left of the decimal point, then a lower-case C<e> character and an appropriate integer power-of-ten is appended to the resulting normalized floating-point number.  The C<e> character stands for "exponent", as in "exponent of ten", and the Perl style of scientific notation is sometimes more accurately referred to as I<"scientific e notation">.

As with normal integers, negative exponents must be prefixed with a C<-> minus sign and positive exponents may be optionally prefixed with a C<+> plus sign.

=head3 Section 2.1.9: Truth Values

In the most simple case, a I<"truth value"> may be represented by a boolean literal where the numeric value of C<0> represents the truth value of I<"false">, and numeric C<1> represents I<"true">.  In general, a truth value is any data which may be recognized by Perl (and thus RPerl) as being either true or false; there is no third option.

Perl recognizes relatively few values as false, of which only 4 are accepted by RPerl:

      0   # false, number zero
     '0'  # false, text   zero
    q{0}  # false, text   zero
    q{}   # false, text   empty

All other values which RPerl accepts are recognized to hold a truth value of true.

All numeric operators in the comparison and logic sub-categories, as well as all string operators in the comparison sub-category, will generate truth values as output.

Perl attaches magic to the truth value of false, allowing it be utilized as either a normal truth value, or a numeric value of C<0>, or an empty string value of C<q{}>.  This magic behavior is not supported by C++, and thus not supported by RPerl.

In C and C++, only numeric C<0> is universally recognized as false, while the text 0 and empty text are recognized as true, which is different than Perl.  To achieve compatibility, RPerl automatically inserts additional C++ logic in all compiled output code to check for the 2 remaining RPerl false values of text character zero C<'0'> or C<q{0}>, and empty text C<q{}>.  This ensures the compiled C++ output code will behave identically to the original RPerl input source code, with regard to truth values.

B<WARNING FOR ALL COMPARISON & LOGIC OPERATORS:>

B<Due to Perl's magic attached to truth values of false, as well as the difference between Perl and C++ recognized truth values, you may experience unexpected or undefined behavior if a truth value is utilized anywhere except true-or-false conditions in loops and conditional statements.>

B<Only utilize the truth values returned by comparison and logic operators within the condition enclosed by parentheses in C<if ()>, C<elsif ()>, C<for ()>, or C<while ()>.>

    if    (1 > 2)     { print 'I think not', "\n"; }  # good use of greater-than operator
    elsif ($x and $y) { print 'Maybe',       "\n"; }  # good use of          and operator

    for   (my integer $i = 0; $i < 23; $i++) { print 'finite loop',   "\n"; }  # good use of less-than operator
    while (                    1 != 2      ) { print 'infinite loop', "\n"; }  # good use of not-equal operator

    my integer $foo = 3 + (1 >= 2);   # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of greater-than-or-equal operator
    my integer $bar = 3 * (1 <= 2);   # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of    less-than-or-equal operator
    my integer $bat = sin (1 == 2);   # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of                 equal operator

=head3 Section 2.1.10: Floating-Point Error

A I<"floating-point number"> is any number which includes a decimal point C<.> as part of the numeric representation, as opposed to an integer which does not include a decimal point.  In RPerl, all floating-point values are stored in variables of the data type C<number>.

       0  # integer
       1  # integer
    -123  # integer
    
       0.1    # floating-point
       1.654  # floating-point
    -123.4    # floating-point
    
    my integer $some_int   = 23;     # integer variable
    my number  $some_float = 23.42;  # floating-point variable

All computer languages which perform calculations on floating-point numbers are susceptible to I<"floating-point error">, which is any inaccuracy due to incorrect rounding or lack of available precision.

For example, suppose you have a floating-point number C<0.105>, which seems normal enough.  Let us further suppose you want to divide C<0.105> by some other number, say C<1_000>, and by the simple rules of arithmetic you would expect to arrive at an answer of C<0.000_105>.  Unfortunately, due to the way floating-point numbers are stored in computer memory, the actual result is closer to C<0.000_104_999>, so C<0.000_105> happens to be one of many possible floating-point errors.

           (0.105 / 1_000) == 0.000_105    # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: false
    print ((0.105 / 1_000) -  0.000_105);  # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: -1.355_252_715_606_88e-20

It will usually not be possible to easily predict when and where floating-point error will occur.  In general, you may experience the effects of floating-point error whenever your code relies upon one or more of the following:

=over

=item * A floating-point operator which must return a specific, exact result

=item * A floating-point variable which must contain a specific, exact value

=item * A floating-point value which must exactly equal another floating-point value

=back

To compensate for unpredictable floating-point error, you should use the I<"floating-point epsilon"> value stored in the constant C<RPerl::EPSILON()>, which is a very small number used to help detect inaccuracies.  Whenever you want of directly compare two floating-point values, instead use the subtraction C<-> and absolute value C<abs> operators to take the positive difference, then use the less-than C<E<lt>> operator to compare the difference to the floating-point epsilon value.  If the difference is less-than the floating-point epsilon, then the two input floating-point values can be considered to be numerically equal.

                                         RPerl::EPSILON()  # A VERY SMALL NUMBER: 0.000_000_000_000_000_2
         (0.105 / 1_000) == 0.000_105                      # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: false
    abs ((0.105 / 1_000) -  0.000_105) < RPerl::EPSILON()  #   EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: true

X<break_code_blocks>


    my number $foo = 0.105 / 1_000;
    my number $faa = 0.105 / 1_000;
    my number $bar = 0.000_105;
    my number $bat = 0.000_105;
         if (0.000_105 == 0.000_105)             { print 'true'; } else { print 'false'; }  #   EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: true
         if ((0.105 / 1_000) == (0.105 / 1_000)) { print 'true'; } else { print 'false'; }  #   EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: true
         if ($bar == $bat)                       { print 'true'; } else { print 'false'; }  #   EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: true
         if ($foo == $faa)                       { print 'true'; } else { print 'false'; }  #   EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: true
         if ($foo == $bar)                       { print 'true'; } else { print 'false'; }  # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: false
    if (abs ($foo -  $bar) < RPerl::EPSILON())   { print 'true'; } else { print 'false'; }  #   EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: true

B<WARNING FOR ALL FLOATING-POINT NUMERIC OPERATORS:>

B<Due to floating-point error, unexpected behavior may be experienced if a floating-point value is tested for exact equality with any other value.>

B<Always use the floating-point epsilon value C<RPerl::EPSILON()> to check for approximate equality instead of exact equality.>

B<WARNING FOR ALL BITWISE OPERATORS:>

B<Due to the difference between how integer and non-integer scalar values are stored in memory, you may experience unexpected or undefined behavior if a bitwise operator is passed any non-integer operands as input.>

B<Only utilize bitwise operators with integer, unsigned_integer, or boolean operands.>

    ~(1)      # good use of bitwise negation    operator
    12 << 2   # good use of bitwise shift left  operator
    13 >> 3   # good use of bitwise shift right operator

    my unsigned_integer $foo = 14;
    $foo & 4  # good use of bitwise and operator
    $foo | 5  # good use of bitwise  or operator
    $foo ^ 6  # good use of bitwise xor operator

    my number $bar = 21.12;
    ~($bar)         # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of bitwise negation    operator
      $bar <<    7  # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of bitwise shift left  operator
         8 >> $bar  # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of bitwise shift right operator

    23.42 &   9   # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of bitwise and operator
    23    ^ 1.1   # UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: bad use of bitwise xor operator

B<Also, due to the difference between how signed and unsigned integer values are stored in memory, both Perl's C<use integer;> pragma configuration command as well as RPerl's C<integer> and C<unsigned_integer> data types must be utilized in correct combination, as described below.  Perl relies on the C<use integer;> pragma to determine numeric data types, while C++ relies on the actual data types provided by the software developers as part of each variable declaration.  You may experience unexpected behavior if a bitwise operator is utilized with mismatching pragma and data types.>

B<Each call to Perl's C<use integer;> pragma applies to 1 entire RPerl source code file at a time, either 1 full *.pl program file or 1 full *.pm module file.  If the C<use integer;> pragma is in effect for a specific RPerl file, then all bitwise operators in said file must be provided with input operands which are signed (positive or negative) integers only, not unsigned integers or floating-point numbers or other data types.  If C<use integer;> is not in effect for an RPerl file, then all bitwise operators in said file must be provided with operands which are unsigned (non-negative) integers or booleans only, not signed integers or other data types.>

B<The C<use integer;> pragma also affects the results of all arithmetic and comparison operators by discarding the non-integer (fractional) portion of input operands, as if the C<floor> operator were called to convert each floating-point number into an integer.  Because of this, floating-point operators and signed integer bitwise operators must not be included in the same single RPerl source code file; to compensate, simply move all signed bitwise operators into their own separate RPerl *.pm module file which calls C<use integer;>.>

B<Please see the Perl documentation for more information about the C<use integer;> pragma:>

RPerl provides 2 text data types:

=over

=item * C<character>

S< >S< >S< >S< >a single text character; either a letter, number, or special character

=item * C<string>

S< >S< >S< >S< >one or more text characters; any combination of letters, numbers, and special characters

=back

RPerl provides 3 delimiters for enclosing text data:

=over

=item * Single-Quotes

C<'I am a single-quoted string literal'>

=back

=over

=item * Double-Quotes

C<"I am a double-quoted string literal">

=back

Perl 5 provides several built-in operators designed for use with text data, which can be organized into 7 general categories:

=over

=item * Editing

=item * Case

=item * Comparison (Relational & Equality)

=item * Search

=item * Formatting

=head3 Section 2.2.1: Character Literals

The most memory-efficient text literal is C<character>, which represents exactly zero characters or one character of information.  A C<character> may express the value of any single numeric digit (0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9); letter (a, b, c, ..., y, z, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z ); or special ASCII character (!, #, *, +, etc).  If the C<character> literal has length zero, meaning it represents zero characters of information, then it is called the I<"empty character"> and contains no data.

    ''           # INVALID: use q{} for empty character
    '0'          #   VALID
    'h'          #   VALID
    '+'          #   VALID
    '\n'         # INVALID: too many characters, use "\n" for newline character
    '-1'         # INVALID: too many characters
    'howdy23!'   # INVALID: too many characters

    ""           # INVALID: use q{} for empty character
    "0"          #   VALID
    "h"          #   VALID
    "+"          #   VALID
    "\n"         #   VALID: newline
    "-1"         # INVALID: too many characters & invalid use of double-quotes
    "howdy23!"   # INVALID: too many characters & invalid use of double-quotes

    q{}          #   VALID: empty
    q{0}         #   VALID
    q{h}         #   VALID
    q{+}         #   VALID
    q{\n}        # INVALID: too many characters, use "\n" for newline character
    q{-1}        # INVALID: too many characters
    q{howdy23!}  # INVALID: too many characters

=head3 Section 2.2.2: String Literals

Any text data more than 1 character in length must be represented by a C<string> literal, which is comprised of any combination of valid C<character> literal characters (numeric digits, letters, and special ASCII characters).  Like the empty character, if a C<string> literal has length zero then it is called the I<"empty string"> and contains no data.

    ''           # INVALID: use q{} for empty string
    '0'          #   VALID
    'h'          #   VALID
    '+'          #   VALID
    '\n'         # INVALID: not a newline, use "\n" for string containing newline
    '\\n'        #   VALID: interpolated to become two characters (backslash, letter n)
    '-1'         #   VALID
    'howdy23!'   #   VALID

    ""           # INVALID: use q{} for empty string
    "0"          # INVALID: invalid use of double-quotes, must contain newline or tab character(s)
    "h"          # INVALID: invalid use of double-quotes, must contain newline or tab character(s)
    "+"          # INVALID: invalid use of double-quotes, must contain newline or tab character(s)
    "\n"         #   VALID: interpolated to become newline character
    "-1"         # INVALID: invalid use of double-quotes, must contain newline or tab character(s)
    "howdy23!"   # INVALID: invalid use of double-quotes, must contain newline or tab character(s)

    q{}          #   VALID: empty string
    q{0}         #   VALID
    q{h}         #   VALID
    q{+}         #   VALID
    q{\n}        # INVALID: not a newline, use "\n" for string containing newline
    q{\\n}       #   VALID: interpolated to become two characters (backslash, letter n)
    q{-1}        #   VALID
    q{howdy23!}  #   VALID

=head3 Section 2.2.3: Single-Quotes

Text literals enclosed in single-quotes are the simplest and most common case in RPerl.

Single-quoted text literals are not I<"interpolated">, which means the literal's data contents are not changed by Perl or RPerl in any way, except for the extra-special double-backslash C<\\> as described below.  Because single-quotes do not activate string interpolation, you can not use a single-quoted string literal to represent special characters such as newline or tab.

Do not use single-quotes to represent a newline or tab character, use double-quotes C<"\n"> or C<"\t"> instead.

Do not use single-quotes to represent an empty character or empty string, use q-quotes C<q{}> instead.

In normal Perl, single-backslash characters C<\> are used to create special characters called I<"escape sequences">, the most common of which are the well-known newline C<\n> and tab C<\t> escape sequences.  Each valid escape sequence actually counts as only one character of computer data, even though it is represented to humans by 2 or more typed characters, so a single escape sequence may be utilized as either a C<character> text literal or a C<string> text literal.  (Thus, C<"\n"> and C<"\t"> may both be utilized as either a C<character> or C<string> in RPerl, but only when using double-quotes as discussed in the following section.)

In single-quoted string literals, the only escape sequence supported by RPerl is the double-backslash C<\\>, so the string literal C<'\\'> is interpolated to mean only one single-backslash character C<\>.  To represent two backslash characters C<\\>, utilize two double-backslash escape sequences in a row C<'\\\\'>; for three backslashes C<\\\> utilize three escape sequences C<'\\\\\\'>, and so forth.

Because RPerl only accepts double-backslashes (not single-backslashes) within single-quotes, RPerl thus does not accept any odd number of consecutive backslash characters within single-quotes.  For example, two or four backslashes in a row are supported, but one or three or five directly adjacent backslashes are not supported.

In normal Perl, the backslash single-quote C<\'> escape sequence may be used to include a single-quote character C<'> within a single-quoted text literal.  As stated above, RPerl only supports the double-backslash C<\\> escape sequence within single-quotes, so the backslash single-quote C<\'> escape sequence is thus not supported.  Use double-quotes C<"'"> or q-quotes C<q{'}> to represent a single-quote C<'> character in an RPerl string literal.

Single-quoted text literals must B<not> contain:

=over

=item * Single-Quote Character: C<'>

=item * Odd Number Of Consecutive Backslash Characters: C<\\\> C<\\\\\> C<\\\\\\\>

=head3 Section 2.2.4: Double-Quotes

Text literals enclosed in double-quotes are fully interpolated in normal Perl, and are only used for trivial interpolation of strings containing the newline C<"\n"> or tab C<"\t"> escape sequences in RPerl.  All double-quoted strings in RPerl must contain at least one newline or tab special character.

In addition to escape sequences, string interpolation in normal Perl is also triggered by finding either the dollar-sign C<$> or I<"at-sign"> C<@> characters inside of a double-quoted string literal.  Because RPerl does not support string interpolation, double-quoted string literals must not contain the C<$> or C<@> characters.

Double-quoted string literals must not contain any backslash characters, other than those used in newline C<\n> and tab C<\t> escape sequences, and thus can not represent a single-backslash character C<\>; use single-quotes C<'\\'> or q-quotes C<q{\\}> double-backslash escape sequences instead. 

As with single-quotes, in normal Perl the backslash double-quote C<\"> escape sequence may be used to include a double-quote character C<"> within a double-quoted text literal.  As stated above, RPerl only supports the newline C<\n> and tab C<\t> escape sequences within double-quotes, so the backslash double-quote C<\"> escape sequence is thus not supported.  Use single-quotes C<'"'> or q-quotes C<q{"}> to represent a double-quote C<"> character in an RPerl string literal.

=head3 Section 2.2.5: C<q> Quotes

Text literals enclosed in I<"q-quotes"> begin with lowercase letter q and left I<"curly-brace"> characters C<q{>, and end with the right curly-brace C<}> character.  You must use q-quotes to represent empty text C<q{}> literals, which contain no characters.  Curly braces are also known as I<"curly-brackets"> or just I<"braces"> for short.

Normal Perl supports q-quoted string literals using delimiters other than curly-braces, as well as I<"qq-quotes"> which provide string interpolation in the same way as double-quoted strings.  RPerl's existing string quoting mechanisms cover all non-interpolated use cases, so RPerl does not support the additional qq-quotes or non-curly-brace q-quotes, because TDNNTBMTOWTDI.

q-quoted literals behave exactly the same as single-quoted literals, other than the empty string C<q{}> and the difference in delimiters.

q-quoted text literals must B<not> contain:

=over

=item * Right-Curly-Brace Character: C<}>

=item * Single-Backslash Character: C<\>

=item * Odd Number Of Consecutive Backslash Characters: C<\\\> C<\\\\\> C<\\\\\\\>

    substr EXPR, OFFSET
    substr EXPR, OFFSET, LENGTH
    substr EXPR, OFFSET, LENGTH, REPLACEMENT

EXPR and REPLACEMENT are string values, OFFSET and LENGTH are integer values;

When called with 2 operands, return substring of first operand EXPR, beginning at second operand OFFSET character and ending at end of first operand;

When called with 3 operands, return substring of first operand EXPR, beginning at second operand OFFSET character and ending after third operand LENGTH characters;

When called with 4 operands, return substring of first operand EXPR, beginning at second operand OFFSET character and ending after third operand LENGTH characters, and also edit first operand by replacing original substring with fourth operand REPLACEMENT string;

In all variants, OFFSET begins at 0;

In all variants, if second operand OFFSET is negative then substring begins absolute value of LENGTH characters before end of first operand EXPR;

In 3-operand and 4-operand variants, if third operand LENGTH is negative then substring ends absolute value of LENGTH characters before end of first operand EXPR;

In 4-operand variant, return value is original substring before replacement occurs, thus you can retrieve a substring and replace it with one operation;

In 4-operand variant, length of substring in third operand LENGTH need not equal length of string in fourth operand REPLACEMENT, length of first operand EXPR will be automatically increased or decreased as needed

We will now take a break from numbers and strings and operators, in order to investigate the various stages of installing and running RPerl, as well as the most common issues you may encounter.

Like normal Perl, RPerl tries to generate helpful messages when something does not go as planned.

A I<"warning"> occurs when something unexpected happens, but RPerl can continue on without being forced to end prematurely.

An I<"error"> occurs when something unexpected happens, and RPerl must end immediately.

We will collectively refer to both warnings and errors as I<"problems">, and we will refer to both warning messages and error messages as I<"problem messages">.

There are 15 RPerl I<"phases">, most of which are (hopefully unsurprisingly) termed as I<"compile phases">.  An RPerl phase is simply a distinct category of work to be done by RPerl or some other related software, and a compile phase is a category of work specifically related to compiling RPerl application source code. 

All warnings and errors in RPerl fall within exactly 1 phase; technically, only those phases shown in B<bold> contain problem messages generated by RPerl itself:

=head3 Section 2.3.1: Install, Base Dependencies

The first step toward using RPerl is installing RPerl, and the first step of installing RPerl is making sure you have a working copy of the Perl interpreter and a C++ compiler, as well as a few other base dependencies such as libc, libperl, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, GMP, cURL, and AStyle.  

A I<"dependency"> is one piece of software which another piece of software requires for proper functionality.  One software component is thus said to I<"depend"> upon a second software component, without which the first component would not work correctly.  A I<"subdependency"> is a dependency of a dependency.  Each piece of software may require any number of dependencies, each of which may require any number of subdependencies, and so forth until all required software components have been loaded.  For the purposes of the discussions in this book, the term "dependency" will inclusively refer to all of a specific software component's dependencies, subdependencies, sub-subdependencies, etc.

A I<"base dependency"> is a software component required for RPerl to function, and is differentiated from a I<"CPAN dependency"> because base dependencies are installed manually or via the operating system package manager instead of via the CPAN Perl software network, as detailed in the next section.  If you have a modern operating system, you may already have most-or-all of these base dependencies either pre-installed or available for easy automatic install via pre-built packages; if not, you may need to manually install one or more of them.  For more information on this phase of installation, please see:

L</Section 1.16: How Can I Download & Install RPerl?>

Unique challenges may be posed by every different combination of operating system and hardware platform, because there are many different versions (and even variants) of each base dependency, with no way to predict your computer's behavior ahead of time.  Also, the RPerl development team has little-to-no interaction with the developers of the base dependencies, so it is impossible to provide useful documentation of the countless possible problem messages which you may encounter in this phase.

Some common types of problem messages may include:

=over

=item * No Pre-Built Installation Package Available For Specific Dependency

=item * Pre-Built Package(s) Cannot Be Installed

=item * Pre-Built Package(s) Installed But Not Functioning Properly

=item * Other Miscellaneous Operating System Error

=item * Other Miscellaneous Hardware Error

=back

If you encounter any problems during this step, please consult your operating system's documentation or see:

L</Section 1.18: How Can I Obtain Technical Support For RPerl?>

=head3 Section 2.3.2: Install, CPAN Dependencies

Perhaps the most complex part of installing RPerl is comprised of finding, building, testing, and installing all of the software needed for RPerl's dependencies (and subdependencies) via CPAN.  A I<"CPAN dependency"> is an RPerl dependency which is installed via the CPAN software network.  Future versions of RPerl will provide easier pre-built installation packages for popular operating systems, such as those used in the base dependencies phase, but for now all (sub)dependencies must be downloaded from CPAN and custom-built for your operating system.  Each individual piece of software downloaded from CPAN is called a I<"distribution">, so RPerl itself is a CPAN distribution, and each of RPerl's CPAN (sub)dependencies is also a CPAN distribution.

We have tried to minimize the number of dependencies upon which RPerl relies, but even 1 dependency can itself have dozens or hundreds of subdependencies.  RPerl is a relatively complex piece of software, with a moderate number of dependencies and (by association) a high number of subdependencies.  If there is an error with even 1 of the numerous (sub)dependencies, it will either cause the RPerl installation to immediately terminate, or the installation will attempt to proceed in a partially-broken state, which will likely result in further errors when the broken software components are automatically tested.

CPAN promotes the use of a minimum version requirement for each (sub)dependency, which means RPerl will not use out-of-date software from CPAN, thereby avoiding a large number of known errors.  However, there is much less emphasis on utilizing a maximum version requirement, so CPAN will always default to installing the latest public release of each (sub)dependency.  It is the responsibility of the author of each (sub)dependency to ensure all public releases are stable, secure, and bug-free across a wide range of operating systems and hardware platforms, which is a constantly moving target for each software developer because new operating systems and hardware platforms are released all the time.  This means the latest public release of any 1 specific CPAN distribution may remain stable for a long time, and then all-of-a-sudden it may become unstable when a new version of one of its own (sub)dependencies is released containing a bug or incompatibility.  This further means the latest public release of the RPerl distribution on CPAN may work fine on your computer, then stop working properly if you update either the base dependencies or the CPAN dependencies.

There are 2 primary front-end applications used to install dependencies from CPAN, namely the C<`cpan`> and C<`cpanm`> commands, each of which has its own style of problem messages.  In addition, there are unique problem messages which may be emitted by each individual CPAN distribution.  As with the base dependencies in the previous RPerl install phase, there are countless possible problem messages you may encounter in this phase, none of which would be generated by RPerl itself.

Common problem messages in this phase may include:

=over

I<SOLUTION: The C<`cpan`> command should come bundled with Perl itself, while C<`cpanm`> is part of the separate "cpanminus" software package.  In Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux operating systems, you can use the commands C<`sudo apt-get install perl`> or C<`sudo apt-get install cpanminus`> for installation.  In other operating systems, please refer to the applicable documentation or technical support.>

If an error is encountered while installing a non-RPerl distribution from CPAN, such as the fictitious "Some::Dependency" in our example, then you may still be able to use RPerl by forcing the dependency to install regardless of the error by C<`cpan -f -i Some::Dependency`> or C<`cpanm -f Some::Dependency`>.

You can test your network connection via the C<`cpan -p`> command, and you can see a list of the recommended mirror servers (which should hopefully not have issues) via the C<`cpan -P`> command.  Then, you can change your CPAN mirror servers by first running the interactive CPAN shell via the C<`perl -MCPAN -e shell`> command, then when you are presented with the C<cpanE<lt>> prompt, enter the C<o conf init> command to re-run configuration and select one of the recommended mirror servers you were shown by the previous C<`cpan -P`> command.>

Getting RPerl to work correctly does not simply require hitting a moving target, it requires hitting dozens of moving targets simultaneously.  Most of the authors of CPAN distributions are volunteers, and software bugs happen even when the developers are well-paid, so don't be surprised if you encounter a problem during this phase.  If you are convinced that you have found an as-yet undiscovered problem, please see:

L</Section 1.18: How Can I Obtain Technical Support For RPerl?>

and

L</Section 1.20: Are There Any Bugs In RPerl?>

The RPerl development team is in communication with the developers of several of the primary CPAN dependencies, so if you find a bug we may be able to help find the right people to fix it.

=head3 Section 2.3.3: Install, Test Suite

The final step of installing RPerl is to pass all tests in the RPerl automatic test suite, which can only occur after all base and CPAN dependencies are properly installed.  The RPerl test suite includes a few thousand individual test cases, covering all parts of the RPerl compiler.  If any of the RPerl tests fail or generate a problem message, then there may be a problem with RPerl itself, and we would very much appreciate your help by submitting a bug report:

=head3 Section 2.3.4: Initialize, Bootstrap Subcompile

Each time the RPerl compiler is called, it may utilize a number of its own internal I<"helper function"> components which are written using C++, so those components must first be compiled using a C++ compiler and linked to Perl 5 using Inline::CPP, during the I<"bootstrap subcompile"> phase. In common English usage, I<"bootstrap"> refers to "pull yourself up by your boot straps", which is the seemingly-impossible act of lifting one's self off the ground by pulling upward on one's shoes, and which means the ability to create something from nothing or to work some force upon one's own self.  In compiler terminology, bootstrap means a compiler which can partially or fully compile itself, and is used as a measure of a compiler's long-term progress because only the most mature compilers can bootstrap.  In this specific use of the term as part of the bootstrap subcompile phase, the term bootstrap means the need to use Inline::CPP to compile a small part of the RPerl compiler, which is then used to further compile other RPerl system and application code.

RPerl is a compiler, which itself utilizes 1 or more previously-existing compilers, the use of which we will call I<"subcompile"> actions.  The primary subcompile actions utilize the C++ compiler, because both "Initialize, Bootstrap Subcompile" and "Compile, Subcompile (Generate Binary)" are C++ subcompile phases.  Only RPerl system developers will be exposed to the additional non-C++ subcompile actions.

=head3 Section 2.3.6: Compile, Arguments & Files

RPerl is a compiler, so it is unsurprising that 9 of the 15 RPerl phases are compile phases.  When a software developer (like you!) runs the RPerl compiler via the C<`rperl`> command, the first compile phase checks the validity of the command-line arguments (AKA options) as well as the input source code file(s) to be compiled.  Command-line arguments can be entirely omitted, in which case default behavior will be utilized.  At least one input file must be specified, unless you are running C<`rperl -?`> or C<`rperl -v`> instead of a full RPerl compile command.

For details about all of RPerl's command-line arguments, please see Appendix B:

=head3 Section 2.3.7: Compile, Dependencies

Not to be confused with base dependencies in section 2.3.1 and CPAN dependencies in section 2.3.2, a normal RPerl I<"dependency"> is one piece of RPerl application software which another piece of RPerl application software requires for proper functionality.  Every RPerl application may have 0, 1, or any number of dependencies.  As in normal Perl, an RPerl dependency is specified in source code via the C<use Some::Dependency;> operator.

If your RPerl application has 1 or more dependencies, then RPerl must compile each dependency before it compiles your main RPerl application.  If any of the dependencies rely upon subdependencies (and so forth), then each subdependency must be recursively checked for its own dependencies and they must all be compiled as well.  In other words, before your main RPerl application can be compiled, RPerl must first compile all dependencies, subdependencies, etc.  If the compilation of dependencies is disabled via the C<--nodependencies> or C<--mode dependencies=OFF> command-line arguments, or if there is a problem encountered while attempting to compile one of the dependencies, then compilation of your main RPerl program will also almost certainly experience a problem or total failure.

During this phase of compilation, RPerl makes a list of all dependencies which need to be compiled; however, the actual compiling of each dependency's source code input file does not occur until the following compile phases.  This phase only produces an assessment of what files need to be compiled, and in what order.

Common problem messages in this phase may include:

=head3 Section 2.3.8: Compile, Parse Phase 0 (Check Perl Syntax)

This is the first phase where the input source code files are thoroughly checked for lexical and syntax errors.  The term I<"parse"> means to read through some structured data input such as human-readable plain-text source code, and a I<"full parse"> results in the computer storing some I<"intermediate representation"> (IR) which is a more computer-friendly encoding of the original source code.  All 3 parse phases are full parses, although only the final intermediate representation is utilized by RPerl.

The normal Perl interpreter is called in "check syntax only" mode with all I<"strictures"> enabled, as well as all warnings enabled and set to I<"fatal">, via the C<`perl -M"warnings FATAL=>q(all)" -Mstrict -cw`> command.  Strictures are additional built-in rules which normal Perl can optionally apply during parsing a source code input file, and a fatal warning is essentially upgraded to become the same thing as an error because execution will terminate instead of continuing.  All RPerl source code files are required to have strictures and (non-fatal) warnings enabled via the C<use strict; use warnings;> statements, but RPerl won't check for the inclusion of those statements until the following parse phase 1 (criticize Perl syntax); thus, we make sure both strictures and warnings are automatically enabled in this step, in order to catch normal Perl errors sooner rather than later.

All problems encountered in this step are triggered by normal Perl, not by RPerl itself, and it is impractical to attempt to embed all pertinent Perl documentation within this RPerl documentation.  Please utilize the following resources (in this order) to help reach a solution:

=for text This phase of compilation checks the input source code files to make sure they all follow Perl I<"best practices"> as originated in Damian Conway's book B<Perl Best Practices> and implemented in Jeffrey Thalhammer's software Perl::Critic.  A best practice is a rule or strategy which is commonly accepted by a professional community as being the most reliable and successful technique for approaching some specific task.

=for html <p>This phase of compilation checks the input source code files to make sure they all follow Perl <i>"best practices"</i> as originated in Damian Conway's book <u><b>Perl Best Practices</b></u> and implemented in Jeffrey Thalhammer's software Perl::Critic.  A best practice is a rule or strategy which is commonly accepted by a professional community as being the most reliable and successful technique for approaching some specific task.</p>

In this case, the professional community is our Perl computer programming community, and the Perl best practices themselves have been reduced to practice (get it?) by automatic source code checking via Perl::Critic and the PPI Perl pseudo-parser.  In this phase of parsing, Perl::Critic is configured to operate in the most restrictive mode possible, which is called severity level 1, AKA "brutal" mode, and enables all possible Perl::Critic "policies" (rules).  Although RPerl purposefully utilizes brutal mode, there are some Perl::Critic policies which either conflict with other policies (yes that's bad) or with RPerl itself.  To compensate for this, RPerl application developers must selectively disable each problematic policy one-at-a-time using C<## no critic> statements, which are explained throughout this book where applicable.  For a complete list of all accepted no-critic statements, please see Appendix C:

L</APPENDIX C: RPERL CRITICS>

In addition, RPerl-specific best practices are included throughout this book where explicitly indicated, although the RPerl best practices are not currently checked or enforced in any way, and you should be careful not to confuse Perl best practices with RPerl best practices.  It is assumed the RPerl application developers already have enough flaming hoops to jump through, in the form of the 3 existing RPerl parse phases, so RPerl best practices are not required, only suggested.

You may wish to purchase or download Damian Conway's book from our friends at O'Reilly Media, especially because its page numbers are referenced in this phase's error messages:

L<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001735.do>

If you can't afford to purchase the book at this time, then you can still review a free list including all of Mr. Conway's Perl best practices in Johan Vromans' reference guide, although currently we have not yet made a mapping from policy numbers to the corresponding book page numbers:

L<http://rperl.org/docs/PBP_refguide-1.02.00.pdf>

=head3 Section 2.3.10: Compile, Parse Phase 2 (Parse RPerl Syntax)

The final parse phase of compilation utilizes RPerl's actual grammar to check the input source code files for valid RPerl syntax.  The RPerl grammar implements a restricted subset of the normal Perl 5 language.  This phase follows naturally from the previous parse phases: RPerl syntax (parse phase 2) is more restrictive than Perl::Critic brutal severity (parse phase 1), which is in turn more restrictive than normal Perl with fatal warnings and strictures enabled (parse phase 0), which is again more restrictive than normal lax Perl (not needed for RPerl parsing).

Some error messages may also include a "Helpful Hint" indicating a possible cause or solution; computer language parsing can be a very complicated process and there is no guarantee the hint is correct, so each hint should be taken with a grain of salt (a dose of healthy skepticism).

=head3 Section 2.3.11: Compile, Generate (C++ Syntax)

After all parse phases of compilation have concluded, the original human-readable plain-text input source code files have been converted into an intermediate representation (IR) format known as an I<"abstract syntax tree"> (AST), which exists in the computer's random-access memory (RAM or just "memory"), and which is more easily analyzed or modified by a computer.

Plain-text source code formats can be readily understood by trained humans, but are nearly impossible for computers to directly understand; compilers like RPerl exist for the sole purpose of converting source code into format(s) more easily understood by a computer.  Intermediate representation formats such as RPerl's AST or normal Perl's I<"operation tree"> (AKA I<"optree">) or other languages' I<"bytecode"> can be understood by humans and computers alike, but with a significant amount of difficulty for both.  Binary code formats such as compiled executables or libraries can be readily understood by properly-configured computers, but are nearly impossible for humans to directly understand.

(The process of I<"decompiling"> or I<"reverse engineering"> the original human-readable source code from an optimized binary format is comparable to unscrambling an egg; it is currently considered nearly impossible to fully achieve, thus the act of compilation is considered to be one-way process and a strong protection against other people viewing your original source code or copying your intellectual property.  You should be careful not to confuse decompiling with uncompiling: decompiling accepts as input a compiled binary file and then produces as output human-readable source code, while uncompiling accepts as input human-readable source code and then takes the action of deleting all compiled binary files which were produced from the source code during previous compilations using the same file names.  Decompiling is not widely considered to be possible, while uncompiling is one of the more frequently utilized RPerl command-line arguments.)

During this phase of compilation, RPerl converts the AST format back into human-readable source code, but in the C++ language syntax (by default) instead of the RPerl language syntax.  This is called the I<"generate"> phase and is, in general, the exact opposite of a full parse phase; parsing converts from source code to IR, while generating converts from IR to source code.  When configured to operate in test mode, RPerl does not generate C++ source code during this phase, but instead generates back into the exact same RPerl source code as the original input file.  Test mode is thus able to check the generated RPerl source code to make sure it matches the original source code line-by-line, and also thereby "test" the RPerl parser's internal system code and "test" for the syntax correctness of the original source code, without the complexity of new C++ code becoming involved.

When compared to normal Perl, the 2 primary benefits of the RPerl compiler come from generating C++ source code: high-performance runtime speed optimization, and intellectual property source code protection.  The act of converting from one human-readable computer language source code into another is compared to the similar act of converting from one spoken (or written) human language to another; this is called the I<"translate"> process.  When computer language translation is utilized as part of a compiler, the software is called a I<"transpiler"> or "translating compiler".  RPerl is a transpiler.

During this phase, a number of changes and updates may be made to the output files.  Most of these changes were delayed from previous phases, due to as-yet-incomplete compile-time information.  This is the final phase during which RPerl directly generates output source code.

=head3 Section 2.3.13: Compile, Save Phase 1 (Format & Write Files To Disk)

This phase may utilize source code formatting software, including Perl::Tidy for Perl output code as well as the Artistic Style formatter for C++ output code.  If an error occurs with one of these third-party code formatters, please review the applicable documentation.

After the output files have been formatted, they are saved to your computer's storage, which usually means the output files are written to hard-disk or the equivalent.  Please be sure you have free disk space and the proper disk permissions to save files, etc.

=head3 Section 2.3.14: Compile, Subcompile (Generate Binary)

The final compile phase utilizes your pre-installed C++ compiler software, thus it is termed the subcompile phase.  Please be sure you have a subcompiler installed which supports the C++11 standard, such as GNU GCC v4.7 and Clang v3.3, among others.  If an error occurs during this phase, please refer to the applicable subcompiler documentation.

=head3 Section 2.3.15: Execute

If RPerl has been provided with exactly one file as input, and if that file is an executable Perl program file ending with C<.pl>, then RPerl may optionally execute the program after all previous phases have been completed.

If RPerl is utilized in test mode, then the original non-compiled Perl program input file will be executed via the Perl interpreter with RPerl extensions.  If RPerl is utilized in normal compile mode, then the compiled Perl program output file will be executed without the Perl interpreter.

=head2 Section 2.4: Variables With Scalar Values

An RPerl I<"expression"> is any general-purpose language component which either returns a value or is a literal value itself.

An RPerl I<"statement"> is any general-purpose language component which performs some action(s).

An RPerl I<"named operator"> is any of the 220+ Perl named operators, although RPerl only supports the low-magic forms of each operator.

An RPerl I<"operation"> is the equivalent of a single sentence in human language, and may be either an expression followed by a C<;> semicolon punctuation character, or a named operator followed by a semicolon, or a statement.

The equal-sign C<=> is the assignment operator, used to set the variable on its left to store the value of the expression on its right.

Perl's C<my> keyword is used to declare a new variable, and optionally initialize it to a starting value when combined with the C<=> assignment operator.

Normal Perl does not support specific data types, so in Perl one variable named C<$foo> may be initialized with a numeric value, then the same C<$foo> variable may be changed to hold a string value without any warning or error.

    my $foo = 23;
    $foo = 'twenty-three';  # just fine in normal Perl

On the other hand, RPerl I<requires> the use of data types for each and every variable.

    my $foo = 23;  # error in RPerl, all modes

    my number $foo = 23;
    $foo = 'twenty-three';  # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes, assigning string literal to number variable

    my number $foo = 23;
    $foo = 42;  # just fine in RPerl

Normal Perl provides a special literal value C<undef>, along with a built-in operator named C<defined> which can be used to test if a variable contains the special C<undef> value.  RPerl does not support the C<undef> value, nor use of the C<defined> operator with scalar variables, because C++ does not fully support the concept of undefined values, and RPerl's high-speed components are written using C++.

Future versions of RPerl will likely provide a flexible C<scalar> data type, which will offer the trade-off of higher memory usage in exchange for the ability to use one variable with multiple possible data types.  Currently, all RPerl variables must hold exactly one specific data type only.

Data types make your code much more readable and much, much faster.  Learn to love data types.  Now.  :-)

=head3 Section 2.4.1: How To Select Expressive Variable Names

Your choice of variable names will have a significant impact on the readability of your source code, whether written in Perl or any other programming language.  If the names of your variables make sense, then it will be much easier for other programmers to understand your code.  Also, good variable names will help you to understand your own code, after not looking at it for a few months or years.  Variable names may include letters, numbers, and underscores.

=for html <u>

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=over

=item * I<Variable names should be comprised of lowercase letters, numerals, and underscore characters only.>

=item * I<Variable names containing multiple words should use underscores to separate each word.>

=back

=for html </u>

You may not choose to utilize an all-uppercase variable name, because RPerl reserves that format for the names of constants; please see L</Section 2.5: Constant Data> for more information.  If you really insist, then RPerl will allow you to use mostly-uppercase variable names, as long as at least one lowercase letter is included.  Also, instead of underscores you may choose to utilize "CamelCase" in order to separate words in your variable names.  However, neither of these variable naming practices are recommended.

In addition to the best practices listed above, a good variable name should also fulfill all 3 of the following:

=for html <u>

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=over

=item * I<Meaningful: Actually describe what data the variable will hold.>

=item * I<Medium Length: Not too long, and definitely not too short.>

=item * I<Simple: Two or three common words separated by underscores is better than one obscure word.>

=back

=for html </u>

The first of these three best practices is for your variable names to be meaningful, so you should never actually choose C<$foo> or C<$bar> as your variable names, unless you are writing a programming textbook and need to make up a bunch of small stand-alone code examples.  When first choosing a variable's name, take a moment and simply think of the most descriptive word or words which explain what it is you plan to use the variable for.  Don't worry if your variable name starts out a bit too long, you can always shorten it later if appropriate.

The second best practice is for your variable names to be of medium length, so you should usually not choose either C<$r> (too short) or C<$rounding_error_from_perl_arithmetic_operators> (too long); instead, how about C<$rounding_error> (just right)?  To be fair, there are a number of commonly-accepted single-letter variable names including C<$i> and C<$j> and C<$k> for loop iterators (see L</Section 2.9.1: Loop Iterator Variables> for more information), as well as traditional mathematics variables such as C<$n> (a "number" of items) and C<$x> and C<$y> and C<$z> (Cartesian coordinates).

The third and final best practice is for your variable names to be simple, so you should usually choose C<$golden_ratio> instead of C<$phi> because more people will understand what the "golden ratio" is, and also the greek letter "phi" is ambiguous as it is traditionally used for multiple different mathematical purposes.  On the other hand, most people will understand what you mean if you give a numeric variable the name C<$circumference>, so you probably do not need to utilize the longer name C<$perimeter_length> instead.

Try your best to choose good variable names, you will thank yourself for it later.

=head3 Section 2.4.2: Boolean Data Type

The most efficient data type is C<boolean>, which is a numeric type which stores a single I<"bit"> (binary digit) of information.  A C<boolean> may only hold the values of exactly 0 or 1.

    my boolean $foo = 0;     # fine
    my boolean $bar = 1;     # fine
    my boolean $baz = -1.5;  # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes

=head3 Section 2.4.3: Unsigned Integer Data Type

The second most efficient numeric data type is C<unsigned_integer>, which stores a single whole (non-decimal) number which must have a value of 0 or greater.  An C<unsigned_integer> may not hold a negative number, and must fit within the data size limits of the data types supported by your operating system software and computer hardware.

    my unsigned_integer $foo  = -23;     # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes
    my unsigned_integer $bar  = 0;       # fine
    my unsigned_integer $baz  = 42_230;  # fine
    my unsigned_integer $bax  = 42.1;    # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes
    my unsigned_integer $quux = 999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999;  # likely error or data corruption, outside data type limits

=head3 Section 2.4.4: Integer Data Type

The third most efficient data type is C<integer>, which stores a single whole (non-decimal) number.  An C<integer> may hold any positive or negative whole number, within your computer's data type limits.

    my integer $foo  = -23;     # fine
    my integer $bar  = 0;       # fine
    my integer $baz  = 42_230;  # fine
    my integer $bax  = 42.1;    # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes
    my integer $quux = -999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999_999;  # likely error or data corruption, outside data type limits

=head3 Section 2.4.5: GMP Integer Data Type

The GNU Multi-Precision (GMP) library provides an arbitrary-precision integer data type which is accessible in RPerl as the C<gmp_integer> type, and which does not need to fit within your computer's data type limits.  All RPerl source code files which make use of GMP features must include the C<use rperlgmp;> command.  This tells RPerl to load the GMP library and other supporting software components, which are not normally loaded by the RPerl compiler.

The GMP integer data type works differently than the other normal data types, because a C<gmp_integer> can be considered a combination of a normal C<integer> data type and a special software component known as an I<"object">.  (Please see L</CHAPTER 11: CLASSES, PACKAGES, MODULES, LIBRARIES> for more information on objects.)

When we declare a new variable of the C<gmp_integer> data type, there is a 2-part initialization procedure, as opposed to a normal variable which can be declared and initialized as part of a single RPerl statement.  The first initialization statement is to declare our new C<gmp_integer> variable and pre-initialize it with a special subroutine called a I<"constructor">, which is achieved by calling C<gmp_integer-E<gt>new()> in your RPerl source code.  The second initialization statement completes the procedure by calling one of the three following GMP initialization subroutines:

=over

=item * C<gmp_init($new_gmp_var)>

=item * C<gmp_init_set_unsigned_integer($new_gmp_var, POSITIVE_INTEGER_VALUE)>

=item * C<gmp_init_set_signed_integer($new_gmp_var, INTEGER_VALUE)>

=back

The C<gmp_init()> subroutine sets the variable's value to a default of C<0>.  The C<gmp_init_set_unsigned_integer()> and C<gmp_init_set_signed_integer()> subroutines set the variable's value to the provided numeric literal value.  When you utilize the three example subroutine calls above, you should replace C<$new_gmp_var> with the name of your own C<gmp_integer> variable which has already been pre-initialized via C<gmp_integer-E<gt>new()>, and also replace C<POSITIVE_INTEGER_VALUE> or C<INTEGER_VALUE> with an actual numeric literal value.

In the source code example below, we create three new C<gmp_integer> variables which are named C<$foo>, C<$bar>, and C<$baz>, and which are initialized to the values of C<0>, C<23>, and C<-23> respectively.

    use rperlgmp;

    my gmp_integer $foo  = gmp_integer->new();
    my gmp_integer $bar  = gmp_integer->new();
    my gmp_integer $baz  = gmp_integer->new();

    gmp_init($foo);
    gmp_init_set_unsigned_integer( $bar, 23 );
    gmp_init_set_signed_integer( $baz, -23 );

Please see L</Section 2.4.14: GMP Integer Operators> for more information.

=head3 Section 2.4.6: Number Data Type

The C<number> data type stores a single floating-point (decimal) number, and may hold any real number within your computer's data type limit.

    my number $foo  = -23.42;     # fine
    my number $bar  = 0.000_001;  # fine
    my number $baz  = 42.23;      # fine
    my number $bax  = 42;         # fine
    my number $quux = -4_123.456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456_789_123_456;  # likely error or data loss, outside data type limits

=head3 Section 2.4.7: Character Data Type

The C<character> data type stores a single text character, which may include any letter or number or special character, and which must not be empty.

    my character $empty = '';    # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes, can't be empty
    my character $foo   = 'f';   # fine
    my character $bar   = q{b};  # fine
    my character $baz   = '7';   # fine
    my character $bax   = "\n";  # fine, newline counts as a single character
    my character $quux  = 'ab';  # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes, too many characters

=head3 Section 2.4.8: String Data Type

The C<string> data type stores one or more text characters, which may include any letter or number or special character, and which may be empty.

    my string $empty = '';         # fine
    my string $foo   = 'f';        # fine
    my string $bar   = q{bar};     # fine
    my string $baz   = '7baz';     # fine
    my string $bax   = "\n\n\t";   # fine, counts as 3 characters
    my string $quux  = 'abcdefg';  # fine

=head3 Section 2.4.9: Type Conversion

To convert from one data type to another, we use the RPerl data type conversion subroutines, which are automatically available for use in all RPerl source code.  All 7 RPerl data types can be converted to any of the other 6 RPerl data types, so in total there are 42 type conversion subroutines.  Remember the 7 RPerl data types are as follows:

=over

=item * boolean

=item * unsigned_integer

=item * integer

=item * gmp_integer

=item * number

=item * character

=item * string

=back

The name and calling convention of each subroutine takes the form C<SOURCE_to_DESTINATION(INPUT)>, where C<SOURCE> is replaced by the current data type from which you are converting, C<DESTINATION> is replaced by the future data type to which you wish to convert, and the argument C<INPUT> is replaced by the input data which should have the data type of C<SOURCE>.  Your C<INPUT> can be any source of scalar data such as a variable, a literal, a constant, or a subroutine which returns a scalar value.  The return value of each type conversion subroutine has a data type of C<DESTINATION>, so if you want to store the newly-converted return value for later use, then you will need to make sure you utilize a variable with the correct type.

For example, if you want to convert from the input of a C<string> variable named C<$foo> to the output of a C<number> data type, then you simply call C<string_to_number($foo)>.  If you want to store the C<number> return value of this type conversion, then you must utilize a variable of C<number> type to do so.  Thus, if you are providing a variable as the input argument for a type conversion subroutine, and if you are also storing the type conversion's return value in a variable, then these must always be two different variables because they will always have two different data types. 

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]

    use strict;

    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    my string $foo = '723.555_777';
    my number $bar = string_to_number($foo);
    my number $double_bar = $bar * 2;
    print 'have $bar = ', number_to_string($bar), "\n";
    print 'have $double_bar = ', number_to_string($double_bar), "\n";

If we run our code example above, we should receive the following output, which correctly displays the underscore digit separator for long numbers:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $bar = 723.555_777
    have $double_bar = 1_447.111_554

=for rperl X</noncode>

=for html <u>

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=over

=item * I<Numeric data types should always be converted to a C<string> data type before being passed to C<print> or otherwise displayed or saved.>

=back

=for html </u>

If we do not call the C<number_to_string()> subroutine before the values of C<$bar> and C<$double_bar> are processed by the C<print> operator, then our output will be missing the proper underscore separators:

    print 'have $bar = ', $bar, "\n";                # no number_to_string(), not best practices
    print 'have $double_bar = ', $double_bar, "\n";  # no number_to_string(), not best practices

We no longer receive the exact output desired:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $bar = 723.555777
    have $double_bar = 1447.111554

=for rperl X</noncode>

In most cases, the shorthand subroutine C<to_string()> may be used instead of one of the other C<SOURCE_to_string()> type conversion subroutines.  The special C<to_string()> data type conversion subroutine will attempt to automatically detect the data type of the input argument value.  We will receive the correct desired output if we replace C<number_to_string()> with C<to_string()> in our example above:

    print 'have $bar = ', to_string($bar), "\n";
    print 'have $double_bar = ', number_to_string($double_bar), "\n";

=for html <u>

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=over

=item * I<Numeric data should always include proper underscore separators, even when stored inside a C<string> data type.>

=back

=for html </u>

If the variable C<$foo> was a C<number> instead of a C<string>, then RPerl would give an C<ERROR ECOPARP00> parse error and complain of C<Long number not separated with underscores>.  However, since C<$foo> is of the C<string> data type, then it is not checked for proper numeric underscores, and thus we can omit the underscore in the value of C<$foo> without errors and with the proper output as seen above.  However, this is not best practices, and we should consider the underscore to be missing in the following:

    my string $foo = '723.555777';  # no underscore, not best practices

Following is a list of all 42 RPerl data type conversion subroutines, not counting the special shorthand C<to_string()> subroutine:

You must utilize type conversions when you are assigning the value of one variable to another variable of a different data type, otherwise you will have a type mismatch which will probably cause an RPerl sub-compile error.  Be aware that you may experience data loss when converting to a data type capable of storing less information:

    my integer $foo = 23;
    my number $bar  = $foo;  # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes, type mismatch

    my integer $foo = 23;
    my number $bar  = integer_to_number($foo);  # fine, $bar is now 23.0

    my number $foo  = 23.42;
    my integer $bar = $foo;  # error in RPerl, compiled (non-test) modes, type mismatch

    my number $foo  = 23.42;
    my integer $bar = number_to_integer($foo);  # fine, $bar is now 23, data loss has occurred

=head3 Section 2.4.10 Scope, Type, Name, Value

Every variable has 4 primary qualities, all of which are provided during variable initialization, in the following order:

=over

=item * I<"Scope"> is the region of source code within which a variable may be utilized.

=item * I<"Type"> is the kind of data stored in the variable, such as C<integer> or C<number> or C<string>.

=item * I<"Name"> is how you access the variable, such as C<$foo> or C<$bar>.

=item * I<"Value"> is the the data stored in the variable.

=back

The I<"scope"> of a variable describes where in the source code the variable is valid and available for use, and does not change after your RPerl software starts to execute.  In normal Perl, you will find a combination of locally-scoped variables which are declared the C<my> keyword, globally-scoped variables declared using the C<our> keyword, and state variables declared using the C<state> keyword.  (Old Perl 4 programmers also made use of the C<local> keyword, now replaced by C<my>.)

Local variables are only usable within their own enclosing code block, such as the body of a conditional statement, loop, or subroutine.  If a local variable is declared in the main operations section of an RPerl program file, then it is considered to be outside of any code block, and it may only be utilized in the operations section of its own program file.

Global variables are usable within any code block accessible by Perl.  Except for certain special variables such as C<our $VERSION>, all variables in RPerl are locally-scoped using the C<my> keyword.  RPerl does not currently support C<state> variables.

The I<"type"> of a variable is simply the data type which is stored inside the variable, as described in detail throughout the preceeding subsections of L</Section 2.4: Variables With Scalar Values>.  A variable's type must be set during declaration and may not be altered thereafter.  Remember there are 7 scalar data types in RPerl: C<boolean>, C<unsigned_integer>, C<integer>, C<gmp_integer>, C<number>, C<character>, and C<string>.

The I<"name"> of a variable is the word or phrase you type after a dollar-sign C<$> character, in order to access the variable.  Like the scope and type, a variable's name may not be changed after the point of variable declaration, when the software begins execution.  Closely related is the I<"namespace"> of a variable, which is a named group of variables and constants and possibly other things; except where specified in L</CHAPTER 11: CLASSES, PACKAGES, MODULES, LIBRARIES>, all RPerl variables exist outside of any namespace, which is to say that normal RPerl variables do not have a namespace.  

The I<"value"> of a variable is the actual data which has been stored inside of the variable, and which may be accessed or modified as your RPerl software is running.  A variable's value must be compatible with its type, otherwise an error or undefined behavior may occur.

When your RPerl application is running in normal interpreted mode AKA test mode (Perl operations and Perl data types), then you will be able to access the special subroutines C<type()>, C<types()>, C<name()> and C<scope_type_name_value()>.  These four subroutines provide the ability to perform I<"introspection"> on RPerl variables, which means your RPerl application can access information about itself, specifically about its own variables.  The C<types()> subroutine is not used for scalar data types as discussed in this chapter, please see L</CHAPTER 3: ARRAY VALUES & VARIABLES> and L</CHAPTER 6: HASH VALUES & VARIABLES> for more information.

The following source code example shows a simple C<string> variable named C<$foo> (as usual), which we then pass as an argument to the introspection subroutines and display the results:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils

    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]

    my string $foo = 'howdy';
    print 'have $foo = ', $foo, "\n";
    print 'have type($foo) = ', type($foo), "\n";
    print 'have name($foo) = ', name($foo), "\n";
    print 'have scope_type_name_value($foo) = ', "\n", scope_type_name_value($foo), "\n\n";

When this example is executed, the following output is produced:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $foo = howdy
    have type($foo) = string
    have name($foo) = $foo
    have scope_type_name_value($foo) = 
    my string $foo = 'howdy';

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 2.4.11: Binary Assignment Operators

Often you will want to increase a numeric variable by some value, which can be achieved by calling the addition C<+> operator, followed by the assignment C<=> operator:

    $foo = $foo + 1;

We can shorten this example from two operators to only one by utilizing a I<"binary assignment operator">, in this case the I<"plus-equals"> C<+=> operator:

    $foo += 1;

We can achieve this effect for the four arithmetic operators addition C<+>, subtraction C<->, multiplication C<*>, and division C</>, as well as the string concatenation C<.> operator.  The right-hand side argument is not limited to numeric literals such as C<1> in the above example, any expression can be utilized as long as it is of a compatible data type, as always.

Recall the example from the previous section, regarding the use of binary assignment operators, where we first see long-hand source code using two operators:

    $foo = $foo + 1;

Then we shorten from two operators to only one operator:

    $foo += 1;

Now, for the special case of incrementing by a hard-coded integer value of C<1>, we can shorten this example even further to eliminate the numeric literal.  This is achieved by using the post-increment C<++> operator:

    $foo++;

=for comment [ START HERE: need add tables ]

=for comment [ START HERE: need add tables ]

=for comment [ START HERE: need add tables ]

Often you will want to remove the special newline character C<"\n"> from the end of a string variable, which can be achieved safely by using the C<chomp> operator.  When you pass some variable as the operand to C<chomp>, the operator will do nothing if the operand's final character is not a newline.  Chomp knows how to use the correct newline character for each operating system, thanks to Perl's magic C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> variable.

    my string $foo = 'howdy' . "\n";
    print $foo;
    print $foo;

    chomp $foo;  # newline character removed
    print $foo;
    print $foo;

    chomp $foo;  # no effect
    print $foo;
    print $foo;

In the example source code above, only the first call to the C<chomp> operator has an effect on the value of the C<$foo> variable.  When you run this example source code, you should receive the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    howdy
    howdy
    howdyhowdyhowdyhowdy

=for rperl X</noncode>

Sometimes you will want to trim the final character of a string variable, regardless of whether it is a newline or any other specific character.  For these cases, you will want to use the C<chop> operator, which is likened to a non-safe variant of C<chomp>.  Obviously, C<chop> and C<chomp> actually perform two different operations, so you will always need to be careful and choose which operator to utilize on a case-by-case basis.

Let's modify the previous code example to use the C<chop> operator instead of C<chomp>:

    my string $foo = 'howdy' . "\n";
    print $foo;
    print $foo;

    chop $foo;    # newline character removed
    print $foo;
    print $foo;

    chop $foo;    # 'y' character removed
    print $foo;
    print $foo;

The trailing newline character is trimmed on the first call to C<chop>, and then the final 'y' character of C<'howdy'> is deleted on the second call to the C<chop> operator.  This generates the following output, notice the missing 'y' characters:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    howdy
    howdy
    howdyhowdyhowdhowd

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 2.4.14: GMP Integer Operators

The GMP library provides a large number of operators which are only for use with variables of the C<gmp_integer> data type, and these GMP operators are made available in RPerl as subroutines which all begin with "gmp_".  These GMP operator subroutines are loaded by the C<use rperlgmp;> command.

=head2 Section 2.5: Constant Data

Sometimes you have a piece of data that will never change once you compile your software, which is what we call I<"constant data"> or just a I<"constant"> for short.

Constants are the opposite of variables, because constants are designed not to change, while variables are designed to change as many times as needed.

Below is an example RPerl program with two constants, one containing numeric data and another containing text data:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
 
    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;
 
    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitConstantPragma ProhibitMagicNumbers)  # USER DEFAULT 3: allow constants
 
    # [[[ CONSTANTS ]]]
    use constant PI  => my number $TYPED_PI  = 3.141_59;
    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = 'pecan';

These two constants can be utilized as follows:

    my number $area = PI() * $r ** 2;
    my string $dessert = 'having a nice slice of ' . PIE();

As seen in the examples above, we must first declare each constant to have an all-uppercase name via the C<use constant> command, after which we can access the stored data value by calling the constant name followed by empty parentheses.  (In normal interpreted Perl, a constant is functionally equivalent to a subroutine which accepts no arguments and performs no operations other than to call the C<return> operator with a hard-coded data value; see L</CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZING BY SUBROUTINES> for more information.)

In all RPerl source code files which contain constants, we must include the "USER DEFAULT 3" C<no critic> command; for numeric constants, we must also include "USER DEFAULT 1", as seen in the code example above.

All constants must utilize names with uppercase-only lettering, in order to distinguish them from similarly-named variables.  Thus, a normal variable may not have an all-uppercase name.  (Special variables called I<"file handles"> must be all-uppercase; see L</CHAPTER 5: READING & WRITING FILES> for more information.)

    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = 'peanut butter';  # fine
    use constant Pie => my string $TYPED_Pie = 'coffee cream';   # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    use constant pie => my string $TYPED_pie = 'mocha silk';     # error in RPerl, compiled modes

    my string $PIE = 'oreo';        # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    my string $Pie = 'blackberry';  # okay
    my string $pie = 'blueberry';   # best

The declaration of constants follows a purposefully-repetitive format starting with the C<use constant> command, followed by the all-uppercase constant name, a fat-arrow (AKA fat-comma) C<=E<gt>>, the C<my> command, the desired data type, a variable named C<$TYPED_> with the same all-uppercase name appended, the equal-sign C<=> assignment operator, and finally the desired data value with a closing semicolon.  Within a constant declaration, the all-uppercase constant name must appear identically in both places, which is a language construct enabling us to provide a data type where it would otherwise be impossible to do so.

    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = 'cherry';        # fine
    use constant PIE =>                        'black forest';  # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PI  = 'grasshopper';   # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_POE = 'raven';         # error in RPerl, compiled modes

You may access the value of a constant as many times as you like, but you may never change the value once the software has been compiled.

    $pie = PIE();       # fine
    $pie = $PIE;        # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    $pie = $TYPED_PIE;  # error in RPerl, compiled modes

    PIE()      = 'chocolate bourbon';   # error in Perl and RPerl
    $PIE       = 'chocolate chip';      # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    $TYPED_PIE = 'death by chocolate';  # error in RPerl, compiled modes

Constant values must be literals and not other constants or variables.

    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = 'banana cream';  # fine
    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = PI();            # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = $pie;            # error in RPerl, compiled modes

It is always possible to use a variable instead of a constant, but not the other way around.
You should use constants whenever possible, because they will always be at least as fast as variables, and often faster!

                        my string $pie       = 'lemon meringue';  # okay
    use constant PIE => my string $TYPED_PIE = 'key lime';        # best

=head2 Section 2.6: Displaying Output Using The C<print> Operator

You will often want to display some text output while your RPerl application is running, and for this we use the C<print> operator:

    print 'Hello, World!', "\n";

Unsurprisingly, calling C<print> as shown above will display the 13-character global greeting, followed by a special I<"newline"> character which moves the computer cursor down to the next line.  (The "n" in "\n" stands for "newline", which is very closely related to the concepts of I<"line feed">, I<"carriage return">, and pressing the I<"Enter"> key on a computer keyboard.  The history of these terms harkens back to the days of manual typewriters and is worth spending a few minutes to learn about on Wikipedia, if you are into that sort of thing.)

Multiple operands are passed to the C<print> operator by separating them with commas.  The above example passes 2 operands to be received by the C<print> operator, first the greeting literal and second the newline character.  You may pass as many operands to C<print> as you like.

You can also print the contents of variables and constants.  For example, the 3 operations below produce the exact same output as the 1 operation above:

    use constant NEWLINE => my string $TYPED_NEWLINE = "\n";
    my string $greeting = 'Hello, World!';
    print $greeting, NEWLINE();

=head3 Section 2.6.1: C<STDOUT> & C<STDERR>

When you call the C<print> operator, it sends all output to the operating system's default output data stream, which is a special component called I<"standard output"> or just I<"standard out"> for short, written using the C<STDOUT> keyword in Perl.  You may explicitly specify C<STDOUT> for any C<print> operator, although this is not necessary because it is already the default behavior.  When specified, the output stream has an asterisk C<*> character prepended, and is then wrapped in curly-braces. 

So again, the following operation produces the exact same output as the 2 preceding examples:

    print {*STDOUT} 'Hello, World', "\n";

You will notice there is no comma after C<{*STDOUT}>; you should only type a blank space character, and then specify the first operand.  Other than that, the C<print> operator works exactly the same both with and without the extra C<STDOUT> included.

In addition to C<STDOUT>, there is a second output data stream provided by your operating system, which is called I<"standard error"> and is written using the C<STDERR> keyword.  This stream is used to display actual error and warning messages, as well as optional debugging and diagnostic information.  The following operation will display an example warning message:

    print {*STDERR} 'WARNING: Danger, Will Robinson!', "\n";

Your software will continue running after you call C<print> to send output to C<STDERR>; if you want execution to immediately stop after displaying an error message, then you will need to explicitly add a termination operator such as C<exit> or C<die> or C<croak>.  The operand value of C<1> passed to the C<exit> operator below is used to inform the operating system that we have encountered an error.  (Please see NEED_ADD_SECTION for more information.)

    print {*STDERR} 'ERROR: A fatal error or failure has occurred, aborting.', "\n";
    exit 1;

As mentioned above, you may also choose to use C<STDERR> to display debugging and diagnostic messages, which are neither warnings nor errors.  For example, let's say you are writing an RPerl application which primarily relies on the C<$foo> variable, so your users want to see the value of C<$foo> when the program is finished running.  Your code also utilizes the secondary variables named C<$bar>, C<$bat>, and C<$baz>, but the users don't care about the values of these variables, only you (and other software developers) care about them.  Following is an example of using C<print> for both normal output to C<STDOUT> (by default), as well as diagnostic output to C<STDERR>:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils

    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]

    my number  $bar =    17.0;
    my number  $bat = 2_112.42;
    my integer $baz =    23;
    my number  $foo;

    print {*STDERR} 'before arithmetic, have $bar = ', number_to_string($bar), "\n";
    print {*STDERR} 'before arithmetic, have $bat = ', number_to_string($bat), "\n";
    print {*STDERR} 'before arithmetic, have $baz = ', integer_to_string($baz), "\n";

    $bat = $bar;
    $bar = $baz / ($bar * 3);
    $baz = $baz + 1;
    $foo = $bar + $bat;

    print '$foo = ', number_to_string($foo), "\n";

    print {*STDERR} 'after arithmetic, have $bar = ', number_to_string($bar), "\n";
    print {*STDERR} 'after arithmetic, have $bat = ', number_to_string($bat), "\n";
    print {*STDERR} 'after arithmetic, have $baz = ', integer_to_string($baz), "\n";

Now you may easily choose to view only the C<STDOUT>, or C<STDERR>, or both.  Here we see a normal execution of the program with both output streams displayed:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ ./my_program.pl 
    before arithmetic, have $bar = 17
    before arithmetic, have $bat = 2_112.42
    before arithmetic, have $baz = 23
    $foo = 17.450_980_392_156_9
    after arithmetic, have $bar = 0.450_980_392_156_863
    after arithmetic, have $bat = 17
    after arithmetic, have $baz = 24

=for rperl X</noncode>

Next, we execute the same program again; this time we append C<E<gt> /dev/null> after our program name, which discards all C<STDOUT> output by redirecting it to a I<"null"> or empty device.  (In the Windows operating system, replace C<E<gt> /dev/null> with C<E<gt> nul>.)  This results in only the C<STDERR> output being displayed:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ ./my_program.pl > /dev/null
    before arithmetic, have $bar = 17
    before arithmetic, have $bat = 2_112.42
    before arithmetic, have $baz = 23
    after arithmetic, have $bar = 0.450_980_392_156_863
    after arithmetic, have $bat = 17
    after arithmetic, have $baz = 24

=for rperl X</noncode>

Lastly, we run the same program a third time, now with C<2E<gt> /dev/null> appended to discard all C<STDERR> output, so we only see C<STDOUT>:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ ./my_program.pl 2> /dev/null
    $foo = 17.450_980_392_156_9

=for rperl X</noncode>

It is easy to simply insert a hash character (AKA octothorpe) C<#> in front of each C<print {*STDERR}> operator to comment it out, thereby disabling the diagnostic output but allowing it to be re-enabled again by future developers:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils

    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]

    my number  $bar =    17.0;
    my number  $bat = 2_112.42;
    my integer $baz =    23;
    my number  $foo;

    #print {*STDERR} 'before arithmetic, have $bar = ', number_to_string($bar), "\n";
    #print {*STDERR} 'before arithmetic, have $bat = ', number_to_string($bat), "\n";
    #print {*STDERR} 'before arithmetic, have $baz = ', integer_to_string($baz), "\n";

    $bat = $bar;
    $bar = $baz / ($bar * 3);
    $baz = $baz + 1;
    $foo = $bar + $bat;

    print '$foo = ', number_to_string($foo), "\n";

    #print {*STDERR} 'after arithmetic, have $bar = ', number_to_string($bar), "\n";
    #print {*STDERR} 'after arithmetic, have $bat = ', number_to_string($bat), "\n";
    #print {*STDERR} 'after arithmetic, have $baz = ', integer_to_string($baz), "\n";

Now we don't need any redirection on the command line to suppress C<STDERR> output, and our program will run faster:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ ./my_program.pl
    $foo = 17.450_980_392_156_9

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head2 Section 2.7: Program Control Using The C<if> Conditional Statement

Often you will want to perform a task, but only if some specific I<"condition"> is met; this is called a I<"conditional statement"> or just I<"conditional"> for short, and is implemented using the C<if> statement in Perl.  You may also refer to the C<if> statement as a I<"control structure">, because it is a source code structure used to control the execution flow of a piece of Perl software.  In other words, a conditional statement can control how your software runs, and so your software may run differently depending on your conditional statements.

Whether or not an C<if> statement's task is actually performed is determined by the truth value of its condition, which is specified in the loop's I<"header">, contained within parentheses immediately after the C<if> keyword; please review L</Section 2.1.9: Truth Values> for more information.  The header of a conditional statement contains only its condition.  The task to be conditionally performed is known as the conditional statement's I<"body">, and is specified within curly-braces immediately after the header.

    if ( $my_integer == 17 ) { print 'I got seventeen!', "\n"; }

We can read the source code above as "if the value of the variable $my_integer is equal to 17, then display the text 'I got seventeen!' followed by a newline character"; or for short we can just say "if $my_integer is 17, print 'I got seventeen!'".  Note the use of the word "then" in the long-form translation; C<if> statements are also commonly referred to as I<"if - then"> statements, although in Perl the word "then" is not used in actual source code.  We will include the word "then" in the translations below, for ease of comprehension.

=head3 Section 2.7.1: Conditional Chaining With C<if> & C<elsif> & C<else>

So, what if you also want to perform a different task when your C<if> statement's condition is evaluated as false?  Then use the C<else> keyword with its own body:

    if ( $my_integer == 17 ) { print 'I got seventeen!',         "\n"; }
    else                     { print 'I did not get seventeen.', "\n"; }

We can read the two lines of code above as "if $my_integer is 17, then print 'I got seventeen!'; or else print 'I did not get seventeen.'".

Now let's add a third check, to see if we match one more possible value of C<$my_integer> before declaring that these aren't the values (or droids) we're looking for.  The following three lines of code can be read as "if $my_integer is 17, then print 'I got seventeen!'; or else if $my_integer is 23, then print 'I got twenty-three!'; or else print 'I did not get either.'":

    if    ( $my_integer == 17 ) { print 'I got seventeen!',      "\n"; }
    elsif ( $my_integer == 23 ) { print 'I got twenty-three!',   "\n"; }
    else                        { print 'I did not get either.', "\n"; }

When at least one C<elsif> or C<else> statement is appended to an C<if> statement, it is called a I<"conditional chain">.

Now let's look at the output values of some slightly less simple conditional statements.  For example, perhaps you want to increment the value of an integer stored in the variable named C<$heart>, but only until it reaches a value of 3.  You can achieve this (in a contrived manner) by executing the following RPerl program:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils

    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]

    my integer $heart = 0;
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }

    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

What do you think will be the generated output from the code above?  Well here it is:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $heart = 0
    $heart = 3

=for rperl X</noncode>

By studying the source code and output above, we can see there are five opportunities for the value of the C<$heart> variable to be incremented via the C<++> operator, but only three of them are actually executed.  This is because the truth value of C<$heart E<lt> 3> is true while C<$heart> is equal to 0, 1, and 2, but then the truth value of C<$heart E<lt> 3> becomes false once the value of C<$heart> reaches 3.  Obviously, a value of 3 is not less-than another equal value of 3, so the final 2 truth values are false.

According to the generated output, it appears we have achieved our simple goal of incrementing C<$heart> until it reaches 3, but it can be difficult to know exactly what is happening while the program is running.  Let's add some C<print> operators to display more useful output:

    my integer $heart = 0;
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

Now we can see what's really going on:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $heart = 0
    $heart = 1
    $heart = 2
    $heart = 3
    $heart = 3
    $heart = 3

=for rperl X</noncode>

From this more informative output, we can see the final two C<print> operators are called, but the final two increment C<++> operators are not called, so "$heart = 3" is repeated twice.

Each of the five C<if> statements in the previous example are syntactically independent conditional statements, which means you can change any of their conditions without affecting the evaluation of the other conditions.  In other words, all five conditions with all five less-than C<E<lt>> operators are evaluated every time this program runs, even if only three of the five C<if> statement bodies are executed.  This is fine, because it is the correct behavior we want in this example.

Now let's say (for some odd reason) you want to chain three C<if> statements together where they are now dependent upon one another, so if you change any one condition then it may affect the evaluation of the following condition(s).  You can achieve this by changing the second and third C<if> statements to be C<elsif> statements instead:

    my integer $heart = 0;
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    elsif ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    elsif ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }

    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

We can't include all the extra C<print> operators because each C<elsif> keyword must follow immediately after the preceding conditional body.  Also, we can't link more than three C<if> statements together without breaking the Perl Best Practices guideline against utilizing a "cascading if-elsif chain".

So what do you think the output will for the above conditional chain?  Here you go:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $heart = 0
    $heart = 1

=for rperl X</noncode>

This time only the first of the three increment C<++> operators was executed, so the value of C<$heart> only increased from 0 to 1.  This is because an C<elsif> statement's condition will automatically default to a truth value of false if any preceding C<if> or C<elsif> truth values in its conditional chain are evaluated as true.  In other words, both C<elsif> statements in this example were totally skipped or I<"short-circuited"> without even evaluating their less-than C<E<lt>> operators, because the condition of the starting C<if> statement is evaluated as a true.  It would literally be a waste of time to evaluate the second and third less-than operators, so our program will run a little bit faster by allowing Perl to automatically skip over those C<elsif> statements completely.

Can you quickly tell what the output will be for the following example, where we have simply added an C<else> statement?

    my integer $heart = 0;
    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

    if ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    elsif ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    elsif ( $heart < 3 ) { $heart++; }
    else                 { $heart++; }

    print '$heart = ', $heart, "\n";

In this case, the same short-circuiting occurs for the C<else> as does for the C<elsif> statements in this and the previous example, so our output is unchanged:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $heart = 0
    $heart = 1

=for rperl X</noncode>

The longest conditional chain allowable by Perl Best Practices is four members long and is comprised of an C<if> statement, followed by two C<elsif> statements, followed by an C<else> statement, as seen in the example above.  If all your conditions test a single variable for equivalence to some specific values, as in our first C<$my_integer> examples in this section, then instead of a conditional chain you may be able to utilize a hash data structure with the keys pre-set to the possible matching values; please see L</CHAPTER 6: HASH VALUES & VARIABLES> for more information.

If your conditions are not all simple equivalence tests via the equals C<==> operator, as in our C<$heart> examples where the conditions include less-than C<E<lt>> operators, then Perl Best Practices directs us to use a C<given ... when> statement instead of any C<if> or C<elsif> statements at all.  However, RPerl does not yet support C<given ... when>, so if it is unavoidable then you may disable the rule against cascading conditional chains for just one source code file at a time:

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitCascadingIfElse)  # USER DEFAULT 9: allow cascading conditional chains until given-when is implemented
    
    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]
    
    my integer $foo = 0;
    print '$foo = ', $foo, "\n";
    
    if ( $foo < 3 ) { $foo++; }
    elsif ( $foo < 3 ) { $foo++; }
    elsif ( $foo < 3 ) { $foo++; }
    elsif ( $foo < 3 ) { $foo++; }
    else               { $foo++; }
    
    print '$foo = ', $foo, "\n";

As seen above, now we may add one or more additional C<elsif> statements without triggering a Perl Best Practices violation error via Perl::Critic.  This is achieved by the inclusion of the special "USER DEFAULT 9" C<no critic> command, which disables the "ProhibitCascadingIfElse" policy.  If we attempt to run this source code without the proper critic command, we will receive an error:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t my_program.pl 
    ERROR ECOPAPC02, RPERL PARSER, PERL CRITIC VIOLATION
    Failed Perl::Critic brutal review with the following information:

        Description:  Cascading if-elsif chain
        Explanation:  See Perl Best Practices page(s) 117, 118

=for rperl X</noncode>

However, with the proper "USER DEFAULT 9" C<no critic> command in place, we receive no errors and the same output as before:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $heart = 0
    $heart = 1

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 2.7.2: Nested Conditionals

In all the examples above, the body of each conditional statement only includes one operation, such as a single increment C<++> operator or a single C<print> operator.  However, the bodies of your conditional statements may include as many operations as you like.  Also, conditional statements may be nested within one another:

    if ( $friend_enjoys_lasagna ) {
        if ( $other_lasagna_lovers_so_far == 0 ) {
            print 'Oh thank goodness, I thought I was the only one!', "\n";
        }
        elsif ( $other_lasagna_lovers_so_far == 1 ) {
            print 'Well, at least there are a few of us...', "\n";
        }
        else {
            print 'Welcome to the Lasagna Lovers club!', "\n";
        }
        $other_lasagna_lovers_so_far++;
    }
    else {
        print 'Why would anyone NOT like lasagna?', "\n";
    }

=head3 Section 2.7.3: Conditionals & Variable Declarations

When a variable is declared inside the body of any conditional statement, then said variable may only be utilized from within that same conditional body (or any nested bodies within it).  In all the previous examples, we are implying unseen variable declarations which happen before (and thus outside) the conditional bodies, so all our example variables may be accessed or modified outside the conditional statements themselves.

If a variable is declared within a conditional's statement's body, then we will receive an error if we try to utilize it outside the conditional:

    my integer $foo = 0;
    print 'outside conditional, have $foo = ', $foo, "\n";
    
    if ( $foo < 3 ) {
        $foo++;
        my integer $bar = $foo * 2;
        print 'inside  conditional, have $bar = ', $bar, "\n";
    }
    
    print 'outside conditional, have $foo = ', $foo, "\n";
    print 'outside conditional, have $bar = ', $bar, "\n";  # THIS CAUSES A PARSE ERROR

If we run the code above, the last line attempts to access the C<$bar> variable outside of the conditional body where it was declared, so we receive an error:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    ERROR ECOPAPL02, RPERL PARSER, PERL SYNTAX ERROR
    Failed normal Perl strictures-and-fatal-warnings syntax check with the following information:

=for rperl X</noncode>

If we simply remove the last line where C<$bar> is incorrectly accessed, then our code runs fine:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    outside conditional, have $foo = 0
    inside  conditional, have $bar = 2
    outside conditional, have $foo = 1

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head2 Section 2.8: Receiving Input From The User & C<STDIN>

When you want the users of your software to provide some keyboard input, then you will need to use the C<STDIN> keyword in Perl, which represents the I<"standard input"> data stream.  This will allow the user to type one line of input text and numbers, ended by pressing the Enter key.  All user input is received in text format, and should initially be stored in a variable with a C<string> data type.  Unless converted to a different data type via one of RPerl's type conversion subroutines, the string variable should be passed to the C<chomp> operator, which will remove the trailing newline character collected by C<STDIN>. 

When used in Perl, we wrap C<STDIN> with I<"angle-brackets">, which start with the less-than C<E<lt>> character and end with the greater-than C<E<gt>> character.  In this context, the less-than and greater-than characters are not used as tests for numeric inequality.  Also, when using C<STDIN> in RPerl we must always include the "USER DEFAULT 4" C<no critic> command, which enables use of C<STDIN> in general.

Along with the two output streams C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR>, the input stream C<STDIN> makes up the third of three standard I/O ("input / output") data streams available on most operating systems. 

The following example asks the user for their name, then greets them by name:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitExplicitStdin)  # USER DEFAULT 4: allow <STDIN> prompt

    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]

    print 'Please input your first name: ';
    my string $first_name = <STDIN>;
    chomp $first_name;
    print 'Hello ', $first_name, ', nice to meet you!', "\n";

One possible execution of this example, with the input name "Will", produces the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Please input your first name: Will
    Hello Will, nice to meet you!

=for rperl X</noncode>

You may also receive numeric data input, with the use of the appropriate data type conversion subroutines:

    print 'Please input your age in years: ';
    my string $age_string = <STDIN>;
    my integer $age = string_to_integer($age_string);
    print 'You are ', integer_to_string($age), ' years old.', "\n";
    print 'In one year from now, you will be ', integer_to_string($age + 1), ' years old.', "\n";

In the above example, you may optionally omit the two calls to the C<integer_to_string()> data type conversion subroutine, because it has no effect on any integer with a value less-than 1,000.  One possible execution produces the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Please input your age in years: 34
    You are 34 years old.
    In one year from now, you will be 35 years old.

=for rperl X</noncode>

You may receive input from C<STDIN> as many times as needed:

    print 'Please input your favorite band or musician: ';
    my string $favorite_band = <STDIN>;
    chomp $favorite_band;
    
    print 'Please input your favorite movie: ';
    my string $favorite_movie = <STDIN>;
    chomp $favorite_movie;
    
    print 'Please input your favorite TV show: ';
    my string $favorite_show = <STDIN>;

    print 'You are a fan of ', $favorite_band, ', ', $favorite_movie, ', and ', $favorite_show, q{.}, "\n";
    print '(I like Rush, Blade Runner, and Star Trek!)', "\n";

One possible run of this example produces:

=head2 Section 2.9: Program Control Using The C<while> Loop

Most programs will contain one or more operations which need to be repeated a certain number of times, and for these cases we use a I<"loop statement"> or just a I<"loop"> for short.  Like a conditional statement, a loop statement is a kind of control structure, because they are both used to control the execution flow of your software.

In this section, we will describe the most basic loop in Perl, which is the C<while> loop statement.  Just like an C<if> conditional statement, a C<while> loop has both a header containing only a condition, and a body of operations.  There is only one difference between C<if> and C<while> statements: C<if> executes once when the condition is true, and C<while> executes repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

The following loop will never stop running, because it has a condition which is hard-coded to numeric literal C<1>, which has a truth value of true.  This is called an I<"infinite loop">, and it will repeatedly print an unending amount of global greetings until the user sends a CTRL-C or similar termination signal:

    while (1) { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; }

As with an C<if> conditional statement, a C<while> loop's condition may be any truth value, which is usually generated by a numeric comparison operator such as less-than C<E<lt>> and greater-than C<E<gt>> and equals C<==>, or a logical operator such as C<and> and C<or> and C<not>.  Also like a conditional statement, a loop's body may include as many operations as needed, on as many lines as needed.

=head3 Section 2.9.1: Loop Iterator Variables

Many loops use a designated variable called an I<"iterator">, utilized for the sole purpose of keeping track of the current iteration count.  Traditionally this variable is named C<$i>, and its value is increased by one via the increment C<++> operator called as the last operation in a loop body.  The value of C<$i> would then be tested via numeric comparison in the loop's condition:

    my integer $i = 0;
    while ( $i < 5 ) {
        print 'Hello, World #', $i, q{!}, "\n";
        $i++;
    }

In the example above, we first declare our iterator C<$i> to start counting at a hard-coded numeric literal value of C<0>.  All of computer science is based on binary logic with two possible binary values of 0 and 1; because of this and other reasons discussed in chapter 3, most counters and iterators start with 0 as their first value, 1 as their second value, and so forth.  When C<$i> starts at 0 and uses a less-than C<E<lt>> operator to be compared to a certain maximum iteration value, then your C<while> loop will iterate exactly that many times.  

When we run the code above, we receive the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World #0!
    Hello, World #1!
    Hello, World #2!
    Hello, World #3!
    Hello, World #4!

=for rperl X</noncode>

If you really want to start C<$i> at 1 instead of 0, then you have to use a less-than-or-equal C<E<lt>=> operator to perform the same number of iterations:

    my integer $i = 1;
    while ( $i <= 5 ) {
        print 'Hello, World #', $i, q{!}, "\n";
        $i++;
    }

Now our output seems to make more sense to a human, but our iterator variable C<$i> is no longer starting at 0:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World #1!
    Hello, World #2!
    Hello, World #3!
    Hello, World #4!
    Hello, World #5!

=for rperl X</noncode>

In order to have our iterator C<$i> start at 0, and also have our output make sense to a human, we call the addition C<+> operator within parentheses as part of the C<print> operator:

    my integer $i = 0;
    while ( $i < 5 ) {
        print 'Hello, World #', ( $i + 1 ), q{!}, "\n";
        $i++;
    }

Now we receive the desired output with C<$i> starting at 0:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World #1!
    Hello, World #2!
    Hello, World #3!
    Hello, World #4!
    Hello, World #5!

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 2.9.2: Nested Loops

As with the C<if> conditional statements, multiple C<while> loops may be nested within one another.  When you want to have iterator variables for 2 or even 3 nested loops, the traditional naming convention for simple cases is to start with iterator C<$i> for the outer-most loop, then iterator C<$j> for the next loop nested within the C<$i> loop, and then iterator C<$k> for the loop nested within the C<$j> loop.  If you need more or different iterators, you may choose any variable names which you find appropriate.

Also as with C<if> conditional statements, when a variable is declared inside the body of a C<while> loop statement, then said variable may only be utilized from within that same loop body (or any nested bodies within it).  In the previous example, the integer variable C<$i> is declared before the loop, so it may be accessed or modified outside the loop.  In the next example, the variable C<$j> is declared within the outer loop, so C<$j> may not be utilized outside the outer loop.

Let's take a look at the simplest example of 3 nested loops:

    my integer $i = 0;
    while ( $i < 5 ) {
        my integer $j = 0;
        while ( $j < 4 ) {
            my integer $k = 0;
            while ( $k < 3 ) {
                print 'Hello, World #(', ( $i + 1 ), ', ', ( $j + 1 ), ', ', ( $k + 1 ), q{)!}, "\n";
                $k++;
            }
            $j++;
        }
        $i++;
    }

In each line of the generated output, the first number is from the outer-most C<$i> loop, the second number is from the middle C<$j> loop, and the last number is from the inner-most C<$k> loop:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World #(1, 1, 1)!
    Hello, World #(1, 1, 2)!
    Hello, World #(1, 2, 1)!
    Hello, World #(1, 2, 2)!
    Hello, World #(1, 3, 1)!
    Hello, World #(1, 3, 2)!
    Hello, World #(2, 1, 1)!
    Hello, World #(2, 1, 2)!
    Hello, World #(2, 2, 1)!
    Hello, World #(2, 2, 2)!
    Hello, World #(2, 3, 1)!
    Hello, World #(2, 3, 2)!
    Hello, World #(3, 1, 1)!
    Hello, World #(3, 1, 2)!
    Hello, World #(3, 2, 1)!
    Hello, World #(3, 2, 2)!
    Hello, World #(3, 3, 1)!
    Hello, World #(3, 3, 2)!
    Hello, World #(4, 1, 1)!
    Hello, World #(4, 1, 2)!
    Hello, World #(4, 2, 1)!
    Hello, World #(4, 2, 2)!
    Hello, World #(4, 3, 1)!
    Hello, World #(4, 3, 2)!

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 2.9.3: Loop Control Operators C<next> & C<last>

Sometimes you need to skip to the next loop iteration immediately, without finishing the current iteration.  For this, we use the C<next> operator:

    my integer $i = 0;
    
    print 'before    loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    
    while ( $i < 10 ) {
        print "\n";
        print 'top    of loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        if ( $i % 2 ) { next; }
        print 'bottom of loop, have next    $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";

As you can see, we can freely mix C<if> conditional statements with C<while> loop statements.  When we run the code above, the C<print> operator at the bottom of the loop's body is reached only when the incremented C<$i> is even, because odd values of C<$i> will cause the modulo C<%> operator to evaluate as a truth value of true, which then calls the C<next> operator:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 1
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 2
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 2
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 3
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 4
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 4
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 5
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 6
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 6
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 7
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 8
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 8
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 9
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 10
    
    after     loop, have current $i = 10

=for rperl X</noncode>

Sometimes you need to exit a loop immediately, without finishing the current iteration; for this, we use the C<last> operator.  Let's take the previous example and simply replace the C<next> operator with C<last> instead:

    my integer $i = 0;
    
    print 'before    loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    
    while ( $i < 10 ) {
        print "\n";
        print 'top    of loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        if ( $i % 2 ) { last; }
        print 'bottom of loop, have next    $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";

When we run the code above, the C<print> operator at the bottom of the loop's body is never reached and the loop only executes for one (partial) iteration, because the very first incremented value of C<$i> is odd and will cause the modulo C<%> operator to evaluate as true, which then immediately calls the C<last> operator:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 0
    
    after     loop, have current $i = 1

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 2.9.4: Loop Labels & Loop Control Operator C<redo>

Sometimes you need to restart a loop's current iteration, without actually finishing the current iteration first or re-executing the loop's header; for this, we use the C<redo> operator.  However, before we use the C<redo> operator, we must first learn about loop labels.

When using nested loops, it can be confusing to keep track of which loop is being affected by which loop control operator.  To solve this issue, we use loop labels, which are simply all-uppercase names prepended to the loop keyword, which is C<while> in this case.  The use of loop labels is optional in most cases, but is required when you want to reliably use loop control operators inside nested loops, and whenever you want to use the C<redo> operator at all.

Let's take the previous example again, add the loop label C<MY_LOOP>, and simply replace the C<last> operator with C<redo MY_LOOP> instead:

    my integer $i = 0;
    
    print 'before    loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    
    MY_LOOP: while ( $i < 10 ) {
        print "\n";
        print 'top    of loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        if ( $i % 2 ) { redo MY_LOOP; }
        print 'bottom of loop, have next    $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";

When we run the code above, we see the C<redo> operator provides the exact same behavior as C<next> in this case, but that only applies to some C<while> loops and will not always be true.  (In the next chapter we will learn about another kind of loop, where C<next> and C<redo> never behave the same.)

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 1
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 2
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 2
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 3
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 4
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 4
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 5
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 6
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 6
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 7
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 8
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 8
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 9
    bottom of loop, have next    $i = 10
    
    after     loop, have current $i = 10

=for rperl X</noncode>

The C<redo> operator does not re-execute its corresponding loop's header, it jumps directly to the first operation in the loop's body and continues execution from there.  In contrast, the C<next> operator does execute the loop's header, which in the case of C<while> is comprised only of checking the loop's condition.

The following source code example is comprised of a C<while> loop containing an C<if> conditional with a "bail out" condition:

    my integer $i = 0;
    
    print 'before    loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n\n";
    
    MY_LOOP: while ( $i < 5 ) {
        print 'top    of loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        if ( $i > 10 ) {
            print 'inside of loop, have next    $i = ', $i, '; value too big, bailing out!', "\n";
            last MY_LOOP;
        }
        next MY_LOOP;
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";

When we run the example code above, we never reach the C<last> operator inside the loop, because the C<next> operator causes the loop's condition to be checked and the loop stops iterating before C<$i> reaches a value greater-than C<10>.  In fact, we could totally delete the C<next MY_LOOP> line as well as the entire C<if> conditional statement, and we would still receive the same output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 0
    top    of loop, have current $i = 1
    top    of loop, have current $i = 2
    top    of loop, have current $i = 3
    top    of loop, have current $i = 4
    
    after     loop, have current $i = 5

=for rperl X</noncode>

In the following code, we have simply replaced C<next MY_LOOP> with C<last MY_LOOP>:

    my integer $i = 0;
    
    print 'before    loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n\n";
    
    MY_LOOP: while ( $i < 5 ) {
        print 'top    of loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        if ( $i > 10 ) {
            print 'inside of loop, have next    $i = ', $i, '; value too big, bailing out!', "\n";
            last MY_LOOP;
        }
        last MY_LOOP;
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";

As before, the body of the C<if> conditional statement is never executed because C<$i> never reaches a value higher than 10.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, running this code produces a relatively short output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 0
    
    after     loop, have current $i = 1

=for rperl X</noncode>

Of course, we will now replace C<next MY_LOOP> with C<redo MY_LOOP>:

    my integer $i = 0;
    
    print 'before    loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n\n";
    
    MY_LOOP: while ( $i < 5 ) {
        print 'top    of loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        if ( $i > 10 ) {
            print 'inside of loop, have next    $i = ', $i, '; value too big, bailing out!', "\n";
            last MY_LOOP;
        }
        redo MY_LOOP;
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";

The C<redo> operator does not cause the C<while> loop's header to be executed, so the C<$i E<lt> 5> condition is only checked the very first iteration.  Therefore, the value of C<$i> continues to increase until it is greater-than C<10> and triggers the "bail out" mechanism.  (If only the economy was this simple.)

When we run the code, this is the output we see displayed:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    loop, have current $i = 0
    
    top    of loop, have current $i = 0
    top    of loop, have current $i = 1
    top    of loop, have current $i = 2
    top    of loop, have current $i = 3
    top    of loop, have current $i = 4
    top    of loop, have current $i = 5
    top    of loop, have current $i = 6
    top    of loop, have current $i = 7
    top    of loop, have current $i = 8
    top    of loop, have current $i = 9
    top    of loop, have current $i = 10
    inside of loop, have next    $i = 11; value too big, bailing out!
    
    after     loop, have current $i = 11

=for rperl X</noncode>

Now we will look at at a simple nested loop example; we have 2 loops with the C<last> operator called from the body of the inner loop:

    my integer $i = 0;
    my integer $j = 0;
    
    print 'before    outer loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    print 'before    outer loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";
    
    while ( $i < 3 ) {
        print "\n";
        print 'top    of outer loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        $j = 0;
        while ( $j < 5 ) {
            print 'top    of inner loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";
            $j++;
            if ( $j > 2 ) { next; }
            print 'bottom of inner loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";
        }
        print 'bottom of outer loop, have next    $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     outer loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    print 'after     outer loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";

When we run this code we can see that for every iteration of the outer loop, the bottom of the inner loop is only reached twice, when the current value of C<$j> is less-than C<2>.  This is because when the C<next> operator is called without a loop label, then it is applied to most immediate loop, which means C<next> is applied to the inner loop in this case:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    outer loop, have current $i = 0
    before    outer loop, have current $j = 0
    
    top    of outer loop, have current $i = 0
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 0
    bottom of inner loop, have current $j = 1
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 1
    bottom of inner loop, have current $j = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 3
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 4
    bottom of outer loop, have next    $i = 1
    
    top    of outer loop, have current $i = 1
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 0
    bottom of inner loop, have current $j = 1
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 1
    bottom of inner loop, have current $j = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 3
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 4
    bottom of outer loop, have next    $i = 2
    
    top    of outer loop, have current $i = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 0
    bottom of inner loop, have current $j = 1
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 1
    bottom of inner loop, have current $j = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 2
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 3
    top    of inner loop, have current $j = 4
    bottom of outer loop, have next    $i = 3
    
    after     outer loop, have current $i = 3
    after     outer loop, have current $j = 5

=for rperl X</noncode>

Now let's take the same nested loops, add loop labels, and replace C<next> with C<next OUTER_LOOP> instead:

    my integer $i = 0;
    my integer $j = 0;
    
    print 'before    outer loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    print 'before    outer loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";
    
    OUTER_LOOP: while ( $i < 3 ) {
        print "\n";
        print 'top    of outer loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
        $i++;
        $j = 0;
        INNER_LOOP: while ( $j < 5 ) {
            print 'top    of inner loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";
            $j++;
            if ( $j > 2 ) { next OUTER_LOOP; }
            print 'bottom of inner loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";
        }
        print 'bottom of outer loop, have next    $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after     outer loop, have current $i = ', $i, "\n";
    print 'after     outer loop, have current $j = ', $j, "\n";

This time we can see the bottom of the inner loop is only reached twice, which is the same as before.  However, now the bottom of the outer loop is never reached, because the C<next> operator is being applied to the outer loop instead of the inner loop:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before    outer loop, have current $i = 0
    before    outer loop, have current $j = 0
    
    top    of outer loop, have current $i = 0

If we replace C<next OUTER_LOOP> with C<next INNER_LOOP>, then we will see the same default behavior as when C<next> is called with no loop label.

What do you think will happen if we place C<next> with C<last> or C<redo> in these example cases?  I will leave it up to you to experiment and find out for yourself!  (Hint: C<redo INNER_LOOP> and C<redo OUTER_LOOP> will cause two different kinds of infinite loop.)

=head3 Section 2.9.5: Combining C<while> & C<STDIN>

Sometimes you want to accept multiple lines of user input via C<STDIN>, instead of just one line at a time as in previous examples.  To achieve this, we put the call to C<STDIN> inside the loop's condition:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    
    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;
    
    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator
    ## no critic qw(RequireInterpolationOfMetachars)  # USER DEFAULT 2: allow single-quoted control characters & sigils
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitExplicitStdin)  # USER DEFAULT 4: allow <STDIN> prompt
    
    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]
    
    my string $input_strings = q{};
    
    print 'Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D> on a blank line:', "\n";
    
    while ( my string $input_string = <STDIN> ) {
        $input_strings .= $input_string;
    }
    
    print "\n";
    print 'after loop, have $input_strings = ', "\n", $input_strings, "\n";

As displayed by the first C<print> operator above, the users must press the two-keystroke combination CTRL-D in order to signal the I<"EOF"> or I<"End Of File"> condition, which tells the C<while> loop to stop iterating.  Also, we must remember to include the "USER DEFAULT 4" C<no critic> command, thereby enabling use of C<STDIN>.

When we run the code above, we can see all user input has been combined into one variable C<$input_strings> via the string concatenation C<.> operator:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D> on a blank line:
    howdy
    dowdy
    doo
    
    after loop, have $input_strings = 
    howdy
    dowdy
    doo

=head2 Section 2.10: Exercises

=head3 1.  Constant Pi & Calculated Circumference Of A Circle  [ 30 mins ]

In the same F<LearningRPerl> directory from the chapter 1 exercises, create a new sub-directory named F<Chapter2>.  In the new sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_1-circumference_of_specific_radius.pl>, which contains constant data for the approximate value of pi equal to C<3.141_592_654>.  In your program, utilize the C<print> operator and RPerl's data type conversion subroutines to display your hard-coded value of pi.

Next, create a variable named C<$radius> with a value of C<12.5>, and a second variable named C<$circumference> which contains the properly-calculated circumference for a circle with the corresponding radius value.  Use C<print> and the type conversion subroutines to display all your values:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Pi = 3.141_592_654
    Radius = 12.5
    Circumference = 2 * Pi * Radius = 2 * 3.141_592_654 * 12.5 = 78.539_816_35

=for rperl X</noncode>

Run your new program by issuing the following command at your terminal command prompt:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_1-circumference_of_specific_radius.pl

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<HINT: You will need two C<no critic> commands, and your program should be at least 13 lines long.>

=head3 2.  Variable Radius & Calculated Circumference Of A Circle  [ 20 mins ]

Make a copy of your fully-functioning program from exercise 1 above, thereby creating a new RPerl program file named F<exercise_2-circumference_of_any_radius.pl>.  (Don't just edit your previous program file without making a copy, or you will not receive full credit.)

Use C<print> to prompt the user to enter a custom value for C<$radius>, then use the C<STDIN> keyword to receive one input value into a new variable named C<$radius_string> of C<string> data type.  Next, use an RPerl data type conversion subroutine to convert the C<string> data type and store it in the original C<$radius> variable of C<number> data type.

As in the previous exercise, end by using the C<print> operator to display all your values:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_2-circumference_of_any_radius.pl
    Please input radius: 3

    Pi = 3.141_592_654
    Radius = 3
    Circumference = 2 * Pi * Radius = 2 * 3.141_592_654 * 3 = 18.849_555_924

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<HINT: You will need to add a third C<no critic> command, and a total of at least 3 or 4 extra lines of code.>

=head3 3.  Conditional Error Checking & Calculated Circumference Of A Circle  [ 20 mins ]

Make a copy of your completed program from exercise 2 above, and name your new file F<exercise_3-circumference_of_any_positive_radius.pl>.

Using an C<if> and C<else> conditional statement, detect when the user provides a negative number for the radius variable, in which case a warning should be displayed and the circumference should be set to a value of zero:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_3-circumference_of_any_positive_radius.pl
    Please input radius: -3
    Negative radius detected, defaulting to zero circumference!

    Pi = 3.141_592_654
    Radius = -3
    Circumference = 2 * Pi * Radius = 2 * 3.141_592_654 * -3 = 0

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 4.  Product Of Two Numbers  [ 20 mins ]

Write a new RPerl program named F<exercise_4-product_of_any_two_numbers.pl>, which will prompt the user for two input numbers, one at a time, and then display the result of multiplying the two input numbers together.  As with all keyboard input in this and any other RPerl source code, your input values are text data and should be passed to the RPerl data type conversion subroutines before being used in numeric calculations.  Remember to reverse this by converting back from C<number> to C<string> types again, before passing a numeric value to the C<print> operator. 

An example execution of this exercise should display:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_4-product_of_any_two_numbers.pl
    Please input multiplicator: 17
    Please input multiplicand: 123.456_789

    Product = Multiplicator * Multiplicand = 17 * 123.456_789 = 2_098.765_413

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 5.  String Repetition  [ 15 mins ]

Create a new program named F<exercise_5-string_repeat.pl>, which will prompt the user for one input string followed by one input integer.  Your program should then use the string repetition operator C<x> to display the input string repeated as many times as the input integer specifies.  As always, use the RPerl data type conversion subroutines when appropriate.

An example execution should display:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_5-string_repeat.pl
    Please input string to be repeated: Repetition is an aid to memory.
    Please input integer (whole number) times to repeat string: 5

    Repetition is an aid to memory.
    Repetition is an aid to memory.
    Repetition is an aid to memory.
    Repetition is an aid to memory.
    Repetition is an aid to memory.

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 6.  Looping Integer Sum  [ 35 mins ]

Create a program named F<exercise_6-sum_of_first_n_integers.pl>, which will prompt the user for one input integer and then display the sum of the numbers 1 through the input integer, inclusive.  Utilize an C<if> conditional statement to perform an error check, and call the C<die> operator if the input integer is less-than 0.  Then utilize a C<while> loop to compute the actual sum to be displayed as a result.

Store your input integer in a variable named C<$n>, and your final result in a variable named C<$sum>, both of the C<integer> data type.  As with all loop iterators, the C<$i> variable is also an integer. 

Two possible executions of this exercise follow:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_6-sum_of_first_n_integers.pl
    Please input a positive integer: 42
    The sum of the first 42 integers is 903

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_6-sum_of_first_n_integers.pl
    Please input a positive integer: -42
    ERROR: -42 is not positive, dying

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 7.  Non-Looping Integer Sum  [ 45 mins ]

Make a copy of your completed program from the previous exercise, and save it into a new file named F<exercise_7-sum_of_first_n_integers_no_loop.pl>.

Modify the new program to remove the C<while> loop, and instead replace it with the famous method credited to Gauss, the "Prince of Mathematics":

It is said that as a child, Gauss was punished by his teacher by being told to mentally add together all the numbers from 1 to 100.  Young Gauss realized that 1 plus 100 is 101, and 2 plus 99 is also 101, as well as 3 plus 98 and so forth.  All the numbers may be paired in this manner to equal 101, and there are 50 such pairs from 1 to 100 inclusively, so the final answer is 101 multiplied by 50.  Thus, with a bit more thought Gauss was able to quickly calculate the correct answer of 5,050 and perplex his teacher in the process.

Use young Gauss' algorithm to optimize the runtime performance (AKA speed) of your new program, which you can achieve by replacing the C<while> loop with arithmetic operators as described in the story above.  This exercise should always give the same answer as the previous exercise, but Gauss' algorithm is naturally more efficient for large input integers, because it requires far fewer calculations than the repeated addition loop algorithm.

Start by assuming your input integer will be evenly divisible by two, so you can use the exact algorithm used by Gauss in the story.  Once your program works correctly for all even integer inputs, then use an C<if> conditional statement to check for odd integer inputs and extend your algorithm to handle those cases.  Of course, the error checking for negative input integers should be left in place from the previous exercise.

Two possible executions of this exercise follow, one with an even input integer, and one with an odd input integer:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_7-sum_of_first_n_integers_no_loop.pl
    Please input a positive integer: 64
    The sum of the first 64 integers = 2_080

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter2/exercise_7-sum_of_first_n_integers_no_loop.pl
    Please input a positive integer: 65
    The sum of the first 65 integers = 2_145

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<HINT: Use the modulo C<%> operator to check for odd input integers; if found, initialize a temporary variable named C<$n_odd> to the value of C<$n>, decrement C<$n> to become even, and add C<$n_odd> to your original C<$sum> result.>

=head1 CHAPTER 3: ARRAY VALUES & VARIABLES

In the previous chapter, we explored the many uses of scalar values and variables, which dealt with one number or one string at a time.  In this chapter, we will similarly explore the uses of array values and variables, which are collections of multiple scalars (numbers or strings) grouped together.

A scalar represents exactly one piece of Perl data and represents one specific data type.  An array represents zero or more pieces of Perl data and represents a compound I<"data structure">, defined as a combination of two or more subcomponents which may themselves be either normal scalar data types or additional compound data structures.  In an array, each individual subcomponent is known as an I<"element">.

In normal Perl, a variable may contain (represent) an array directly I<"by value">, or indirectly I<"by reference">.  As an analogy, imagine that your computer's memory is like a filing cabinet, your Perl program's memory is like one drawer in the filing cabinet, your array data structure is like one folder in the filing cabinet drawer, your variable is like the label on the folder, and each element of the array is like one page in the folder.

In this filing cabinet analogy, an array which is stored by value is like a normal label (array variable), on a normal folder (array data structure), containing normal pages (elements).  An array which is stored by reference is like a special label (scalar variable), affixed to a single piece of paper (scalar data type), upon which is written the location (memory address AKA reference) of a special folder (anonymous array data structure).  Inside the special folder are normal pages (elements), and there is no label (array variable) affixed to the special folder, thus we say the folder is an I<"anonymous array"> because it has no label.

To reiterate, an array stored by reference is actually a scalar variable which contains the memory address of an anonymous array.  When compared to the memory usage of storing an array by data, the memory needs of storing by reference only require one additional scalar value (one piece of paper in our filing cabinet analogy), which contains the anonymous array's memory address.  Both storing by value and storing by reference are commonly utilized in many different computer programming languages.

When an array is stored by value, the corresponding variable has an at-sign C<@> as its sigil, and the assigned data is enclosed within parentheses C<( )> characters.  When an array is stored by reference, the corresponding variable has a dollar-sign C<$> as its sigil, and the assigned data is enclosed within I<"square-bracket"> C<[ ]> characters, also known as just I<"brackets">.  If an array is stored by value and is then passed as input to an operation, it is said the array is I<"passed by value">.  On the other hand, if the array is instead stored by reference and then passed to an operation, it is said to be I<"passed by reference">.

=for comment DEV NOTE, CORRELATION #rp401: all POD changes must be made in both RPerl.pm & RPerl/Learning.pm

For arrays with more than just a few elements, it may be impractical or impossible to pass by value, because a full copy of each array element must be made in the process, which may fill up all your program's available memory or take a prohibitively long time to complete.  Also, Perl allows us to provide explicit data types only when an array is stored by reference, so we can not provide a data type for an array stored by value.  Because of these reasons, all RPerl arrays are stored by reference, and are declared with an explicit RPerl data type ending with C<_arrayref>.

    my                  @foo_by_value           = (2, 4, 6);  # fine in normal Perl, error in RPerl
    my                  $foo_by_reference       = [2, 4, 6];  # fine in normal Perl, error in RPerl
    my integer_arrayref $foo_by_reference_typed = [2, 4, 6];  # fine in normal Perl, fine  in RPerl

In a few special cases, Perl forces us to provide an array by value instead of by reference, in which case we need to I<"dereference"> our array variable, which is the process of converting from the stored-by-reference memory address to the stored-by-data values.  This is achieved by use of Perl's closefix array dereference syntax, comprised of enclosing the scalar array variable within at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }>.  Because all arrays in RPerl are stored by reference, only necessary uses of the dereference syntax are supported by the RPerl compiler.  (Please see L</Section 3.8: C<push> & C<pop> Operators> for more information on C<pop>.)

    my integer_arrayref $foo_by_reference_typed = [10, 20, 30];                    # fine in normal Perl, fine  in RPerl
    my integer          $foo_last_element       = pop @{$foo_by_reference_typed};  # fine in normal Perl, fine  in RPerl,   necessary dereference 
    my                  @foo_by_value           = @{$foo_by_reference_typed};      # fine in normal Perl, error in RPerl, unnecessary dereference

In normal Perl, a single array may contain elements with multiple different data types, such as a three-element array containing one string and one integer and one floating-point number.  In RPerl, a single array must contain elements of all the same data type, so you can have a three-element array with all strings, but you can't store an integer inside an array of strings, and likewise you can't store a string inside an array of integers, etc.

    my integer_arrayref $foo = [5, 10, 15];                 # fine
    my  number_arrayref $bar = [5, 10, 15.5];               # fine
    my  string_arrayref $bat = ['five', 'ten', 'fifteen'];  # fine

    my integer_arrayref $foo = [5, 10, 15.5];               # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    my  number_arrayref $bar = [5, 10, 'fifteen'];          # error in RPerl, compiled modes
    my  string_arrayref $bat = ['five', 'ten', 15];         # error in RPerl, compiled modes

You can create an array with only one element, sometimes called a I<"singleton">; you can even create an empty array with zero elements:

    my integer_arrayref $foo = [];    # zero elements, empty     array
    my integer_arrayref $bar = [23];  # one  element,  singleton array

To display the contents of an array, you may utilize the C<*_arrayref_to_string()> family of stringification subroutines:

    my integer_arrayref $foo;
    $foo = [23, 42, 2_112];
    print '$foo = ', integer_arrayref_to_string($foo), "\n";

Running the code example above generates the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $foo = [23, 42, 2_112]

=for rperl X</noncode>

RPerl currently supports the following array stringification subroutines, with support for all RPerl array data types coming soon:

=item * C<integer_arrayref_to_string()>

=item * C<number_arrayref_to_string()>

=item * C<string_arrayref_to_string()>

=head2 Section 3.1: Lists vs Arrays

In Perl, we use the comma C<,> character to separate elements in a C<"list">, which may then be utilized either as the operands passed as input to an appropriate operation, or as the values stored inside an array data structure.  Thus, an array variable may be assigned the value of an enclosed list, but in RPerl the reverse is not true.  (Please see L</Section 3.7: Array Assignment> for more information.)

    my                 @variable_storing_array_by_value     = ('list', 'enclosed', 'within', 'round',  'parentheses');  # fine in Perl, error in RPerl, list assigned to stored-by-value     array
    my string_arrayref $variable_storing_array_by_reference = ['list', 'enclosed', 'within', 'square', 'brackets'];     # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl, list assigned to stored-by-reference array

    my ($list, $of, $variables) = @variable_storing_array_by_value;      # fine  in Perl, error in RPerl, stored-by-value     array assigned to list
    my [$list, $of, $variables] = $variable_storing_array_by_reference;  # error in Perl, error in RPerl, stored-by-reference array assigned to list

As seen in the code example above, when a list is enclosed within square-brackets C<[ ]>, then we have a stored-by-reference I<"array literal">, which represents the literal value which may be assigned to an RPerl variable.  Likewise, when a list is enclosed within parentheses C<( )> characters and the context tells Perl the parentheses are used as array syntax, then we have a stored-by-data array literal, which may be assigned to a normal Perl variable.

Depending upon the context of the surrounding source code, the parentheses C<( )> characters have multiple different uses in Perl, including list and array literal values, explicit order-of-operations, operation input arguments, and control structure statement headers.  (Remember that RPerl only supports arrays which are stored by reference, so all RPerl array literals will be enclosed in square-brackets C<[ ]>, not parentheses C<( )>.)

    my                 @foo = (1,  3,   5);  # fine in Perl, error in RPerl, parentheses enclosing list values to create stored-by-value array
    my integer         $foo = (1 + 3) * 5;   # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl, parentheses enclosing arithmetic order-of-operations
    my string_arrayref $foo = [qw(a c e)];   # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl, parentheses enclosing input arguments to qw() operator
    if (1 < 3)         { print   'a c e'; }  # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl, parentheses enclosing if conditional statement header

Terminology can be confusing at times.  An array literal should not be confused with the similar-sounding I<"array of literals">, which is an array where all the elements are literals instead of variables or operations.  In the source code example below, the data structure C<[$foo, $bar, 23]> is an array literal, even though two of its three elements are variables themselves; remember, an array literal is any enclosed list which can be assigned to a variable.  On the other hand, the data structure C<[22,   13,   24]> below is an array of literals, because all its elements are literal values themselves.  At the same time, the variable C<$frob> can also be considered an array of literals, due to the ambiguity of the term "array" when used without explicit context.

    my integer          $foo  = 21;
    my integer          $bar  = 12;
    my integer_arrayref $quux = [$foo, $bar, 23];  # array literal     on right side  of = assignment operator
    my integer_arrayref $frob = [22,   13,   24];  # array of literals on both  sides of = assignment operator

Depending on context, the unqualified term "array" can be taken to have either the general meaning of "array data structure category", or the specific meanings "array literal" or "array assigned to variable".  The phrase "scalar versus array" should be read as "scalar data type category versus array data structure category", because we are referring to the general ideas of "scalar" and "array" instead of specific array literals or variables.  The phrase "array C<[22, 13, 24]>" should be read as "array literal C<[22, 13, 24]>", because we can see an enclosed list of comma-separated values.  The phrase "array C<$frob>" should be read as "array assigned to variable C<$frob>", because we can see a dollar-sign C<$> sigil variable name.  (This is just one of many possible confusion points caused by the linguistic subtleties inherent in our particular brand of technical terminology, often rightfully referred to as I<"programming jargon"> or even the mocking I<"techno-babble">.)  Because the stand-alone term "array" is ambiguous, the term "array of literals" can be taken to mean either "array-literal of literals" or "array-assigned-to-variable of literals".  This means we can consider both C<$frob> and C<[22, 13, 24]> to be an "array of literals" in the source code example above.  Hopefully, you will never again experience this specific confusion of jargon, but you must always be wary of subtle language issues when dealing with high-tech concepts such as programming in RPerl.

=head2 Section 3.2: 1-D Array Data Types & Constants

In RPerl, all arrays are stored by reference and have a specific data type which ends with C<_arrayref>.  In the preceeding examples, you have already seen the three most common RPerl array data types, which are C<integer_arrayref>, C<number_arrayref>, and C<string_arrayref>.

A single scalar may be considered to be a zero-dimensional (0-D) data point.  When an array's individual elements are each scalars, the array is considered to be one-dimensional (1-D), and may be visualized as multiple data points displayed on a single line.  Some additional math and software concepts related to a 1-D array or list are I<"vector">, I<"sequence">, and I<"set">; please see Wikipedia for more information.  (For example, in the MathPerl software suite, which is part of the RPerl Family of software, the C<Vector> data structure is simply a specially-packaged C<number_arrayref>.)  In some cases, it may also be useful to visualize a 1-D array as a single I<"row"> of elements.

    my integer_arrayref $row_1D = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8];  # one row on one line

The following 1-D array data types may be utilized in RPerl:

=over

=item * C<boolean_arrayref>

=item * C<unsigned_integer_arrayref>

=item * C<integer_arrayref>

=item * C<gmp_integer_arrayref>  Coming Soon

=item * C<number_arrayref>

=item * C<character_arrayref>

=item * C<string_arrayref>

=back

Perl itself does not currently support array data structures with constant values, so only scalars may be constants.

    use constant PIE  => my string $TYPED_PIE = 'pecan';  # fine in Perl & RPerl

    use constant DAYS => my string_arrayref $TYPED_DAYS = [ 'Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Weds', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat' ];  # error in Perl & RPerl

As mentioned in L</Section 2.4: Variables With Scalar Values>, future versions of RPerl will likely provide the C<scalar> data type and also the C<scalar_arrayref> data structure, which will provide the ability to use one array reference to store elements with non-matching data types.  Currently, RPerl arrays must store elements which all have the exact same data type as one another.

Please see L</Section 3.5: 2-D Array Data Types & Nested Arrays> for more RPerl array data types.

=head2 Section 3.3: How To Access Array Elements

Please take a few moments to review L</Section 2.9.1: Loop Iterator Variables> at this time.

Closely related to the loop concept of an iterator variable is that of an C<"array index">.  Each element of a Perl array is numbered, in order, by integers starting at the value of zero and counting upward.  Each such integer is known as an array index, or just I<"index"> for short.

(Depending upon context or tradition, you may argue the "i" in C<$i> stands for either "iterator" or "index".  The main difference between an iterator and an index are usage: an iterator is an integer variable used to count loop iterations; whereas an index is a integer value used to specify an array element, and may be either a variable or a hard-coded numeric literal.  An iterator can always be used as an index, and often is; however, the reverse is not true.)

What a normal person would think of as being the "first" element in an array is actually not at index value of C<1>, but is actually at index C<0> instead.  This is a common point of confusion for new programmers, or even experienced programmers who may be accustomed to a different computer language which starts at index C<1> instead of index C<0> like Perl.  It may help to think of the "first" element as actually being the "zeroth" element.

    my string_arrayref $marx_brothers = ['Chico', 'Harpo', 'Groucho', 'Gummo', 'Zeppo'];
    print 'The first born is ',   $marx_brothers->[0], "\n";
    print 'The middle child is ', $marx_brothers->[2], "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    The first born is Chico
    The middle child is Groucho

=for rperl X</noncode>

In the example above, note the "first born" is located at index value of C<0> (not C<1>), and the "middle child" is at index C<2> (not C<3>).

Also, note the thin-arrow-square-brackets C<-E<gt>[ ]> syntax for accessing the individual elements.  The thin-arrow C<-E<gt>> is Perl's I<"postfix dereference"> operation, which fetches the array data pointed to by the array's memory address, and is necessary because all RPerl arrays are stored by reference.  When combined with the postfix dereference operation, the square-brackets C<[ ]> return the actual element located at the specified index value.  In the following example, each of the three lines of source code achieves the same goal of returning the array element at index C<2>, although only the last line is valid in RPerl:

    $my_element = @my_array[2];        # fine in Perl, error in RPerl, array not stored by reference
    $my_element = @{$my_arrayref}[2];  # fine in Perl, error in RPerl, unnecessary use of @{} closefix dereference syntax
    $my_element = $my_arrayref->[2];   # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl,   necessary use of ->   postfix dereference syntax

=head2 Section 3.4: Array Length & Negative Indices

When we want to count how many elements are in an array, we need to find the array's length.  This is achieved by use of Perl's C<scalar> operator, combined with Perl's closed-fixity at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }> dereference operation.  Both the dereference and postfix dereference operations perform the same task, although they are used in differing scenarios due to their unique syntax.  The C<scalar> operator forces the dereferenced array to be evaluated in I<"scalar context">, which means Perl tries to treat an array as if it were a scalar.  Perl has many complex behaviors when forcing one data type's context upon another different data type, although in the case of forcing an array into scalar context we are simply provided with the length of the array.

    my string_arrayref $greetings        = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy'];
    my integer         $greetings_length = scalar @{$greetings};
    print 'have $greetings_length = ', $greetings_length, "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $greetings_length = 3

=for rperl X</noncode>

So, when you want to utilize an array's length to calculate a desired index value, remember that you must subtract one from the length value, because array indices start counting at zero but the array length starts counting at one.  Yes, this is another common trap for new programmers, so watch yourself!

    my string_arrayref $greetings        = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy'];
    my integer         $greetings_length = scalar @{$greetings};
    my string $greeting_final            = $greetings->[($greetings_length - 1)];
    print 'have $greeting_final = ', $greeting_final, "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $greeting_final = howdy

=for rperl X</noncode>

Now let's see what would happen if we simply forgot to subtract one:

    my string_arrayref $greetings        = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy'];
    my integer         $greetings_length = scalar @{$greetings};
    my string $greeting_final            = $greetings->[$greetings_length];
    print 'have $greeting_final = ', $greeting_final, "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Use of uninitialized value $greeting_final in print...
    have $greeting_final =

=for rperl X</noncode>

As you can see in the output above, an attempt to access the C<$greetings> element at index value C<3> results in an C<uninitialized value> error message, because the highest valid index value is actually C<2> in this case.  Don't forget to subtract one when converting from array lengths to array indices!

In Perl, an array index with a negative value will access elements beginning from index C<-1> as the final element of the array, and counting backward to end with the starting (zeroth) element.  Thus, we may rewrite the previous example to achieve the exact same result by utilizing a negative index instead of the C<scalar> operation, thereby simplifying our code by removing at least three operations and one variable:

    my string_arrayref $greetings        = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy'];
    my string $greeting_final            = $greetings->[-1];
    print 'have $greeting_final = ', $greeting_final, "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $greeting_final = howdy

=for rperl X</noncode>

If you want to access each array element in reverse order, simply count downward with indices starting at C<-1>:

    my string_arrayref $greetings        = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy'];
    print 'have $greetings->[-1] = ', $greetings->[-1], "\n";
    print 'have $greetings->[-2] = ', $greetings->[-2], "\n";
    print 'have $greetings->[-3] = ', $greetings->[-3], "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $greetings->[-1] = howdy
    have $greetings->[-2] = hi
    have $greetings->[-3] = hello

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head2 Section 3.5: 2-D Array Data Types & Nested Arrays

Because one data structure may contain another data structure as one of its subcomponents, we may thus nest multiple array values within one another.  In normal Perl, any number of arrays may be arbitrarily nested within one another in any syntactically-valid combination; in RPerl, we require the use of explicit data types, which are currently limited to 2-dimensional array-within-array data structures.  Support for 3-dimensional or other nested data structures will be added in a future version of RPerl.

    my integer_arrayref_arrayref $nested_2d =      # fine in normal Perl, fine  in RPerl, 2x3     2-D nested array
        [[0, 1, 2],
         [9, 8, 7]];
    my                           $nested_2d_mix =  # fine in normal Perl, error in RPerl, 2x3     2-D nested array, unmatching integer & string types
        [[0, 1, 2],
         ['a', 'b', 'c']];
    my                           $nested_3d =      # fine in normal Perl, error in RPerl, 3x3x3   3-D nested array, RPerl support coming soon
        [[[1, 2, 3], 
          [2, 3, 4], 
          [3, 4, 5]],
         [[9, 8, 7],
          [8, 7, 6],
          [7, 6, 5]],
         [[0, 2, 4],
          [2, 4, 6],
          [4, 6, 8]]];
    my                           $nested_4d =      # fine in normal Perl, error in RPerl, 1x1x1x3 4-D nested array, RPerl support coming soon
        [[[[23, 42, 2_112]]]];

When an array's individual elements are each arrays, and each of those arrays is comprised of scalars, then the primary array is considered to be 2-D.  ("Or not 2-D?  That is the question." ... Okay sorry for that one, haha!)  A 2-D array may be visualized as multiple data points displayed on multiple lines.  In mathematics, the concept of a I<"matrix"> is essentially a 2-D array which usually has an equal number of elements in each row.  Because of this, a matrix can often be visualized as either rectangular or square, and is said to contain both rows and I<"columns">, where the number of columns is defined as the number of elements in each row.  In the example below, the 2-D array can be utilized as a square matrix, because there are an equal number of rows (five) as there are columns (also five).

    my integer_arrayref_arrayref $rows_and_columns_2D =  # fine in RPerl, multiple rows and columns on multiple lines
        [[0, 2, 4, 6, 8],
         [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
         [4, 3, 2, 1, 0],
         [9, 8, 7, 6, 5],
         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]];

However, in RPerl we are not limited to only rectangular or square matrices, because we are not required to have the same number of elements in each row of a 2-D array.  In the example below, note the acceptable use of rows with only one or zero elements; the empty array C<[ ]> and the singleton array C<[5]> are both valid in RPerl.

    my integer_arrayref_arrayref $rows_and_columns_2D_irregular =  # fine in RPerl, irregular row lengths
        [[0, 2, 4],
         [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
         [],
         [9, 8, 7, 6],
         [5]];

The following 2-D array data types may be utilized in RPerl:

=over

=item * C<boolean_arrayref_arrayref>  Coming Soon

=item * C<unsigned_integer_arrayref_arrayref>  Coming Soon

=item * C<integer_arrayref_arrayref>

=item * C<gmp_integer_arrayref_arrayref>  Coming Soon

=item * C<number_arrayref_arrayref>

=item * C<character_arrayref_arrayref>  Coming Soon

=item * C<string_arrayref_arrayref>

=back

To access elements in a 2-D array, you must use two postfix dereference operations, which may either be combined into one statement or separated across multiple statements.  When a 2-D array is being utilized as a matrix in RPerl, then the data structure is stored in I<"row-major form">, which means the first dereference operation will give you a whole row, and the second dereference will give you an individual column element from within the selected row.

    my integer $row_3_column_0_combined = $rows_and_columns_2D->[3]->[0];  # row and column dereferences, combined in one statement
    print 'have $row_3_column_0_combined = ', $row_3_column_0_combined, "\n";

    my integer_arrayref $row_3 = $rows_and_columns_2D->[3];                # row dereference only
    print 'have $row_3 = ', integer_arrayref_to_string($row_3), "\n";
    my integer $row_3_column_0_separated = $row_3->[0];                    # column dereference only
    print 'have $row_3_column_0_separated = ', $row_3_column_0_separated, "\n";

If you run the code example above with the value of C<$rows_and_columns_2D> given in this section, then you should receive the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $row_3_column_0_combined = 9
    have $row_3 = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]
    have $row_3_column_0_separated = 9

=for rperl X</noncode>

If you want to select an entire matrix column instead of a row, then you can change the first dereference operation's index to select each row one-at-a-time, while keeping the second dereference's index set to the desired column:

    my integer_arrayref $column_3 = [];
    $column_3->[0] = $rows_and_columns_2D->[0]->[3];
    $column_3->[1] = $rows_and_columns_2D->[1]->[3];
    $column_3->[2] = $rows_and_columns_2D->[2]->[3];
    $column_3->[3] = $rows_and_columns_2D->[3]->[3];
    $column_3->[4] = $rows_and_columns_2D->[4]->[3];
    # ... and so on, for each row in $rows_and_columns_2D (if there are more than 5 rows as shown above)
    print 'have $column_3 = ', integer_arrayref_to_string($column_3), "\n";

If you run the code example above, then you should receive the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $column_3 = [6, 7, 1, 6, 5]

=for rperl X</noncode>

It is important not to confuse a 1-D array with a 2-D array which only contains one row.  A 1-D array will only require one dereference in order to access individual elements, while a 2-D array will require two dereferences to achieve the same thing.  For a 2-D array containing only one row, the first dereference should always be at index C<0> to retrieve the whole row.

    my integer_arrayref          $foo_1D =  [3, 6, 9];
    my integer_arrayref_arrayref $foo_2D = [[3, 6, 9]];

    print 'have 1-D single dereference = ', $foo_1D->[2],      "\n";
    print 'have 2-D double dereference = ', $foo_2D->[0]->[2], "\n";

Both dereference statements in the example above should access the numeric value of C<9>, taken from C<$foo_1D> and then C<$foo_2D>, respectively:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have 1-D single dereference = 9
    have 2-D double dereference = 9

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head2 Section 3.6: Quote Word C<qw()> Operator

Sometimes you will want to create an array which contains multiple string literals, which can be achieved either by normal use of quotes and commas, or by use of the I<"quote word"> operator C<qw()>.

    qw(LIST)

LIST is whitespace-separated list of string literals;

Split list elements by whitespace, return list of each element as a single-quoted string literal;

Shortcut to avoid typing single-quote C<'> and comma C<,> characters in lists of string literals;

May be utilized anywhere a list is accepted

    # the following two lines are equivalent
    qw(foo bar bat baz quux)
    'foo', 'bar', 'bat', 'baz', 'quux'

=back

Let's return to a source code example from L</Section 3.1: Lists vs Arrays>, which shows a common use of the C<qw()> operator, compared below with the equivalent code using quotes and commas:

    my string_arrayref $foo_1 = [qw(a c e)];
    my string_arrayref $bar_1 = ['a', 'c', 'e'];  # 4 characters less

In the example above, we can reduce our source code by 4 characters by utilizing the C<qw()> operator.  The benefit of using C<qw()> only increases with the number of array elements.

    my string_arrayref $foo_2 = [qw(a b c d e f g)];
    my string_arrayref $bar_2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'];  # 16 characters less
 
    my string_arrayref $foo_3 = [qw(a b c d e f g h i j k l m)];
    my string_arrayref $bar_3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm'];  # 34 characters less

Now let's take a look at the data we have stored in our array reference variables:

    print 'have $foo_1 = ', string_arrayref_to_string($foo_1), "\n";
    print 'have $bar_1 = ', string_arrayref_to_string($bar_1), "\n";
    print 'have $foo_2 = ', string_arrayref_to_string($foo_2), "\n";
    print 'have $bar_2 = ', string_arrayref_to_string($bar_2), "\n";
    print 'have $foo_3 = ', string_arrayref_to_string($foo_3), "\n";
    print 'have $bar_3 = ', string_arrayref_to_string($bar_3), "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $foo_1 = ['a', 'c', 'e']
    have $bar_1 = ['a', 'c', 'e']
    have $foo_2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
    have $bar_2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
    have $foo_3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm']
    have $bar_3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm']

=for rperl X</noncode>

As we can see in the output above, the data stored by the C<qw()> operator is identical to the data stored by the normal quotes and commas technique, and C<qw()> requires fewer characters of source code when there are at least 2 string array elements.

=head2 Section 3.7: Array Assignment

As mentioned in L</Section 3.1: Lists vs Arrays>, normal Perl allows you to perform a special kind of array assignment with multiple variables on the left (receiving) side of the equal-sign C<=> assignment operator.  This is one of Perl's countless shortcuts, allowing a software developer to initialize or modify more than one variable in a single statement.

    my ($x, $y, $z)       = @array_by_value;  # fine in Perl, error in RPerl, stored-by-value array assigned to list of scalar variables
    my ($foo, $bar, $bat) = (10, 20, 30);     # fine in Perl, error in RPerl, list                  assigned to list of scalar variables

In RPerl, we support exactly one variable on the left side of each assignment operator.  If you need to initialize or modify multiple variables, simply separate each into its own statement.  The source code below achieves the same goals as the code above, without utilizing special array assignment statements.  Each line of source code above has been expanded into three equivalent lines below.

    my integer $x = $array_by_reference->[0];  # fine in Perl, fine in RPerl, stored-by-reference array element assigned to scalar variable
    my integer $y = $array_by_reference->[1];
    my integer $z = $array_by_reference->[2];

    my integer $foo = 10;                      # fine in Perl, fine in RPerl, scalar assigned to scalar variable
    my integer $bar = 20;
    my integer $bat = 30;

=head2 Section 3.8: C<push> & C<pop> Operators

Often you will want to append one or more elements to the end of an existing array, and equally often you will want to remove one or more elements from the end of an array.  For these use cases, you may choose the C<push> and C<pop> operators.  (The end of an array is sometimes called the I<"tail"> of the array, and likewise the beginning of an array is sometimes called its I<"head">.)

The C<push> operator will add one or more new elements to the end of a dereferenced array, and will return the new array length.  The C<pop> operator will remove one element from the end of a dereferenced array, and will return the removed element.  You may optionally ignore the return value of either operator.

Both the C<push> and C<pop> operators require array arguments to be dereferenced, which means you must always use the closed-fixity at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }> array dereference operator for arrays, as demonstrated in the code examples below.

=head2 Section 3.9: C<shift> & C<unshift> Operators

In the previous section, we saw how to append and remove elements from the end of an array, using C<push> and C<pop>.  In this section, we will work with the beginning of an array instead of the end, using the C<shift> and C<unshift> operators.

The C<shift> operator will remove one element from the beginning of a dereferenced array, and will return the removed element, in the same way the C<pop> operator works on the end of an array.  The C<unshift> operator will add one or more elements to the beginning of a dereferenced array, and like C<push> will return the new array length.

Like the C<push> and C<pop> operators, both C<shift> and C<unshift> require array arguments to be dereferenced, so don't forget to use the at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }> array dereference operator every time.

Remember, if you pass value C<0> as the first argument for the range operator C<..>, whether for use as an array index or loop iterator variable or any other purpose, then you will generate a list of length 1-greater than the operator's second argument.  So, a list from C<1> to C<5> has length 5, and a list from C<0> to C<5> has length 6.  As an extension of the array-indices-start-at-zero issue, this can be a common mistake or mixup for new programmers.

=head2 Section 3.11: Converting From Array To String

The terms I<"stringify">, I<"stringification">, and I<"pretty print"> refer to type conversion from any non-string data type or data structure into a string data type.

As mentioned in this chapter's opening section L</CHAPTER 3: ARRAY VALUES & VARIABLES>, RPerl currently provides the following array stringification subroutines, with support for all RPerl array data types coming soon:

=over

=item * C<integer_arrayref_to_string()>

=item * C<number_arrayref_to_string()>

=item * C<string_arrayref_to_string()>

=back

The internals of the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine are implemented by the copied-and-pasted section of RPerl source code below, for Perl operations & Perl data types mode:

    # change this to hold your own data
    my integer_arrayref $input_avref = [8, 23, 17];

    # [ BEGIN COPIED-AND-PASTED CODE ]

    # declare local variables, av & sv mean "array value" & "scalar value" as used in Perl core
    my integer $input_av_length;
    my integer $input_av_element;
    my string $output_sv;
    my boolean $i_is_0 = 1;

    # compute length of (number of elements in) input array
    $input_av_length = scalar @{$input_avref};

    # begin output string with left-square-bracket, as required for all RPerl arrays
    $output_sv = '[';

    # loop through all valid values of $i for use as index to input array
    for my integer $i ( 0 .. ( $input_av_length - 1 ) ) {
        # retrieve input array's element at index $i
        $input_av_element = $input_avref->[$i];

        # append comma & space to output string for all elements except index 0
        if ($i_is_0) { $i_is_0 = 0; }
        else         { $output_sv .= ', '; }

        # stringify individual integer element, append to output string
        $output_sv .= integer_to_string($input_av_element);
    }

    # end output string with right-square-bracket, as required for all RPerl arrays
    $output_sv .= ']';

    # [ END COPIED-AND-PASTED CODE ]

    # display stringified output
    print $output_sv;

In the RPerl system source code above, you will see at least 1 new concept: the usage of a C<for> loop.

The input to this source code is an C<integer_arrayref> accessed via the variable C<$input_avref>, and the output generated is a string in the variable C<$output_sv>.  (The term "avref" refers to "Array Value Reference", and likewise "sv" refers to "Scalar Value"; these terms are used in the internals of the Perl 5 interpreter itself, and copied in RPerl's internals for consistency.) 

The C<for> loop is used to access each individual element of the input array, one at a time; each element is then, in turn, stringified and appended to the output string.  You will note the C<integer_to_string()> stringification subroutine is called from within the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine, which makes sense because an C<integer_arrayref> data structure is obviously composed of individual C<integer> data types.

Running the code example above generates the following output string from C<$output_sv>, which is an exact replica of the original RPerl C<integer_arrayref> input data from C<$input_avref>:

(Please see L</Section 4.5.1: C<my> Intermittent Variables> for the full subroutine C<integer_arrayref_to_string()>.)

=head2 Section 3.12: Program Control Using The C<for> & C<foreach> Loops

In the previous section, you saw a C<for> loop control structure used to stringify an array in the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine.  In this section, we'll learn more about the C<for> loop and its closely-related counterpart, the C<foreach> loop.

Please take a few minutes to review L</Section 2.9: Program Control Using The C<while> Loop> if you have not yet done so; this should prove helpful because the C<for> and C<foreach> loops share some things in common with the C<while> loop control structure.  When compared with the much more loosely-structured C<while> loop, the RPerl compiler may have more opportunities to perform automatic optimizations on C<for> and C<foreach> loop control structures.  Unlike loop iterator variables in a C<while> loop, iterators in a C<for> or C<foreach> loop should only be modified in the loop header, in order to avoid hard-to-diagnose behavior and also to increase the opportunities for automatic optimization.

=item * I<When possible, always use a C<for> or C<foreach> loop instead of a C<while> loop.>

=item * I<In a C<for> or C<foreach> loop, never modify the loop iterator variable inside the loop body, only inside the loop header.>

=back

=for html </u>

In normal Perl, there is no difference whatsoever between the C<for> and C<foreach> loops; the 2 keywords are synonymous and you may freely interchange them as you like.  This follows the Perl philosophy of TIMTOWTDI (There Is More Than One Way To Do It).

In RPerl, the C<for> and C<foreach> loops are used for separate, but related, purposes.  This follows the RPerl philosophies of TDNNTBMTOWTDI (There Does Not Need To Be More Than One Way To Do It) and TIOFWTDI (There Is One Fastest Way To Do It).

In RPerl, the C<for> loop itself is actually 2 different control structures: the I<"range"> C<for> loop and the I<"C-style"> C<for> loop.  The range C<for> loop is so named due to its use of the range operator C<..>, which you may recall from L</Section 3.10: Range C<..> Operator>.  The C-style C<for> loop derives its name from its origins in the foundational programming language I<"C">, which is the language used to build most modern technology such as Linux and Perl and RPerl.  (Of course we prefer programming in Perl over C, so that's why we created RPerl in the first place, because RPerl generates the C and C++ code for us!)

=head3 Section 3.12.1: The Range C<for> Loop

Often you will want your loop iterator variable to simply increase by one each time the loop iterates, starting and ending at some specific values.  For this purpose, you may choose the range C<for> loop control structure.

    for my integer $i ( 1 .. 5 ) {
        print 'have $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $i = 1
    have $i = 2
    have $i = 3
    have $i = 4
    have $i = 5

=for rperl X</noncode>

Range C<for> loop control structures always take the following form:

    for my integer $i ( $lower .. $upper ) {
        # PERFORM OPERATIONS INSIDE LOOP
    }

In the source code example above, C<$i> is the loop iterator variable, which you will hopefully recall from L</Section 2.9.1: Loop Iterator Variables>.  By definition, a loop iterator variable must always be a variable, although it may be named something other than C<$i> if you like.  The C<$lower> and C<$upper> variables are the two operands to the infix range operator C<..>, and they may be any expression, literal, or variable which produces a numeric value.  The number of times this loop will iterate is C<($upper - $lower) + 1>, and each time the loop iterates it will effectively cause the value of C<$i> to increase by one, starting at C<$lower> and ending at C<$upper>.

In all range C<for> loops, the iterator variable (C<$i> in this example) is I<"lexically scoped"> by virtue of Perl's C<my> keyword, which means this specific instance of C<$i> is valid within this specific loop header and body only.  Any other independent loop(s) within the same Perl program may also utilize an iterator variable with the exact same name C<$i>, but it will be a totally new instance of C<$i>, and thus will not be connected in any way other than the coincidence of sharing an iterator variable name.  Also, once you utilize a variable name as a loop iterator, then you must not declare or utilize that same variable name except within other independent loops (as just described), or within a totally different scope such as a different source code file, etc.  Failure to do so will result in a C++ compile-time error, as illustrated in the next two source code examples.

The following example shows multiple instances of the loop iterator variable C<$i>, without any errors:

    for my integer $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        # do stuff inside first loop, using $i; fine
    }

    # do stuff outside loops, not using $i; fine
    my integer $x = 100;

    # fine
    for my integer $i ( 20 .. 30 ) {
        # do stuff inside second loop,
        # using totally independent instance of $i
    }

The following example shows multiple instances of the loop iterator variable C<$i>, with an error:

    for my integer $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        # do stuff inside first loop, using $i; fine
    }

    # do stuff outside loops, using $i; causes error in second loop below
    my integer $i = 100;

    # ERROR ECOGEASCP012, CODE GENERATOR, ABSTRACT SYNTAX TO C++: 
    # variable i already declared in this scope, namespace main::, subroutine/method main(), dying
    for my integer $i ( 20 .. 30 ) {
        # do stuff inside second loop,
        # using totally independent instance of $i
    }

We have recently seen the range C<for> loop in L</Section 3.11: Converting From Array To String>, used inside the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine.  Here is the header and first operation of that same range C<for> loop, isolated from the rest of the code:

    # loop through all valid values of $i for use as index to input array
    for my integer $i ( 0 .. ( $input_av_length - 1 ) ) {
        # retrieve input array's element at index $i
        $input_av_element = $input_avref->[$i];

        # PERFORM OPERATIONS USING $input_av_element
    }

In the source code example above, the range operator C<..> begins at C<0> and ends at C<( $input_av_length - 1 )>; remember, array indices start at 0, so we must always be careful to subtract one from the array's length when calculating the range operator's second operand.  (If you forget to subtract one from the second operand, then your code will probably attempt to access one element beyond the end of the array, which generally causes errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior.)  Inside the loop body, we access the element of array C<$input_avref> located at index C<$i>, and store the element inside the C<$input_av_element> variable for further use in the loop (not shown).  This loop will access each and every element of the array, in order, one at a time.

=head3 Section 3.12.2: The C-Style C<for> Loop

Sometimes you need more control over your loop iterator variable than the range C<for> loop can provide; for this, you may choose the C-style C<for> loop.  However, the additional complexity of C-style C<for> loop control structures may result in fewer opportunities for the RPerl compiler to perform automatic optimizations when compared with range C<for> loops.

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=item * I<When possible, always use a range C<for> loop instead of a C-style C<for> loop.>

=back

=for html </u>

In the range C<for> loop, there is one operation in the loop header, which is the range operator C<..>.  In the C-style C<for> loop header, there are three operations which all pertain to the loop iterator variable, separated by semicolon C<;> characters: initialization, continuation condition, and incrementation.  The initialization operation is an integer variable declaration which is only executed once, before the very first loop iteration.  The continuation condition operation is an inequality operator which is evaluated for boolean truth value before each loop iteration, and the loop will continue iterating as long as the condition evaluates to true.  The incrementation operation is generally an arithmetic incrementation operator which executes once at the end of every loop iteration.

All RPerl source code files which utilize a C-style C<for> loop must also include a specific C<## no critic qw(ProhibitCStyleForLoops)> directive to avoid triggering an RPerl syntax error.

    ## no critic qw(ProhibitCStyleForLoops)
    for ( my integer $i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++ ) {
        print 'have $i = ', $i, "\n";
    }

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $i = 1
    have $i = 2
    have $i = 3
    have $i = 4
    have $i = 5

=for rperl X</noncode>

In the source code example above, the initialization operation is C<my integer $i = 1>, which achieves the same outcome as the C<for my integer $i> and C<1 ..> components in the previous section's range C<for> loop header.  The continuation condition is C<$i E<lt>= 5>, which is equivalent to the range C<for> loop header's C<.. 5> component.  Finally, the incrementation operation is C<$i++>, which equivalent to the implied increment-by-one of the range operator C<..> itself.

C-style C<for> loop control structures always take the following form:

    ## no critic qw(ProhibitCStyleForLoops)
    for ( my integer $i = $lower; $i <= $upper; $i++ ) {
        # PERFORM OPERATIONS INSIDE LOOP
    }

In the source code example above, C<$i> is the loop iterator variable, which you may name something other than C<$i>, as with the range C<for> loop.  The C<$lower> and C<$upper> variables may be any expression, literal, or variable which produces a numeric value.  The less-or-equal C<E<lt>=> operator may be any comparison operator; if less-or-equal is used as shown in this example, then the number of times this loop will iterate is C<($upper - $lower) + 1>, again matching the behavior of the simpler range C<for> loop control structure.  The C<$i++> auto-increment operator may be any operation, although the obvious goal should be to increment or modify the loop iterator variable in some way.  As with the range C<for> loop example in the previous section, each time this loop iterates it will cause the value of C<$i> to increase by one, starting at C<$lower> and ending at C<$upper>.

As with range C<for> loops, all C-style C<for> loops have lexically scoped iterator variables.  If you attempt to utilize a loop iterator variable outside of a loop, you will likely experience a C++ compile-time error.

Let's return again to our example from the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine, now converted to a C-style C<for> loop:

    ## no critic qw(ProhibitCStyleForLoops)
    # loop through all valid values of $i for use as index to input array
    for ( my integer $i = 0; $i < $input_av_length; $i++ ) {
        # retrieve input array's element at index $i
        $input_av_element = $input_avref->[$i];

        # PERFORM OPERATIONS USING $input_av_element
    }

In this modified source code example, the loop header's initialization operation is C<my integer $i = 0>.  The continuation condition has been simplified and optimized by removing the subtract-one C<- 1> operation and utilizing a less-than C<E<lt>> operator instead of a less-or-equal C<E<lt>=> operator.  (RPerl is usually capable of automatically performing this specific optimization on the range operator's second operand in range C<for> loops, where applicable.)  The incrementation operation is a simple C<$i++> auto-increment operator which increases the value of iterator variable by one after each loop iteration.  The loop body remains unchanged, and we can access the elements of array C<$input_avref> in the exact same manner as in the original example.  This C-style C<for> loop will access each element of the array in order, and is functionally equivalent to the original range C<for> loop.

=head3 Section 3.12.3: The C<foreach> Loop

Sometimes you do not need a loop iterator variable at all, and instead you just need to access each element of an array in order; for this, you may choose the C<foreach> loop control structure.  By utilizing a C<foreach> loop, you can rest assured that no code inside your loop body will cause problems by modifying your iterator variable, because there is no iterator to begin with!

=for html <u>

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=over

=item * I<When possible, always use a C<foreach> loop instead of a C<for> or C<while> loop.>

=back

=for html </u>

In the range C<for> loop header there is one operation; in the C-style C<for> loop header there are three operations; and in the C<foreach> loop header there is one operation, the element variable declaration, followed by a list of elements.

Because the C<foreach> loop has no iterator variable, we can skip directly to initializing the variable which will store each loop iteration's respective element, and this now occurs in the loop header instead of inside the loop body.  The list of elements in a C<foreach> loop header is where we get the individual elements accessible during each loop iteration.

    foreach my string $element ( 'smile', 'frown', 'blank stare', 'wince', 'pucker' ) {
        print 'have $element = ', $element, "\n";
    }

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $element = smile
    have $element = frown
    have $element = blank stare
    have $element = wince
    have $element = pucker

=for rperl X</noncode>

In the source code example above, the declaration operation is C<my string $element>, followed by the element list containing three string literals which describe common facial expressions.

C<foreach> loop control structures always take the following form:

    foreach my string $element ( 'first', 'second', 'third' ) {
        # PERFORM OPERATIONS INSIDE LOOP
    }

In the source code example above, C<$element> is the loop element variable of data type C<string>, which you may name something other than C<$element> and give any data type as appropriate.  The list elements C<'first', 'second', 'third'> may be any expression(s), literal(s), or variable(s) which produce a valid list.  It is also quite common to utilize the at-sign-curly-braces array dereference operator C<@{ }> within the loop header's parentheses, in order to load list elements from within a pre-existing array variable (as seen in the next example below).  The number of times this loop will execute is equal to the number of elements in the list, which is three in the current example.

As with the iterator variables in C<for> loops, all the element variables in C<foreach> loops are lexically scoped.  If you attempt to utilize a loop element variable outside of a loop, you will likely experience a C++ compile-time error.

Let's return once more to our example from the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine, now finally converted to a C<foreach> loop:

    # loop through all valid elements in input array
    foreach my integer $input_av_element ( @{$input_avref} ) {
        # PERFORM OPERATIONS USING $input_av_element
    }

In this re-modified source code example, the loop header's declaration operation is C<my integer $input_av_element>.  The list elements are taken directly from the C<$input_avref> variable by use of the array dereference operator C<@{ }>.  The loop iterator variable is completely removed, as are the range operator, the continuation condition inequality operator (including subtract-one operation), and the incrementation operator in the loop header, as well as the array element retrieval operation inside the loop body.  The resulting code is significantly simpler, cleaner, and less error-prone than before.

=head2 Section 3.13: Punctuation Variables & Magic

In normal Perl, you may access and modify a number of I<"punctuation variables"> AKA I<"special variables">, which are created by the Perl language itself and may be utilized to achieve many different goals.  Perl punctuation variables derive their collective name from their sometimes-cryptic combinations of punctuation characters, such as the dollar-sign C<$>, at-sign C<@>, percent-sign C<%>, underscore C<_>, and exclamation-point C<!> characters.

A semi-random (and relatively tiny) selection of Perl's numerous punctuation variables follows:

=over

=item * C<$_> AKA C<$ARG>

=item * C<@_> AKA C<@ARG>

=item * C<$!> AKA C<$OS_ERROR> AKA C<$ERRNO>

=item * C<%!> AKA C<%OS_ERROR> AKA C<%ERRNO>

=item * C<$$> AKA C<$PROCESS_ID> AKA C<$PID>

=back

In the list above, the left-most item on each line is the punctuation form of each punctuation variable, followed by the plain-English equivalent(s).  Out of all these (and the many other unlisted) punctuation variables, only C<@ARG> is utilized in RPerl, and then only in the plain-English format, never the C<@_> punctuation format.  Please see L</CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZING BY SUBROUTINES> for more information on the C<@ARG> special variable.

Practically all of the punctuation variables' functionality is based on Perl's high-magic software components.  You may recall the mention of Perl's magic in the following sections:

=over

=item * L</Section 1.10: Why Didn't Will Just Use Normal Perl?>

"The most complex and flexible parts of Perl are called I<"high magic">, so RPerl is focused on supporting the I<"low magic"> parts of Perl which can be made to run fast."

=item * L</Section 1.15: What Is RPerl Not Meant To Do?>

"If you have purposefully designed your Perl software to depend on these high-magic features, or you are unconditionally committed to continue using high-magic language features, then maybe RPerl isn't for you."

=item * L</Section 1.25.4: The Low-Magic Perl Commandments>

"The high-magic features of Perl are primarily responsible for the slow speed at which Perl executes general-purpose computations."

=back

The Low-Magic Perl Commandments (LMPCs) put an even finer point on it:

=over

=item * L<The 11th Low-Magic Perl Commandment|http://rperl.org/the_low_magic_perl_commandments.html#commandments_magic>

"11. Thou Shalt Not Use ... High-Magic Perl"

=item * L<The 23rd Low-Magic Perl Commandment|http://rperl.org/the_low_magic_perl_commandments.html#commandments_data>

"23. Thou Shalt Not Use ... Punctuation Variables"

=back

In keeping with the 23rd LMPC, RPerl does not support the use of punctuation variables.

Further, in keeping with the 11th LMPC, RPerl does not support the use of any high-magic Perl features, which is the basis of RPerl's ability to produce super-high-speed output.  Future versions of RPerl may include support for medium-magic Perl features, and perhaps even high-magic features some day, but the default RPerl compile mode will always be based on the low-magic RPerl grammar, which generates the most high-performance output code possible.

Please review all of L<The Low-Magic Perl Commandments|http://rperl.org/the_low_magic_perl_commandments.html> for more information about which Perl features are high-magic and which are low-magic.

=head2 Section 3.14: C<reverse> Operator

Sometimes you will want to reverse the order in which a list or array's elements are stored, whereby the last element becomes first, and vice-versa.  For this purpose, you may choose the C<reverse> operator.

Like C<push> & C<pop> & friends, the C<reverse> operator requires array arguments to be dereferenced, so don't forget to use the closed-fixity at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }> array dereference operator where appropriate.

=head2 Section 3.16: Scalar & Array Contexts

In normal Perl, usually there is no explicit indication of the data type of an expression's return value; in other words, normal Perl code doesn't know ahead of time if any particular expression will return a string or an integer or an array, etc.  RPerl solves this issue once-and-for-all by providing a fully-fledged data type system, as you have been learning about throughout this book.

Normal Perl attempts to approach this issue through a few different mechanisms, one of which is I<"context">, meaning the requirements or expectations of the receiving operation.  In other words, Perl tries to guess what kind of data you want, and may even change your data without telling you, based on the requirements of your own code.  In this section we will consider scalar context, and how it relates to array context (AKA list context).

All three lines of code in the following example enforce scalar context on the right-hand-side of the equal-sign C<=>, because the receiving operation on the left-hand-side is a scalar (integer) variable modification and thus requires a scalar value as input:

    my integer $i =                   3;  # scalar variable receiving scalar value, context    match, fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl
    my integer $j = scalar @{[2, 4, 6]};  # scalar variable receiving scalar value, context    match, fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl
    my integer $k =        @{[2, 4, 6]};  # scalar variable receiving array  value, context mismatch, fine in Perl, error in RPerl compiled modes
    print 'have $i = ', $i, "\n";
    print 'have $j = ', $j, "\n";
    print 'have $k = ', $k, "\n";

When executing the source code above in non-compiled mode, the following output is generated:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $i = 3
    have $j = 3
    have $k = 3

=for rperl X</noncode>

However, when we try to compile the source code, we experience an error:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    ERROR ECOGEASCP871, CODE GENERATOR, ABSTRACT SYNTAX TO C++: Array dereference of array reference must provide data type for array reference in CPPOPS_CPPTYPES mode, but no data type provided, dying

=for rperl X</noncode>

In non-compiled mode, the normal Perl interpreter will detect the context mismatch and force an implicit context switch from the array C<@{[2, 4, 6]}> to the scalar C<$k>.  This same array-to-scalar context switch is achieved explicitly via the C<scalar> operator.  Both implicit and explicit context switches have the same effect, an array value put into scalar context will simply return the number of array elements.

The ability for Perl to guess and imply context is derived from high-magic features.  Once again, the Low-Magic Perl Commandments are clear on the issue:

=over

=item * L<The 57th Low-Magic Perl Commandment|http://rperl.org/the_low_magic_perl_commandments.html#commandments_operations>

"57. Thou Shalt Not Use Scalar Operations In List Context & Vice-Versa"

=back

In keeping with the 57th LMPC, RPerl does not support the use of implied or mismatched context.

When you need to force an array or list into scalar context, which is the same as asking for an element count, then simply utilize the C<scalar> operator as demonstrated above.  Do not try to force a scalar into an array context, it makes no sense in RPerl and will only produce errors in your code.

=head2 Section 3.17: C<STDIN> & Arrays

When we combine a C<while> loop control structure with the C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> input data stream, then the C<while> loop is able to detect a special signal from the operating system, known as I<"End-Of-Transmission"> (EOT) or I<"End-Of-File"> (EOF), which tells the loop there is no more user input available.  The EOF condition is triggered when a user presses the <CTRL-D> key combination on their keyboard.

Data collected from C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> is always of the C<string> data type, and each collected line always contains an extra newline C<"\n"> character at the end, due to the user pressing the <ENTER> key after each line.  (If the user presses only <CTRL-D> and not <ENTER> after the last line of input, then the extra newline character will be missing on the last line collected.)  We can use the safe C<chomp> operator to remove any trailing newline(s) characters if present, and push each collected line of input onto an array:

    my string_arrayref $input_strings = [];
    print 'Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:', "\n";
    while (my string $input_string = <STDIN>) {
        chomp $input_string;
        push @{$input_strings}, $input_string;
    }
    print "\n";
    print 'have $input_strings = ', string_arrayref_to_string($input_strings), "\n";

When we run the source code example above, we will be prompted for input until we signal EOF:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:
    alpha
    beta
    gamma
    delta
    epsilon

    have $input_strings = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta', 'epsilon']

=for rperl X</noncode>

If we press <CTRL-D> immediately, then no input is collected and we have an empty array, zero elements:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:

    have $input_strings = []

=for rperl X</noncode>

If we press <ENTER> once before pressing <CTRL-D>, then a blank line of input is collected and we have an array with one element, an empty string:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:


    have $input_strings = ['']

=for rperl X</noncode>

If you want to accept only a certain number of input lines, instead of allowing the user to end input with <CTRL-D>, then one option would be to replace the C<while> loop with a C<for> loop instead.  This is left as an exercise for the reader.

=head2 Section 3.18: Exercises

=head3 1.  Reverse Collected Array Of Strings  [ 30 mins ]

In the same F<LearningRPerl> directory from the chapter 1 & 2 exercises, create a new sub-directory named F<Chapter3>.  In the new sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_1-stdin_strings_reverse.pl>.

Use a C<while> loop to collect data from C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> until the user signals EOF, storing the collected strings in an array variable named C<$input_strings>.  Use the C<reverse> operator and store the new data in a different array variable named C<$input_strings_reversed>.  Finally, use a C<foreach> loop to print all the elements in reverse order, one-at-a-time.  (Do not use the C<string_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine.)

Your program should produce exactly the following output, when provided with the first seven letters of the alphabet as input:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter3/exercise_1-stdin_strings_reverse.pl 
    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:
    a
    b
    c
    d
    e
    f
    g

    Strings in reverse order:
    g
    f
    e
    d
    c
    b
    a

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 2.  Collect Array Indices  [ 45 mins ]

Use the C<qw()> operator to store the following list of words in an array variable named C<$flintstones_and_rubbles>, in exactly this order:

=over

=item * fred

=item * betty

=item * barney

=item * dino

=item * wilma

=item * pebbles

=item * bamm-bamm

=back

Next, use a C<while> loop to collect data from C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> until the user signals EOF, converting the collected strings to integers and storing them in an array variable named C<$input_indices>.  

Finally, use a C<foreach> loop to print all the elements of C<$flintstones_and_rubbles> which correspond to the collected user input array indices, with the caveat that we do not expect the user to know array indices begin at zero, so the element C<fred> is displayed by user input C<1> instead of C<0>.

Your program should produce exactly the following output, when provided with the first four odd integers as input:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter3/exercise_2-stdin_array_indices.pl 
    Please input zero or more integers with values ranging from 1 to 7, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:
    1
    3
    5
    7

    Flintstones & Rubbles:
    fred
    barney
    wilma
    bamm-bamm

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 3.  Sort & Display Collected Array Of Strings  [ 45 mins ]

Create a constant boolean value named C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT>, and set it to C<0>.

Next, use a C<while> loop to collect data from C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> until the user signals EOF, storing the collected strings in an array variable named C<$input_strings>.  Use the C<sort> operator and store the new data in a different array variable named C<$input_strings_sorted>.

Finally, use a C<foreach> loop containing a nested C<if> statement and C<chomp> operator, in order to print all the elements in sorted order.  If the value of C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT> is true, separate the elements by one space and display all on one line of output; otherwise, display each element on a new line of output.

Your program should produce exactly the output below, when C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT> is set to C<0> and the following strings are provided as input:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter3/exercise_3-stdin_strings_sort.pl 
    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:
    gygax
    grue
    gorn
    galactus
    galadriel

    Strings in ASCIIbetical order:
    galactus
    galadriel
    gorn
    grue
    gygax

=for rperl X</noncode>

Now, set the value of C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT> to C<1> and you should see the following:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter3/exercise_3-stdin_strings_sort.pl 
    Please input zero or more strings, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:
    gygax
    grue
    gorn
    galactus
    galadriel

    Strings in ASCIIbetical order:
    galactus galadriel gorn grue gygax

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head1 CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZING BY SUBROUTINES

As we have seen in the preceding chapters, Perl is an operator-rich language, meaning there are a relatively large number of built-in operators available to Perl programmers.  However, sometimes you will want to create your own user-defined operation, which may be utilized like a built-in operator and which provides some custom functionality that's not already available.  In these cases, you may create a new I<"subroutine">.

As you may have expected, our first subroutine example will be our old favorite, "Hello, World!", implemented in RPerl:

    our void $hello_world = sub {
        print 'Hello, World!', "\n";
    };

In the source code example above, we have defined a very simple subroutine named C<hello_world()>, which may be called as follows:

    hello_world();

When called, this subroutine simply prints the output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World!

=for rperl X</noncode>

Now let's dissect the above source code example into its individual components:

First, we see the keyword C<our>, which is used in normal Perl to denote a global variable, and is used in RPerl for only a few specific purposes, most commonly to begin the definition of a subroutine.  (We have already utilized the C<our> keyword to declare the C<$VERSION> variable in the header section of an RPerl program.)  The definitions of all RPerl subroutines begin with the C<our> keyword.

Second, we see the C<void> data type, which provides the I<"return type"> of the subroutine.  All RPerl subroutines must specify exactly one return type, which is the data type of the value returned when the subroutine is finished running.  A return type of C<void> means this subroutine does not actually return any data whatsoever, which makes sense because all we have is a single C<print> statement inside the subroutine, and generally the C<print> statement is not considered to be an operator which returns a (useful) value.  Normal Perl does not provide a type system, and thus can not provide the ability to specify subroutine return types; this is only possible in RPerl.

Third, we see the variable name C<$hello_world>, which provides the name of the subroutine.  The definition of an RPerl subroutine is the only place where you will include a dollar-sign C<$> as part of the subroutine name; everywhere else in your source code you will refer to the subroutine without the dollar-sign C<$> prefix and with an added parentheses C<( )> suffix, so our example becomes C<hello_world()> throughout the rest of your code.  In normal Perl, a subroutine name is very rarely defined with a dollar-sign C<$> prefix - this is a bit of tricky magic (oh no!) used internally by RPerl in order to enable subroutine return types.  Because a special subroutine reference value is stored in the global scalar variable named C<$hello_world>, you may not create a normal variable with the same name C<$hello_world> in the main operations section of your RPerl program.  However, you are free to create scalar variables named C<$hello_world> within this or any other subroutine.

After the RPerl subroutine name, we will always see an equal-sign C<=> followed by the C<sub> keyword and a left-curly-brace C<{> character.  As usual, the equal-sign C<=> is the assignment operator, which assigns the special subroutine reference value to the global scalar variable C<$hello_world>.  Both RPerl and normal Perl use the C<sub> keyword to define a subroutine, as well as the left-curly-brace C<{> to denote the beginning of the subroutine's body.

Following the left-curly-brace C<{> character is the subroutine's body, which is a code block consisting of an arbitrary number of operations, and is generally the same in both RPerl and normal Perl.  In the example above, the body consists of exactly one operation, the C<print 'Hello, World!', "\n";> statement.

Finally, we see a right-curly-brace C<}> followed by a semicolon C<;> character, used to denote the end of the subroutine's body.  In normal Perl, there is no trailing semicolon C<;> used after the right-curly-brace C<}> character.

=head2 Section 4.1: Subroutine Definitions

In software development, we have the two related concepts of I<"subroutine declaration"> and I<"subroutine definition">.  To declare a subroutine, a software developer must provide (at least) the subroutine's name and return type.  To define a subroutine, a developer must provide at least the subroutine's name and body.  In RPerl, these two steps of declaration and definition are always combined into one single step, where we provide the subroutine's name and return type and body all together, as seen in the "Hello, World!" example in the previous section.

Normal Perl does not provide the ability to specificy a subroutine's return type, so the closest thing to the separation of subroutine declaration and definition in normal Perl is the usage of high-magic features such as the manipulation of subroutine references, etc.  In the C and C++ programming languages, subroutine declarations and definitions are traditionally kept separate, often in completely different source code files.

Because RPerl subroutine declarations and definitions are always combined, we will simply use the term "subroutine definition" in this textbook.

RPerl subroutines with very short bodies may be written on a single line, so we can re-write the "Hello, World!" subroutine as a one-liner by simply deleting the two invisible newline characters:

    our void $hello_world = sub { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; };

In normal Perl, the same subroutine would be written like this:

    sub hello_world { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; }

Let's compare them more closely:

         sub  hello_world       { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; }   #  Perl
    our void $hello_world = sub { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; };  # RPerl

In the comparison above, we can quickly see the different placements of the C<sub> keyword and RPerl's usage of the C<void> return type.  We can also easily point out the four additional bits of RPerl syntax not present in the normal Perl line: C<our>, C<$>, C<=>, and C<;>.

In both RPerl and normal Perl, the capitalization of variables (and thus RPerl subroutine names) is significant, which is to say that subroutine names are case-sensitive.  The subroutine name C<hello_world()> is different than either C<Hello_World()> or C<HELLO_world()>, all of which are valid Perl (and RPerl) subroutine names.  As detailed in L</Section 2.5: Constant Data>, the all-uppercase subroutine name C<HELLO_WORLD()> is reserved for constant use only, as is any other all-uppercase subroutine or variable name in RPerl.

    our void $hello_world = sub { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; };
    our void $Hello_World = sub { print 'Hello, World, again!', "\n"; };
    our void $HELLO_world = sub { print 'Hello, World, yet again!', "\n"; };

We can call these three similarly-named-yet-distinct subroutines as follows:

    hello_world();
    Hello_World();
    HELLO_world();

Doing so will print three different lines of output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Hello, World!
    Hello, World, again!
    Hello, World, yet again!

=for rperl X</noncode>

If we try to define a subroutine with an all-uppercase name, RPerl will give an error due to all-uppercase symbols being reserved for constants:

    our void $HELLO_WORLD = sub { print 'Hello, World!', "\n"; };

Before we can even try to call this C<HELLO_WORLD()> subroutine, RPerl tells us we have made a mistake because an all-uppercase symbol is not a valid variable symbol (and thus not a valid RPerl subroutine name):

=for rperl X<noncode>

    ERROR ECOPARP00, RPERL PARSER, RPERL SYNTAX ERROR
    Failed RPerl grammar syntax check with the following information:
    
        File Name:         ...
        Line Number:       ...
        Unexpected Token:  $HELLO_WORLD
        Expected Token(s): VARIABLE_SYMBOL

=for rperl X</noncode>

As long as you are careful to use proper capitalization, then you are free to utilize all-uppercase constant names such as C<PIE()> alongside not-all-uppercase subroutine names:

         sub  sweet_tooth       { print 'Yum!  I love ', PIE(), ' pie.', "\n"; }   #   usable in Perl, error  in RPerl
    our void $SWEET_TOOTH = sub { print 'Yum!  I love ', PIE(), ' pie.', "\n"; };  # unusable in Perl, error  in RPerl
    our void $Sweet_Tooth = sub { print 'Yum!  I love ', PIE(), ' pie.', "\n"; };  # unusable in Perl, usable in RPerl
    our void $sweet_tooth = sub { print 'Yum!  I love ', PIE(), ' pie.', "\n"; };  # unusable in Perl, best   in RPerl

In the C<sweet_tooth()> example above, the first line is usable only in normal Perl, the second line is not usable at all, and both the third and fourth lines are usable only in RPerl.  Please see L</Section 2.4.1: How To Select Expressive Variable Names> for best practices which apply equally to subroutine names as well as variable names.  The fourth line fulfills best practices by naming the subroutine using all-lowercase letters.

=head2 Section 4.2: Subroutine Calls

As seen in the previous two sections, in order to run a subroutine we must call (AKA I<"invoke">) the subroutine by name.  This is achieved by simply typing the subroutine's name, without the dollar-sign C<$> prefix, and adding empty parentheses C<( )> as a suffix.  As with all Perl expressions, we end with a semicolon C<;> character.  In this way, we can call the best practices version of the "sweet tooth" example from the previous section:

    sweet_tooth();

Utilizing the original constant value from L</Section 2.5: Constant Data>, invoking the subroutine will return the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Yum!  I love pecan pie.

=for rperl X</noncode>

Remember, as mentioned in the previous section, all subroutine names are case-sensitive and must be spelled exactly the same for every subroutine call.  In the following five subroutine calls, only the first line is a valid call because the rest are all misspelled:

    sweet_tooth();  # fine
    sweeT_tootH();  # error
    swEEt_tooth();  # error
    sweet_tOOth();  # error
    sw33t_t00th();  # error

=head3 Section 4.2.1: Parentheses Suffix & Ampersand Sigil Prefix

In RPerl, all subroutine calls must include parentheses C<( )> as a suffix immediately following the name of the subroutine, with no space between the last letter of the name and the left-parenthesis C<(> character.  In normal Perl, you are allowed to have whitespace between the subroutine name and the parentheses characters, although this is both unnecessary and potentially quite confusing, thus it is against best practices.  Likewise, it is not an error to include optional whitespace between the left-parenthesis C<(> and right-parenthesis C<)> characters, but again, best practices admonish us to allow no extraneous whitespace between the parentheses.

=for html <u>

I<BEST PRACTICES>

=over

=item * I<Do not include whitespace before the left-parenthesis C<(> character in a subroutine call.>

=item * I<Do not include unnecessary whitespace between the left-parenthesis C<(> and right-parenthesis C<)> characters in a subroutine call.>

=back

=for html </u>

The parentheses suffix is optional in normal Perl, and is required in RPerl:

    sweet_tooth;     # fine in Perl, error in RPerl
    sweet_tooth ();  # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl
    sweet_tooth( );  # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl
    sweet_tooth();   # fine in Perl, best  in RPerl

If we try to call an RPerl subroutine without the parentheses C<( )> suffix, we receive a Perl C<use strict;> error:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    ERROR ECOPAPL02, RPERL PARSER, PERL SYNTAX ERROR
    Failed normal Perl strictures-and-fatal-warnings syntax check with the following information:

        Return Value:     2
        Error Message(s): Bareword "hello_world" not allowed while "strict subs" in use

=for rperl X</noncode>

In normal Perl, subroutine calls may include an optional ampersand C<&> sigil prefix, but this is unnecessary and thus unsupported by RPerl:

     sweet_tooth();  # fine in Perl, fine  in RPerl
    &sweet_tooth();  # fine in Perl, error in RPerl

If we try to call an RPerl subroutine using an ampersand C<&> sigil, we receive a Perl::Critic policy violation:

=for rperl X<noncode>

        Description:  Subroutine called with "&" sigil
        Explanation:  See Perl Best Practices page(s) 175

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head2 Section 4.3: Subroutine Return Values

In the previous sections, both the C<hello_world()> and C<sweet_tooth()> example subroutines have return values of C<void>, which means no data is returned to the caller when these subroutines finish running.  If we try to utilize the return value of a C<void> subroutine, we will experience undefined behavior which will likely lead to other (possibly mysterious) errors in our code.  For example, the variable C<$foo> in the following line of source code will have an unknown and unpredictable value, because the return value of a C<void> subroutine is undefined:

    my integer $foo = hello_world();  # undefined behavior, unpredictable value in $foo

Likewise, the outcome of the following addition C<+> operator is unpredictable, and will probably cause other difficult-to-debug errors elsewhere in our source code:

    23 + hello_world()  # undefined behavior, unpredictable result

So, when we want to utilize the return value of a subroutine, we must give the subroutine a non-C<void> return type in the subroutine definition.

    our integer $jedi = sub { print q{"You love him, don't you?"}, "\n"; return 6; };

We can call the C<jedi()> subroutine defined above, and actually utilize the return value:

    my integer $episode = jedi();
    print 'Return (value) of the Jedi, Episode ', $episode, "\n";

The above subroutine call and C<print> statement produce the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    "You love him, don't you?"
    Return (value) of the Jedi, Episode 6

=for rperl X</noncode>

Your RPerl subroutines may have any return type chosen from the full list of supported RPerl data types, such as C<number>, C<string>, C<integer_arrayref>, etc.

=head3 Section 4.3.1: C<return> Operator

The C<jedi()> subroutine example in the previous section includes a C<return> operator at the end of the subroutine's body, which serves to return the value C<6> to the caller.  In other words, the input operand of the C<return> operator is the numeric literal C<6>, which is then passed back to whatever part of the software originally invoked the C<jedi()> subroutine.

The C<return> operator serves two purposes, both returning a specific return value to the caller, as well as controlling termination of the subroutine at some point before the end of the subroutine's body.  It is common to have multiple C<return> operators inside one subroutine, organized using conditional statements or other logic:

    if ($foo < $bar) {
        return 23;
    } 
    else {
        return 42;
    }

A subroutine with C<void> return type may also utilize the C<return> operator, in order to control when and where the subroutine terminates:

    if ($foo < $bar) {
        print '$foo is too small, returning', "\n";
        return;
    }

    print '$foo is not too small, continuing', "\n";
    $foo = $bar * 17;

In normal Perl, the C<return> operator is optional, and Perl automatically returns the vale of the last expression executed before the subroutine ends.  However, leaving out the C<return> operator in RPerl will once again lead to either an error, or undefined and unpredictable behavior in C++ compile modes.

            sub  jedi       { print q{"You love him, don't you?"}, "\n";        6; }   #   usable in Perl, error  in RPerl
    our integer $jedi = sub { print q{"You love him, don't you?"}, "\n";        6; };  # unusable in Perl, error  in RPerl
    our integer $jedi = sub { print q{"You love him, don't you?"}, "\n"; return 6; };  # unusable in Perl, usable in RPerl

If we exclude the C<return> operator as in the second line above, then we will receive an error in RPerl compiled modes, because the semicolon C<;> of C<6;> is found before an actual operator is encountered:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl jedi.pl

    ...

    ERROR ECOPARP00, RPERL PARSER, RPERL SYNTAX ERROR
    Failed RPerl grammar syntax check with the following information:
    
        File Name:         ...
        Line Number:       ...
        Unexpected Token:  ;
        ...

=for rperl X</noncode>

We can see undefined behavior when we fail to utilize a C<return> operator in a subroutine which should return a value, in this case an C<integer> should be returned but instead a string concatenation C<.> operator is performed without an explicit return value:

    our integer $unpredictable = sub { 'howdy' . 'doody'; };
    print 'have unpredictable() = ', unpredictable(), "\n";

When we run the above C<unpredictable()> subroutine in RPerl test mode C<-t>, we see the result of the string concatenation operator; when we run the same subroutine in RPerl compiled mode, we receive a seemingly-random number instead:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t unpredictable.pl
    have unpredictable() = howdydoody

    $ rperl unpredictable.pl 
    have unpredictable() = 140725691414304

=for rperl X</noncode>

We can try to add a C<return> operator to the C<unpredictable()> subroutine:

    our integer $unpredictable = sub { return 'howdy' . 'doody'; };
    print 'have unpredictable() = ', unpredictable(), "\n";

Adding the C<return> operator will lead to a C++ subcompile error, visible in RPerl debug mode C<-D>, because the string concatenation C<.> operator's C<string> return type does not match the C<unpredictable()> subroutine's C<integer> return type:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -D unpredictable_return.pl

    [[[ SUBCOMPILE STDERR ]]]

    unpredictable_return.cpp: In function âinteger unpredictable()â:

                                                        ^
    ERROR ECOCOSU04, COMPILER, SUBCOMPILE: C++ compiler returned error code, croaking...

=for rperl X</noncode>

For all subroutines with non-C<void> return types, you must always use the C<return> operator, and always provide the C<return> operator with operands of the correct return type.

=head3 Section 4.3.2: Multiple Return Values

In normal Perl, the C<return> operator may optionally be provided with more than one operand, thereby causing its subroutine to actually return multiple values to the originating caller.  In this case, the calling software must know how to properly receive back more than one return value from the invoked subroutine, or else you may receive the incorrect data or experience undefined behavior.

The following subroutine C<foo_multi()> is valid in normal Perl only:

    sub foo_multi { return 21, 22, 23; }
    (my $retval0, my $retval1, my $retval2) = foo_multi();
    print 'have $retval0 = ', $retval0, "\n";
    print 'have $retval1 = ', $retval1, "\n";
    print 'have $retval2 = ', $retval2, "\n";

Running the normal Perl C<foo_multi()> code above will produce the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $retval0 = 21
    have $retval1 = 22
    have $retval2 = 23

=for rperl X</noncode>

On the other hand, any RPerl subroutine defined with a non-C<void> return type must provide each of its C<return> operators with exactly one operand, thereby causing the subroutine to return exactly one value to the originating caller.  Likewise, all non-C<void> subroutine calls in RPerl must be designed to receive back exactly one data value of the subroutine's defined return type.  (As with many design aspects of the RPerl compiler, this particular requirement is based on the behavior of the C++ target language.)

    our integer $foo_single = sub { return 23; };
    my integer $retval = foo_single();
    print 'have $retval = ', $retval, "\n";

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $retval = 23

=for rperl X</noncode>

When you want to return multiple values from an RPerl subroutine, you may simply return an array reference containing more than one element, then you will receive back a single array reference in the caller and you access each element as needed.  In other words, you may wrap up multiple return values inside of a single array reference, and still be in compliance with the exactly-one-return-value requirement.

    our integer_arrayref $foo_multi = sub { return [21, 22, 23]; };
    my integer_arrayref $retvals = foo_multi();
    my integer $retval0 = $retvals->[0];
    my integer $retval1 = $retvals->[1];
    my integer $retval2 = $retvals->[2];
    print 'have $retval0 = ', $retval0, "\n";
    print 'have $retval1 = ', $retval1, "\n";
    print 'have $retval2 = ', $retval2, "\n";

Running the RPerl C<foo_multi()> code above will produce the exact same variables and output as the normal Perl C<foo_multi()> code:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $retval0 = 21
    have $retval1 = 22
    have $retval2 = 23

=for rperl X</noncode>

Currently, all RPerl subroutines utilizing an array reference return value must only return elements which all have the exact same data type as one another, because RPerl arrays are homogeneous with only one data type shared across all elements.  As mentioned in L</Section 3.2: 1-D Array Data Types & Constants>, future versions of RPerl will probably provide a C<scalar_arrayref> data structure which can hold elements of non-matching data types.

=head2 Section 4.4: Subroutine Arguments

When calling a subroutine, often you will want to provide one or more pieces of data as input to the subroutine; for this purpose, we use I<"subroutine arguments">.  Perl provides a special array variable named C<@ARG>, which contains all arguments which have been passed into each subroutine by its caller.  For any RPerl subroutine which accepts arguments, the first expression of the subroutine must always be the argument definition operation, as seen in the following source code example: 

    our void $foo_arg  = sub {
        (my integer $arg1) = @ARG;
        print 'inside foo_arg(), have $arg1 = ', integer_to_string($arg1), "\n";
    };
    foo_arg(1_701);

Running the C<foo_arg()> code example gives us this output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    inside foo_arg(), have $arg1 = 1_701

=for rperl X</noncode>

It's easy for a subroutine to accept multiple arguments, simply separate each argument's variable declaration by a comma C<,> character, and keep them all within the parentheses C<( )> characters:

    our void $foo_args = sub {
        (my integer $arg1, my number $arg2, my string $arg3) = @ARG;
        print 'have $arg1 * $arg2 = ', number_to_string($arg1 * $arg2), "\n";
        print 'have $arg3 x $arg1 = ', ($arg3 x $arg1), "\n";
    };
    foo_args(5, 2.575, 'over and ');

Running the C<foo_args()> code gives us:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $arg1 * $arg2 = 12.875
    have $arg3 x $arg1 = over and over and over and over and over and

=for rperl X</noncode>

Unsurprisingly, normal Perl provides magic which allows a subroutine to change its own argument names and data types at runtime, which is one of Perl's many dynamic behaviors.  In the source code example below, we see the C<shift> operator used to receive each argument one-at-a-time, where the name and (implied) data type of the second argument is dependent upon runtime conditional logic using the first argument:

    sub bar_args_dynamic {
        my $arg_type = shift @ARG;
        if ($arg_type eq 'integer') {
            my $bar_int = shift @ARG;
            print 'have $bar_int * 3 = ', $bar_int * 3, "\n";
        }
        else {
            my $bar_str = shift @ARG;
            print 'have $bar_str x 3 = ', $bar_str x 3, "\n";
        }
        return;
    }
    bar_args_dynamic('integer', 4);
    bar_args_dynamic('string', 'repeat');

Running the C<bar_args_dynamic()> subroutine example produces the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $bar_int * 3 = 12
    have $bar_str x 3 = repeatrepeatrepeat

=for rperl X</noncode>

In RPerl, the argument names and data types for each subroutine are set at compile time, which is one of RPerl's many static behaviors and which contributes to significant runtime performance optimizations.  In other words, one reason why RPerl is faster than normal Perl is because RPerl knows the names and data types for each subroutine when the C<rperl> compiler is run.

By always accepting three arguments, we can upgrade from the C<bar_args_dynamic()> subroutine to the C<bar_args_static()> subroutine, which can then be compiled with RPerl:

    our void $bar_args_static = sub {
        (my string $arg_type, my integer $bar_int, my string $bar_str) = @ARG;
        if ($arg_type eq 'integer') {
            print 'have $bar_int * 3 = ', $bar_int * 3, "\n";
        }
        else {
            print 'have $bar_str x 3 = ', $bar_str x 3, "\n";
        }
        return;
    };
    bar_args_static('integer', 4, q{});
    bar_args_static('string',  0, 'repeat');

Running C<bar_args_static()> gives us the exact same variables and output as C<bar_args_dynamic()>, now able to be compiled and run at a much faster speed:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $bar_int * 3 = 12
    have $bar_str x 3 = repeatrepeatrepeat

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 4.4.1: Variadic Subroutines

The number of arguments accepted by a subroutine is known as its "arity".  A subroutine, operator, or other operation which is capable of accepting a varying number of input arguments is known as "variadic".  (Please see L</D.3: Syntax Arity, Fixity, Precedence, Associativity> for more information.)

In the previous section, we saw the C<bar_args_dynamic()> subroutine use the C<shift> operator (and associated Perl magic) in order to control its own accepted arguments.  The same magic can be used in normal Perl to change, at runtime, the number of arguments accepted by a subroutine.

In normal Perl, a variadic subroutine can be created as follows:

    sub baz_variadic_dynamic {
        my $num_args = shift @ARG;
        my $arg2 = q{};
        my $arg3 = q{};
        my $arg4 = q{};
        if ($num_args >= 2) { $arg2 = shift @ARG; }
        if ($num_args >= 3) { $arg3 = shift @ARG; }
        if ($num_args >= 4) { $arg4 = shift @ARG; }
        print 'have $num_args = ', $num_args, "\n";
        print 'have $args2 = ', $arg2, "\n";
        print 'have $args3 = ', $arg3, "\n";
        print 'have $args4 = ', $arg4, "\n\n";
        return;
    }
    baz_variadic_dynamic(1);
    baz_variadic_dynamic(2, 'howdy');
    baz_variadic_dynamic(3, 'howdy', 'doody');
    baz_variadic_dynamic(4, 'howdy', 'doody', 'time');

Running the normal Perl subroutine C<baz_variadic_dynamic()>, we can see how the first argument C<$num_args> is used to control how many additional arguments are accepted:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $num_args = 1
    have $args2 = 
    have $args3 = 
    have $args4 = 

    have $num_args = 2
    have $args2 = howdy
    have $args3 = 
    have $args4 = 

    have $num_args = 3
    have $args2 = howdy
    have $args3 = doody
    have $args4 = 

    have $num_args = 4
    have $args2 = howdy
    have $args3 = doody
    have $args4 = time

=for rperl X</noncode>

As we did with subroutine return values in L</Section 4.3.2: Multiple Return Values>, we can use an array reference to simulate a variadic subroutine while maintaining compatibility with RPerl:

    our void $baz_variadic_static = sub {
        (my integer $num_args, my string_arrayref $args) = @ARG;
        my string $arg2 = q{};
        my string $arg3 = q{};
        my string $arg4 = q{};
        if ($num_args >= 2) { $arg2 = $args->[0]; }
        if ($num_args >= 3) { $arg3 = $args->[1]; }
        if ($num_args >= 4) { $arg4 = $args->[2]; }
        print 'have $num_args = ', $num_args, "\n";
        print 'have $args2 = ', $arg2, "\n";
        print 'have $args3 = ', $arg3, "\n";
        print 'have $args4 = ', $arg4, "\n\n";
        return;
    };
    baz_variadic_static(1, []);
    baz_variadic_static(2, ['howdy']);
    baz_variadic_static(3, ['howdy', 'doody']);
    baz_variadic_static(4, ['howdy', 'doody', 'time']);

In the C<baz_variadic_static()> subroutine example above, we accept an array reference argument named C<$args> and retrieve its elements as controlled by the C<$num_args> input argument, achieving the same outcome as in C<baz_variadic_dynamic()>.  You will note the variable C<$arg2> receives its value from C<$args-E<gt>[0]> which is a seeming index difference of 2, caused by array indices starting at 0 instead of 1, combined with the fact that we have already accepted C<$num_args> as a separate argument altogether.

Also, when we call C<baz_variadic_static()>, all arguments after the first must be wrapped in the square-brackets C<[ ]>, denoting an array reference.

As you may expect, running the C<baz_variadic_static()> subroutine gives us the same variables and output as C<baz_variadic_dynamic()>, with the added performance optimizations of the RPerl compiler:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    have $num_args = 1
    have $args2 = 
    have $args3 = 
    have $args4 = 

    have $num_args = 2
    have $args2 = howdy
    have $args3 = 
    have $args4 = 

    have $num_args = 3
    have $args2 = howdy
    have $args3 = doody
    have $args4 = 

    have $num_args = 4
    have $args2 = howdy
    have $args3 = doody
    have $args4 = time

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head2 Section 4.5: Subroutine Variables, Variable Scope & Persistence

In normal Perl, variables inside a subroutine may behave in several complex ways, depending upon if and how the variable was declared, which can happen both inside and outside the subroutine itself.  Perl provides a number of different ways to create a variable, including the by-now familiar C<my> keyword, as well as the C<our> and C<state> keywords, and others.

Perl variables possess many (often magic) properties which affect their behavior, two of which are I<"scope"> and I<"persistence">.  The scope of a variable is the subroutine, code block, or other region of code within which the variable is valid and accessible.  Attempting to utilize a variable outside of its scope will lead to errors and undefined behavior.

The persistence of a variable is how long the variable will remain valid, before its memory is released and it is no longer accessible from anywhere within your Perl program.  As with out-of-scope variables, attepting to access a variable after its persistence has expired will result in errors and undefined behavior.

Perl variables declared using the C<my> keyword are classified as possessing I<"local scope">, as well as I<"intermittent persistence"> (AKA I<"non-persistent">).  This means C<my> variables declared inside a subroutine will only be valid within their own subroutine (local scope), and must be re-declared each time the subroutine is executed (intermittent).  In Perl terminology, "local scope" is generally synonymous with "lexical scope" and "private scope".  The C<my> variable is the safest, simplest, and most optimizable classification of Perl variable.

    use strict;
    #print 'before defining quux(), have $local_intermittent = ', $local_intermittent, "\n";  # YES ERROR
    our void $quux = sub {
        my integer $local_intermittent = 23;
        print 'inside quux(), have $local_intermittent = ', $local_intermittent, "\n";        # NO  ERROR
        $local_intermittent++;
    };
    #print 'after  defining quux(), have $local_intermittent = ', $local_intermittent, "\n";  # YES ERROR

    quux();
    #print 'after   calling quux(), have $local_intermittent = ', $local_intermittent, "\n";  # YES ERROR
    quux();
    #print 'after   calling quux(), have $local_intermittent = ', $local_intermittent, "\n";  # YES ERROR

Running the example code above, which utilizes a C<my> variable, gives us the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    inside quux(), have $local_intermittent = 23
    inside quux(), have $local_intermittent = 23

=for rperl X</noncode>

Perl variables declared using C<our> are of I<"global scope"> and are I<"persistent">, which means C<our> variables may be accessed from anywhere within your Perl program and will never need to be re-declared.  This is one of the least safe, simple, and optimizable classifications of variable.

    use strict;
    our integer $global_persistent = 23;
    print 'before defining quux(), have $global_persistent = ', $global_persistent, "\n";  # NO ERROR
    our void $quux = sub {
        print 'inside          quux(), have $global_persistent = ', $global_persistent, "\n";       # NO ERROR
        $global_persistent++;
    };
    print 'after  defining quux(), have $global_persistent = ', $global_persistent, "\n";  # NO ERROR

    quux();
    print 'after   calling quux(), have $global_persistent = ', $global_persistent, "\n";  # NO ERROR
    quux();
    print 'after   calling quux(), have $global_persistent = ', $global_persistent, "\n";  # NO ERROR


Running this C<our> variable example code produces the output below:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    before defining quux(), have $global_persistent = 23
    after  defining quux(), have $global_persistent = 23
    inside          quux(), have $global_persistent = 23
    after   calling quux(), have $global_persistent = 24
    inside          quux(), have $global_persistent = 24
    after   calling quux(), have $global_persistent = 25

=for rperl X</noncode>

Perl variables declared using C<state> are of local scope and are persistent; this means C<state> variables may be accessed only from within the area of code where they were defined, but they do not ever need to be re-declared, and they will retain their values between each execution of their enclosing code block.  A C<state> variable declared inside a subroutine will save its value each time the subroutine is executed, providing yet another convenient use of magic in normal Perl.  Like C<our> variables, C<state> variables score low for safety, simplicity, and optimizability.

    use strict;
    use feature 'state';
    #print 'before defining quux(), have $local_persistent = ', $local_persistent, "\n";  # YES ERROR
    our void $quux = sub {
        state integer $local_persistent = 23;
        print 'inside quux(), have $local_persistent = ', $local_persistent, "\n";        # NO  ERROR
        $local_persistent++;
    };
    #print 'after  defining quux(), have $local_persistent = ', $local_persistent, "\n";  # YES ERROR

    quux();
    #print 'after   calling quux(), have $local_persistent = ', $local_persistent, "\n";  # YES ERROR
    quux();
    #print 'after   calling quux(), have $local_persistent = ', $local_persistent, "\n";  # YES ERROR

Executing the C<state> variable example code above will generate the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    inside quux(), have $local_persistent = 23
    inside quux(), have $local_persistent = 24

=for rperl X</noncode>

In normal Perl, a variable which is utilized without first being declared will usually undergo the process of I<"autovivification">, which means the variable is automatically created by Perl, according to Perl's own internal rules.  Variables which have been autovivified may cause many difficult-to-debug issues, such as misspelled variables taking data without emitting any warnings, etc.  Because of this, the C<use strict;> pragma will cause an error to be triggered by any variables which would normally be autovivified.  Like C<our> and C<state> variables, autovivified variables receive a low score for safety, simplicity, and speed.

    print 'before defining quux(), have $autovivified = ', $autovivified, "\n";  # NO ERROR, YES WARNING
    our void $quux = sub {
        $autovivified = 23;
        print 'inside         quux(), have $autovivified = ', $autovivified, "\n";       # NO ERROR
        $autovivified++;
    };
    print 'after  defining quux(), have $autovivified = ', $autovivified, "\n";  # NO ERROR, YES WARNING

    quux();
    print 'after   calling quux(), have $autovivified = ', $autovivified, "\n";  # NO ERROR
    quux();
    print 'after   calling quux(), have $autovivified = ', $autovivified, "\n";  # NO ERROR

Executing the autovivified code requires us to first disable C<use strict;>, after which it will run with warnings:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Use of uninitialized value $autovivified in print
    before defining quux(), have $autovivified = 
    Use of uninitialized value $autovivified in print
    after  defining quux(), have $autovivified = 
    inside          quux(), have $autovivified = 23
    after   calling quux(), have $autovivified = 24
    inside          quux(), have $autovivified = 23
    after   calling quux(), have $autovivified = 24

=for rperl X</noncode>

In RPerl, all variables are created using the C<my> keyword, because it is the best choice: C<my> variables are the least prone to cause errors, they are the easiest to convert into C++ output code, and they are the most optimizable.  Also, because all RPerl code must utilize the C<use strict;> pragma, there is no autovivification of RPerl variables.  RPerl does not support C<our> variables, C<state> variables, autovivified variables, or any kind other than C<my> variables.

=head3 Section 4.5.1: C<my> Intermittent Variables

You may recall we analyzed part of the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine in L</Section 3.11: Converting From Array To String>.  This particular subroutine makes use of multiple C<my> variables, the significance of which is discussed after the source code example.

As promised, we will now review the full subroutine, for Perl operations & Perl data types mode:

    # stringify an integer_arrayref
    our string $integer_arrayref_to_string = sub {
        # require exactly one integer_arrayref as input, store in variable $input_avref
        ( my integer_arrayref $input_avref ) = @ARG;

        # declare local variables, av & sv mean "array value" & "scalar value" as used in Perl core
        my integer $input_av_length;
        my integer $input_av_element;
        my string $output_sv;
        my boolean $i_is_0 = 1;

        # compute length of (number of elements in) input array
        $input_av_length = scalar @{$input_avref};

        # begin output string with left-square-bracket, as required for all RPerl arrays
        $output_sv = '[';

        # loop through all valid values of $i for use as index to input array
        for my integer $i ( 0 .. ( $input_av_length - 1 ) ) {
            # retrieve input array's element at index $i
            $input_av_element = $input_avref->[$i];

            # append comma & space to output string for all elements except index 0
            if ($i_is_0) { $i_is_0 = 0; }
            else         { $output_sv .= ', '; }

            # stringify individual integer element, append to output string
            $output_sv .= integer_to_string($input_av_element);
        }

        # end output string with right-square-bracket, as required for all RPerl arrays
        $output_sv .= ']';

        # return output string, containing stringified input array
        return $output_sv;
    };

The above subroutine's name is, unsurprisingly, C<integer_arrayref_to_string()>; it accepts exactly one input operand, an C<integer_arrayref> accessed via the variable C<$input_avref>, and it generates as output a string formed in the variable C<$output_sv>.

In addition to the input operand, the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine defines four normal C<my> variables: C<$input_av_length>, C<$input_av_element>, C<$output_sv>, and C<$i_is_0>.  Also, the special loop iterator variable C<$i> is declared using the C<my> keyword.

The values of the four normal C<my> variables are accessible only within this subroutine; in other words, they are locally-scoped AKA lexically-scoped variables.  Any attempt to access or modify the values of the C<$input_av_length>, C<$input_av_element>, C<$output_sv>, or C<$i_is_0> variables outside the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine will result in an error or undefined behavior.

The value of the special loop iterator C<$i> has an even smaller scope, because it is only valid within the C<for> loop body.  The accepted terminology is to say that C<$i> is a I<"lexical loop iterator"> variable.  Any attempt to utilize the C<$i> variable outside the loop body code block will result in an error or undefined behavior.

This style of programming, where all variables are created using the C<my> keyword, allows our code to undergo additional optimizations for memory usage, serial runtime performance, and parallel runtime performance.  Thus, we always use lexically-scoped variables created using Perl's C<my> keyword, in order to make our RPerl output code run as fast as possible.

The string generated as output of the C<integer_arrayref_to_string()> subroutine is itself valid RPerl source code, and may be copied, pasted, and re-parsed by the RPerl compiler:

    my integer_arrayref $foo;
    $foo = [8, 23, 17];
    print '$foo = ', integer_arrayref_to_string($foo), ';', "\n";

Running the code example above generates the following output string, which is itself an exact replica of the original line of valid RPerl source code:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $foo = [8, 23, 17];

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 Section 4.5.2: Persistent State, Pseudo-State Variables

RPerl does not support variables created using the magic C<state> keyword.  If you want to maintain a persistent state variable for one of your subroutines, then you may simply use the C<my> keyword to declare a variable before calling the subroutine, pass the variable as a differently-named input argument to the subroutine, access and modify the variable while inside the subroutine, return the variable from the subroutine, receive the returned value back into the original variable, and repeat for as many times as you like.  Each time your subroutine runs, it will be able to utilize the persistent state contained within your variable, even though you used the C<my> keyword instead of the C<state> keyword to declare the variable.

We coin the term C<"pseudo-state variable"> to mean a low-magic C<my> variable used to simulate the behavior of a high-magic C<state> variable.

    our integer $foo = sub {
        ( my integer $pseudo_state_in_foo ) = @ARG;
        print 'inside foo(), received $pseudo_state_in_foo = ', $pseudo_state_in_foo, "\n";
        $pseudo_state_in_foo++;
        print 'inside foo(), have modified $pseudo_state_in_foo = ', $pseudo_state_in_foo, "\n";
        return $pseudo_state_in_foo;
    };

    my integer $pseudo_state = 0;

    $pseudo_state = foo($pseudo_state);
    $pseudo_state = foo($pseudo_state);
    $pseudo_state = foo($pseudo_state);
    $pseudo_state = foo($pseudo_state);
    $pseudo_state = foo($pseudo_state);

Outside the subroutine, we declare our variable with the expressive name C<$pseudo_state> as an indication of its purpose, although you may certainly choose to name your variable(s) differently.

Inside the subroutine, we declare our variable with a different name, in this case C<$pseudo_state_in_foo>; by doing so, we remind ourselves these are truly two different variables with different scopes, and we also avoid any possible errors or unexpected behavior.  The persistent variable is C<$pseudo_state>, because its value persists after each call to C<foo()> returns.  The non-persistent variable is C<$pseudo_state_in_foo>, because its value is accessible only inside each individual call to C<foo()>.  The trick to creating a pseudo-state variable is to make a connection between a persistent variable outside of a subroutine and a non-persistent variable inside the subroutine, as we have done in the example code above.

Running the pseudo-state source code example above produces the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    inside foo(), received $pseudo_state_in_foo = 0
    inside foo(), have modified $pseudo_state_in_foo = 1
    inside foo(), received $pseudo_state_in_foo = 1
    inside foo(), have modified $pseudo_state_in_foo = 2
    inside foo(), received $pseudo_state_in_foo = 2
    inside foo(), have modified $pseudo_state_in_foo = 3

=head2 Section 4.6: C<use strict; use warnings;> Pragmas & Magic

We have already been exposed to the C<use strict;> and C<use warnings;> source code components; these are both classified as Perl I<"pragmata"> AKA I<"pragma"> statements, which are special configuration controls used to change the way Perl itself functions.  Both C<strict> and C<warnings> pragmas appear in the header section of all RPerl programs:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # [[[ HEADER ]]]
    use RPerl;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    our $VERSION = 0.001_000;

    # [[[ CRITICS ]]]
    ## no critic qw(ProhibitUselessNoCritic ProhibitMagicNumbers RequireCheckedSyscalls)  # USER DEFAULT 1: allow numeric values & print operator

    # [[[ OPERATIONS ]]]
    print 'Howdy, Earth!', "\n";

Each of these pragma statements has multiple effects upon the Perl program for which they are enabled.  The most pertinent outcome of the C<use strict;> statement is to disable variable autovivification, which is why there is no C<strict> pragmata in the autovivified example of L</Section 4.5: Subroutine Variables, Variable Scope & Persistence>.

The C<use warnings;> pragma enables numerous helpful warning messages, which are an invaluable aid to the development of reliable and bug-free Perl software.  In the case of warnings generated at compile time, RPerl will automatically cause such warnings to become fatal errors, and will provide as much information as possible to help you fix any issues before you try again.

Utilizing these two pragmata statements is the first step toward disabling all of Perl's unnecessary and unwanted magic, which is cleverly hidden throughout every normal Perl program.  This direct use of C<strict> and C<warnings> occurs during RPerl's parse phase 0, which is the "Check Perl Syntax" phase.  It is impossible to disable C<use strict;> and C<use warnings;> in RPerl, as they are required to pass RPerl's parse phase 1 AKA "Criticize Perl Syntax", as well as parse phase 2 AKA "Parse RPerl Syntax". 

All true Perl Monks harken to the (wise?) words of our own Perl Prophet, The Voice In The Wilderness:

=head2 Section 4.7: Exercises

=head3 1.  Subroutine To Calculate Total Of Numeric Array Elements  [ 45 mins ]

In the same F<LearningRPerl> directory from the the previous chapters' exercises, create a new sub-directory named (you guessed it!) F<Chapter4>.  In the new sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_1-subroutine_total.pl>.

Write an RPerl program which includes an array variable named C<$fred> containing the data C<[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]>.  Add a subroutine named C<total()> which accepts as input a C<number_arrayref> and returns a C<number> representing the sum total of all array elements.  First, call C<total($fred)> and display the results.  Next, prompt the user to input as many numbers as they like, separated by <ENTER> and ended by <CTRL-D>, then store the results in an array and display the results of calling C<total()> on the array.  Remember to use the C<number_to_string()> or C<to_string()> subroutines.

Your program should generate exactly the following output, when provided with the corresponding input:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl LearningRPerl/Chapter4/exercise_1-subroutine_total.pl
    The total of $fred is 25
    Please input zero or more numbers, separated by <ENTER>, ended by <CTRL-D>:
    8
    23
    17
    The total of those numbers is 48

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 2.  Subroutine To Calculate Total Of Numbers 1 Through 1_000  [ 15 mins ]

In the F<Chapter4> sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_2-subroutine_total_1000.pl>.

Write an RPerl program which includes the same subroutine C<total()> from the previous exercise; you may copy-and-paste your own working source code, or re-write the subroutine from scratch, whichever you prefer.  Create an array variable named C<$one_to_one_thousand>, and make use of the range C<..> operator to fill the variable with consecutive integers starting with C<1> and ending with C<1_000>.  Call the subroutine and pass your variable as the input argument, then display the result.

Your program should generate exactly the following output:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter4/exercise_2-subroutine_total_1000.pl 
    The total of 1 to 1000 is 500_500.

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 3.  Subroutine To Find Above-Average Array Elements  [ 45 mins ]

In the F<Chapter4> sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_3-subroutine_above_average.pl>.

As in the previous exercise, write an RPerl program which includes the same subroutine C<total()> once again.  Add a subroutine named C<average()>, which accepts a C<number_arrayref> as input argument and returns a C<number> representing the arithmetic mean of the array elements; call the subroutine C<total()> from within C<average()> as part of calculating the mean value.  Next, add another subroutine named C<above_average()>, which also accepts a C<number_arrayref> argument, and which returns a different C<number_arrayref> containing only the input array elements which are above the array's arithmetic mean; call the C<average()> subroutine from within C<above_average()> as part of your algorithm.

Now, create an array variable named C<$fred>, and use the range C<..> operator to populate the array with the integers C<1> through C<10>.  Display all the values in C<$fred>, then call C<above_average()> with C<$fred> as the input argument and display the results.

Lastly, create another array variable named C<$barney>, and fill it with all the same values as C<$fred>, with the addition of the value C<100> added as the very first element (index 0) of C<$barney>.  As before, display the values in the C<$barney> array, then pass it as the argument to C<above_average()> and display the results.

Include some helpful hard-coded messages, to let your users know if the correct output is being generated.

Your program should generate exactly the following output, when provided with the corresponding input:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter4/exercise_3-subroutine_above_average.pl 
    $fred is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    The above-average elements of $fred are [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    (Should be [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

    $barney is [100, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    The above-average elements of $barney are [100]
    (Should be just [100])

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 4.  Subroutine To Greet User & Store Program State  [ 30 mins ]

In the F<Chapter4> sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_4-subroutine_greet.pl>.

Write an RPerl program which includes a subroutine named C<greet()>, which accepts as input two C<string> variables called C<$name> and C<$previous_name>, and which returns a single C<string> variable.  The C<greet()> subroutine should say "Hi" to the person whose name has been passed in as an argument; if C<$previous_name> is an empty string then tell the person they are the first one, otherwise tell them who was the previous person to be greeted.  Return the name of the person you have just greeted.

Outside the subroutine, create another different (although identically-named) C<string> variable called C<$previous_name>, and set its initial value to equal the empty string C<q{}>.  Call the C<greet()> subroutine 4 times in a row with the following input names: C<'Fred'>, C<'Barney'>, C<'Wilma'>, and C<'Betty'>.  Store the return value of each subroutine call back into the C<$previous_name> variable, and pass it as the second argument to each subsequent subroutine call.

Your program should generate exactly the following output, when provided with the specified names:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter4/exercise_4-subroutine_greet.pl 
    Hi Fred!  You are the first one here!
    Hi Barney!  Fred is also here!
    Hi Wilma!  Barney is also here!
    Hi Betty!  Wilma is also here!

=for rperl X</noncode>

=head3 5.  Subroutine To Greet User & Store More Program State  [ 35 mins ]

In the F<Chapter4> sub-directory, create an RPerl program file named F<exercise_5-subroutine_greet_multiple.pl>.

As in the previous exercise, write an RPerl program which includes a new subroutine, also named C<greet()>.  This version of C<greet()> accepts as input a C<string> argument called C<$name>, as well as a C<string_arrayref> argument called C<$previous_names>.  This C<greet()> subroutine works similarly to the previous exercise, except it is capable of displaying multiple previous names, and it returns the C<$previous_names> array updated to include the latest person's C<$name>.

Your program should generate exactly the following output, when provided with the same names as the previous exercise:

=for rperl X<noncode>

    $ rperl -t LearningRPerl/Chapter4/exercise_5-subroutine_greet_multiple.pl 
    Hi Fred!  You are the first one here!
    Hi Barney!  I've seen: Fred
    Hi Wilma!  I've seen: Fred Barney
    Hi Betty!  I've seen: Fred Barney Wilma

=head1 APPENDIX A: EXERCISE ANSWERS

=head2 Chapter 1, Exercise 1

This exercise is commonly used as the first task for new programmers, or for programmers who are learning a new language.X<br>

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the boilerplate (often-repeated template) RPerl C<HEADER> and C<CRITICS> code sections, as well as the basic C<print> operator.X<br>

The first line, starting with C<#!> and called a "shebang", tells the operating system to run this program using Perl.X<br>

The 4 lines in the C<HEADER> section tell Perl to run this program using RPerl, and the C<$VERSION> number may be incremented for each update to this file.X<br>

The line in the C<CRITICS> section, starting with C<##>, tells RPerl to allow hard-coded numeric values (not used in this program), as well as the C<print> operator.X<br>

The last line, in the C<OPERATIONS> section, calls the C<print> operator on a comma-separated list consisting of 2 string literals, which will simply display the text "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character.X<br>

All other lines beginning with C<#> are comments and, along with blank lines, may be safely ignored or removed.X<br>


    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # Learning RPerl, Chapter 1, Exercise 1
    # Print "Hello, World!"; the classic first program for new programmers

	            rperl [ARGUMENTS] MyClassFoo.pm [MyClassBar.pm MyClassBat.pm ...]
	            rperl [ARGUMENTS] input_program_0.pl MyClassFoo.pm [input_program_1.pl ... MyClassBar.pm ...]

	Arguments:
	    --help ...OR... -h ...OR... -?
	            Print this (relatively) brief help message for command-line usage.
	            For additional explanations, run the command `perldoc RPerl::Learning` and see Appendix B.

	    --version ...OR... -v
	    --vversion ...OR... -vv
    	        Print version number and copyright information.
	            Repeat as 'vv' for more technical information, similar to `perl -V` configuration summary argument.
	            Lowercase 'v' not to be confused with uppercase 'V' in 'Verbose' argument.

	    --infile=MyFile.pm ...OR... -i=MyFile.pm
	            Specify input file, may be repeated for multiple input files.
    	        Argument prefix '--infile' may be entirely omitted.
	            Argument prefix MUST be omitted to specify wildcard for multiple input files.

	    --outfile=MyCompiledModule ...OR... -o=MyCompiledModule
    	--outfile=my_compiled_program ...OR... -o=my_compiled_program
	            Specify output file prefix, may be repeated for multiple output files.
	            RPerl *.pm input file with PERL ops will create MyCompiledModule.pmc output file.
	            RPerl *.pl input file with PERL ops will create my_compiled_program (or my_compiled_program.exe on Windows) output file.
	            RPerl *.pm input file with CPP  ops will create MyCompiledModule.pmc, MyCompiledModule.cpp, & MyCompiledModule.h output files.
	            RPerl *.pl input file with CPP  ops will create my_compiled_program (or my_compiled_program.exe on Windows) & my_compiled_program.cpp output files.
    	        Argument may be entirely omitted, foo.* input file will default to foo.* output file(s).

	    --CXX=/path/to/compiler
	            Specify path to C++ compiler for use in subcompile modes, equivalent to '--mode CXX=/path/to/compiler' or 'CXX' manual Makefile argument, 'g++' by default.

	    --mode magic=LOW ...OR... -m magic=LOW
	    --mode magic=MEDIUM ...OR... -m magic=MEDIUM
	    --mode magic=HIGH ...OR... -m magic=HIGH
    	        Specify magic mode, LOW by default.
	            If set to LOW, accept low-magic (static) Perl source code in the source code input file(s).
	            If set to MEDIUM, accept medium-magic (mostly static) Perl source code in the source code input file(s).
	            If set to HIGH, accept high-magic (dynamic) Perl source code in the source code input file(s).
	            Because only low-magic mode is supported at this time, this option does not currently have any effect.

	    --mode code=PERL ...OR... -m code=PERL
	    --mode code=CPP ...OR... -m code=CPP
	            Specify source code mode, CPP by default.
	            If set to PERL, generate Perl source code in the source code output file(s).
	            If set to CPP, generate C++ source code in the source code output file(s).
	            PERL operations mode forces PERL code mode; CPP operations mode forces CPP code mode.
	            Because code mode is dependent upon operations mode, this option does not currently have any effect.

	    --mode ops=PERL ...OR... -m ops=PERL
	    --mode ops=CPP ...OR... -m ops=CPP
	            Specify operations mode, CPP by default.

	            If set to CPP, generate C++ operations in the source code output file(s).
	            PERL ops mode forces PERL types mode & PARSE or GENERATE compile mode; PERLOPS_PERLTYPES is test mode, does not actually compile.

	    --mode types=PERL ...OR... -m types=PERL
	    --mode types=CPP ...OR... -m types=CPP
	    --mode types=DUAL ...OR... -m types=DUAL
	            Specify data types mode, CPP by default.
	            If set to PERL, generate Perl data types in the source code output file(s).
	            If set to CPP, generate C++ data types in the source code output file(s).
    	        If set to DUAL, generate both Perl and C++ data types in the source code output file(s).
	            DUAL mode allows generate-once-compile-many types, selected by '#define __FOO__TYPES' in lib/rperltypes_mode.h or `gcc -D__FOO__TYPES` manual subcompile argument.

=head2 Chapter 1, Exercise 3

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with basic variables and arithmetic.X<br>

The shebang line, C<HEADER> section, and first line in the C<CRITICS> section are the same boilerplate as the previous exercise.X<br>

The second line in the C<CRITICS> section tells RPerl to allow the C<$> (dollar) character, among others, to be displayed using the C<print> operator.X<br>

The first 3 lines in the C<OPERATIONS> section each declare a new variable; C<$foo> and C<$bar> each hold an C<integer> (non-floating-point) numeric value, while C<$baz> holds a C<number> (floating-point) value.X<br>

The C<$foo> and C<$bar> variables receive their values from hard-coded numeric values being operated upon by the addition C<+> and multiplication C<*> operators, respectively; the C<$baz> and C<$zab> variables receive their values from the the C<$foo> and C<$bar> variables being operated upon by the division C</> operator.  The C<to_number()> type conversion subroutine is necessary for the C++ compiler to use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer arithmetic on the division C</> operators, without it we would receive the truncated integer value of C<58> in C<$baz>, for example.  We will receive the correct floating-point answers if we call C<to_number()> on either C<$bar> (as shown), or C<$foo>, or both; in other words, at least one of the input operands for each operator must be passed through C<to_number()>.X<br>

The last 4 lines call the C<print> operator to display the names of each variable; followed by each variable's respective value, converted from number to underscore-formatted string via the RPerl type conversion subroutine C<to_string()>; followed by a newline character.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 2, Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with constant values.X<br>

The first line in the C<CRITICS> section tells RPerl to allow hard-coded numeric values as well as the C<print> operator, both of which are utilized in this program.X<br>

The second line in the C<CRITICS> section tells RPerl to allow the C<use constant> operation.X<br>

The line in the C<CONSTANTS> section declares a number (floating-point) constant value named C<PI>, automatically accessible via a subroutine named C<PI()>.X<br>

The inner type variable C<$TYPED_PI> is only used for RPerl parsing purposes; for example, if your constant is named C<FOO> then you should declare it using the inner type variable C<$TYPED_FOO> and you should access it by calling the subroutine C<FOO()>, but you should never directly utilize the variable C<$TYPED_FOO> anywhere else in your code.X<br>

The first 2 lines in the C<OPERATIONS> section each create a new number variable, with C<$radius> set to the hard-coded value of C<12.5> and C<$circumference> set to the well-known basic geometry formula "circumference equals 2 pi times radius".X<br>

The last 3 lines call the C<print> operator to display the values of C<PI>, C<$radius>, and C<$circumference>, each followed by a newline character.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 2, Exercise 5

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the C<x> string repeat operator.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> is accessed twice to collect user input for a string variable C<$repeat_string> to be repeated, and an integer variable C<$repeat_integer> to specify the number of repetitions.X<br>

The last line contains 2 operators, C<print> and the C<x> string repeat operator.X<br>

Like the C<.> (single dot) string concatenation operator, the C<x> operator has a higher precedence than C<print> and is thus executed first, generating a single string value comprised of the original string repeated 0 or more times, then the resulting string is displayed by calling C<print>.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 2, Exercise 6

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the C<while> loop control structure.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> is accessed to collect user input into the string variable C<$n_string>, then the data type conversion subroutine C<string_to_integer()> is called to create the corresponding integer variable C<$n>.X<br>

The C<if ($n E<lt> 0)> conditional control structure calls C<die> to exit with an error message if C<$n> is not a positive value.X<br>

Two additional integer variables are created: C<$sum> is initialized to 0 and will eventually hold the final answer value; and C<$i> is initialized to 0 for use as the iteration counter variable (AKA I<"iterator">) inside the following C<while> loop control structure.X<br>

The C<while> loop iteratively executes as long as the integer value of C<$i> is less-than-or-equal-to C<$n>.  Each iteration of the C<while> loop causes the value of C<$sum> to be increased by C<$i>, after which C<$i> itself is incremented by 1, and the loop is repeated.X<br>

The last line calls C<print>, the C<to_string()> conversion subroutine, and the C<.> (single dot) string concatenation operator to display the final answer.X<br>

X<br>


=head2 Chapter 2, Exercise 7

The goal of this exercise is to utilize an optimization to remove the C<while> loop from the previous exercise.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, user input is collected and error-checked, as before.X<br>

By utilizing an algorithm attributed to Gauss, we are able to remove the C<while> loop, so we also remove the C<$i> loop iterator.  The C<$sum> variable is kept the same as the previous exercise.X<br>

Two new integer variables are also created: C<$n_original> is initialized to hold a copy of C<$n> which will never change; and C<$n_odd> is initialized to 0.X<br>

The code block beginning with C<if ($n % 2)> is used to detect if the user provided a value for C<$n> which is odd (not even), this is detected by utilizing the C<%> modulo operator to test for a remainder of dividing C<$n> by 2.  If C<$n> is odd, then a second copy of the original value of C<$n> is stored in C<$n_odd>, after which C<$n> itself is decremented by 1.  This C<if> statement allows our algorithm to accept odd as well as even user input values for C<$n>.X<br>

The computational kernel (most important part) is the one line of arithmetic: C<$sum = (($n + 1) * ($n / 2)) + $n_odd;>X<br>

Recall the story of Gauss's algorithm in the exercise description; our arithmetic generalizes the idea of young Gauss by using C<$n> instead of 100, and by adding C<$n_odd> to enable support for odd values of C<$n>.  Using Gauss' own example of C<$n> equal to 100, which is even (not odd) so C<$n_odd> will equal 0, we can see the algorithm becomes: C<$sum = ((100 + 1) * (100 / 2)) + 0;>X<br>

One more step of arithmetic simplification shows our algorithm to be the same as Gauss': C<$sum = 101 * 50;>X<br>

The last line calls C<print> using the value of C<$n_original>, because the value of C<$n> will have been decreased by 1 if C<$n> is odd.X<br>

It is usually faster to run an algorithm without a loop than with a loop, because you are only doing 1 thing instead of many things.  However, not all problems can be easily optimized by changing to a new algorithm, because it may be prohibitively complex or there may only be 1 known algorithm.  In this case, Gauss' algorithm should be faster than the C<while> loop algorithm, expecially for very large values of C<$n>.  It may be possible to further optimize this exercise by utilizing bitwise operators to replace the modulo and division operators.X<br>

X<br>


=head2 Chapter 3, Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the C<foreach> loop control structure, arrays, and array operators; and to become further familiarized with the C<while> loop.X<br>

The first line in the C<OPERATIONS> section declares a new variable C<$input_strings> of type C<string_arrayref>, which is capable of storing 0 or more individual string values, and C<$input_strings> is then initialized to contain the empty set C<[]>.X<br>

The line starting with C<while (my string $input_string = E<lt>STDINE<gt>)> denotes the beginning of an iterative (repeating) loop statement, which continues to accept and store user input until CTRL-D is pressed to indicate the EOF (end-of-file) condition, also known as EOT (end-of-transmission).X<br>

A new copy of the variable C<$input_string> is created and assigned the value of collected user input by calling C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> at the start of each loop iteration; the C<my> operator is evaluated as a true condition and the loop repeats, until CTRL-D is received and the C<my> operator returns a false condition.X<br>

Inside the body of the C<while> loop is 1 line calling the C<push> operator, which appends the current iteration's value of C<$input_string> onto the list of strings contained in C<$input_strings>.X<br>

The at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }> is the array dereference operator, which exists because in Perl it is still sometimes necessary to directly access an array by value, instead of the RPerl method of indirectly accessing the array by reference, such as is required by the C<push> operator.X<br>

The line starting with C<my string_arrayref $input_strings_reversed> declares another array of string values C<input_strings_reversed>, and then assigns it the strings contained within the first array C<$input_strings> in reversed order, as returned by calling the C<reverse> operator.X<br>

As with the C<push> operator, the C<reverse> operator requires its argument to be dereferenced using at-sign-curly-braces C<@{ }>; another dereferenced array value is returned by C<reverse>, and an array reference is returned by enclosing C<reverse> and its argument inside the square-brackets C<[ ]> array reference operator.X<br>

Finally, the line starting with C<foreach my string $input_strings_reversed_element> denotes the beginning of another loop statement, which iterates the value of C<$input_strings_reversed_element> once for each string value contained in the C<$input_strings_reversed> array; C<print> is called inside the loop body to display the original input strings in reverse order.X<br>

X<br>


=head2 Chapter 3, Exercise 2

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with utilizing array indices.X<br>

The first line in the C<OPERATIONS> section declares a new variable C<$flintstones_and_rubbles> of type C<string_arrayref>, which is then initialized to contain a C<qw()> (quote word) set of names including the string element 'fred' at array index 0, 'betty' at array index 1, and so on.X<br>

The second line in C<OPERATIONS> creates an empty array of integers C<$input_indices>, and the following C<while> loop uses the C<push> operator to fill C<$input_indices> with integers entered by the user.X<br>

The C<foreach> loop iterates through all the user input integers, placing each in the variable C<$input_index>.X<br>

Inside the C<foreach> loop, the variable C<$input_index> is used to access the individual names inside the variable C<$flintstones_and_rubbles>.X<br>

In Perl, all array indices start at 0 instead of 1, so we must first subtract 1 from C<$input_index> before accessing the individual string elements of C<$flintstones_and_rubbles>.X<br>

Thus, if a user inputs the integer 1, the array index will be 0, which is 'fred'; similarly, user input 5 will access array index 4 which is 'wilma'.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 3, Exercise 3

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the C<sort> and C<chomp> operators.X<br>

In the C<CONSTANTS> section, a constant C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT> is created and set to 0, which will cause the program's output to be displayed on multiple lines.  If C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT> is instead set to 1, the program's output will be displayed on one line.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, a C<while> loop is used to fill the array variable C<$input_strings> with data supplied by the user.X<br>

The C<sort> operator is then called to fill the C<$input_strings_sorted> array with the same data in ASCII alphabetical order.X<br>

Last, a C<foreach> loop is used to print the sorted output by storing and accessing one string at a time in the variable C<$input_strings_sorted_element>.X<br>

An C<if> conditional statement inside the C<foreach> loop tests the constant C<SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT>; if the condition is true, then the C<chomp> operator is called to remove the newline character from each string element and replace it with a normal blank space character, thereby displaying all the elements on a single line of output.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 4, Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with user-defined subroutines.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, one subroutine C<total()> is defined, which accepts as input one argument variable C<$input_numbers> of type C<number_arrayref>, and which also has a C<number> return value stored in the variable C<$retval>.X<br>

Inside the C<total()> subroutine, the return value is initialized to 0 in C<$retval>, then a C<foreach> loop iteratively adds the elements of the array C<$input_numbers> to C<$retval>, after which the value of C<$retval> is returned to original external caller of C<total()>.X<br>

By itself, a subroutine such as C<total()> does not actually do anything; every subroutine must first be called either by some other subroutine or in the C<OPERATIONS> section.X<br>

In C<OPERATIONS>, a 5-element array is created and stored in the variable C<$fred>, which is then passed as input to the subroutine C<total()>, and the return value is displayed using the variable C<$fred_total> and the C<print> operator.X<br>

Next, a C<while> loop and C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> are used to collect user input strings, which are then converted to numeric data values using the C<string_to_number()> subroutine, and stored in the array C<$input_numbers> using the C<push> operator.X<br>

Finally, the subroutine C<total()> is called a second time, now with the variable C<$input_numbers> passed as the input argument, and the return value is displayed using the variable C<$user_total>.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 4, Exercise 2

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the C<..> range operator.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, the same subroutine C<total()> is defined as in the previous exercise.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, an array of numbers is created and stored in the variable C<$one_to_one_thousand>.X<br>

Upon execution, there will be 1,000 number elements in the array, which are automatically created by the C<..> range operator.X<br>

The actual elements stored the array variable C<$one_to_one_thousand> start with C<[1, 2, 3, 4> and end with C<997, 998, 999, 1_000]>.X<br>

Finally, the subroutine C<total()> is called with C<$one_to_one_thousand> passed as the input argument, and the return value is displayed using the variable C<$one_to_one_thousand_total>.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 4, Exercise 3

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with calling user-defined subroutines from one another.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 3 subroutines are defined: C<total()> (same as previous exercises), C<average()>, and C<above_average()>.X<br>

Inside the subroutine C<average()> is a call to the subroutine C<total()>; there is also a call to the C<scalar> operator, which returns the count of elements inside the array C<$input_numbers>.  When the return value of C<total()> is divided by that of C<scalar>, the result is computation of the numeric mean (average) of all elements of C<$input_numbers>.X<br>

Inside C<above_average()> is a call to the subroutine C<average()>, with the return value stored in the variable C<$average>.  An empty array is created in the variable C<$retval>, then a C<foreach> loop iterates over all elements in C<$input_numbers> and an C<if> conditional statement makes a copy of all elements which are greater-than C<$average>.  All above-average elements are returned as an array in C<$retval>.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, 2 arrays are created in the C<$fred> and C<$barney> variables, which are then passed as input arguments to 2 calls to the subroutine C<above_average()>, and the results are displayed.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 4, Exercise 4

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with program state.X<br>

As a program executes, there may be one or more variables in the C<OPERATIONS> section which store information that is important to the overall program; these variables are collectively known as the I<"state"> of the program.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, a string variable C<$previous_name> is created and set to the empty string C<q{}>; this 1 variable is the state of the program.X<br>

Each of the 4 following lines in the C<OPERATIONS> section utilize the program state by both reading from and writing to the variable C<$previous_name>; the calls to the subroutine C<greet()> read from C<$previous_name> as the 2nd argument, and the return value of C<greet()> is then written to C<$previous_name> by the C<=> assignment operator.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<greet()> is defined which accepts 2 string arguments, the variables C<$name> and C<$previous_name>.X<br>

Inside C<greet()>, a personalized greeting is displayed for the virtual person represented by the variable C<$name>, after which an C<if() else> conditional statement checks if there is any data inside C<$previous_name> and further displays a customized comment about the state of the program.  The state variable C<$previous_name> is used to represent the very simple state of virtual people who have already been greeted.X<br>

Finally, the string variable C<$name> is returned from C<greet()> and passed to the C<=> assignment operators in the C<OPERATIONS> section, thereby updating the program state variable C<$previous_name> to contain the value of C<$name>.X<br>

The goal of this exercise is to become further familiarized with program state.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, the state variable C<$previous_names> is an array of strings representing all previous virtual people who have been greeted.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, the subroutine C<greet()> prints the names of previously-greeted virtual people on one line, separated by spaces, by using the C<join> operator.X<br>

Finally, the current value of C<$name> is appended as the last element of the array C<$previous_names> by the C<push> operator, and C<$previous_names> is then returned by C<greet()> to update the program state.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 5, Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with file test operators, as well as opening, closing, and reading from a file.X<br>

In the C<CRITICS> section, the C<ProhibitPostfixControls> critic is disabled due to a bug in Perl::Critic and/or PPI which causes a false error.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<tac()> is defined which accepts as input an array of file names received via the operating system's command-line arguments, and which has a C<void> return value, meaning there is no return value for this subroutine.X<br>

Inside C<tac()>, the C<reverse> operator is called to reverse the order of the command-line arguments; for example, if the 3 file names C<fred barney betty> are given as command-line arguments, then C<reverse> causes the 3 strings C<betty barney fred> to be stored in the array variable C<$command_line_arguments>.X<br>

The outer C<foreach> loop iterates through each C<$file_name> in the now-reversed C<$command_line_arguments>.X<br>

Next, 4 file test operators are called, to ensure each input file exists via C<-e>, is readable via C<-r>, is a regular (not special device) file via C<-f>, and is comprised of plain text via C<-T>.X<br>

The operator C<open> is called with the C<E<lt>> file input (read-only) argument, which opens each C<$file_name> for reading via the C<$FILE> filehandle variable.X<br>

The inner C<while> loop reads in all lines from the current C<$FILE> filehandle using the C<E<lt>$FILEE<gt>> syntax (similar to C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>>) and stores the input file's lines in the string array variable C<$file_lines>; then, the C<reverse> operator is called again to reverse the order of the newly-read file lines.X<br>

Finally, the inner C<foreach> loop displays the now-reversed C<$file_lines>, and the C<close> operator is called to close the C<$FILE> filehandle so no more file access will occur for the current C<$file_name>.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, the C<tac()> subroutine is called with its only argument being a reference to the special C<@ARGV> array, which is Perl's way of accessing the command-line arguments.X<br>

Before executing this program, the non-Perl C<`printf`> program must be called to populate some test data into the 3 input files F<fred>, F<barney>, and F<betty>; and after execution the C<`rm`> program is called to delete the 3 input files.X<br>

To begin execution of this program via the C<`rperl`> command, the program name and input file names must be enclosed in either C<'single-quotes'> or C<"double-quotes">; this tells RPerl the input file names are command-line arguments to be passed to the 1 specified program, instead of specifying additional RPerl programs.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 5, Exercise 2

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the string C<length> operator and basic text formatting.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<right_justify_20()> is defined, which accepts no input arguments and returns no values.X<br>

Inside C<right_justify_20()>, an empty array of strings is initialized in the C<$input_strings> variable, which is then populated with strings in a C<while> loop collecting user input from C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>>.X<br>

The C<x> string repeat operator is called to create a 60-character-wide horizontal ruler, which is then displayed by the C<print> operator.X<br>

Finally, a C<foreach> loop iterates through each C<$input_string> and calls the C<length> operator, thereby determining the correct number of spaces to prepend in order to achieve right justification alignment to the 20th character column.  The C<-> subtraction operator is passed a hard-coded column width of 20, and the C<chomp> operator is called to remove any trailing newline characters which may be appended when the user presses the ENTER key after each input word.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, the only operation is a call to the C<right_justify_20()> subroutine.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 5, Exercise 3

The goal of this exercise is to become further familiarized with basic text formatting.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<right_justify_variable()> is defined, which accepts no input arguments and returns no values.X<br>

Inside C<right_justify_variable()>, the user is prompted to input a custom right justify width, stored in the integer variable C<$column_width>.X<br>

The integer variable C<$ruler_width_tens> is used to determine the number of characters displayed for the ruler, by tens; the default value for C<$ruler_width_tens> is 6, which means a ruler width of 60 characters.  If the user-supplied C<$column_width> is greater-than 60, we scale it by 1/10 and add 1, thereby creating a new value for C<$ruler_width_tens> which will always display a ruler wider than C<$column_width>.X<br> 

When the ruler is displayed, C<$ruler_width_tens> is passed to the C<x> string repeat operator instead of a hard-coded value of 6; likewise, when each C<$input_string> is right justified, the C<-> subtraction operator is passed C<$column_width> instead of a hard-coded value of 20.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, the only operation is a call to the C<right_justify_variable()> subroutine.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 6, Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with hash data structures and hash operators.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<given_to_family_name()> is defined, which accepts no input arguments and returns no values.X<br>

Inside C<given_to_family_name()>, a hash data structure is created in the variable C<$names>.  Another term for hash is associative array, because each hash is comprised of key-value pairs, and we say there is a value "associated" with every key.  Hash keys are bare words and must be unique, while hash values may be any specified data type and need not be unique.  The 3 keys in C<$names> are fred, barney, and wilma; the value of the key fred is 'flintstone'.X<br>

A first name is collected from the user by C<E<lt>STDINE<gt>> and stored in C<$given_name>, then the C<chomp> operator is called to remove the trailing newline recorded when the user presses the ENTER key.X<br>

An C<if> conditional statement calls the C<exists> and C<defined> operators to ensure the user has entered a valid hash key, and an error is returned if there is no such key in the C<$names> hash.X<br>

Finally, the thin-arrow syntax C<$names-E<gt>{$given_name}> is used to retrieve the hash value, and C<print> is called to display the family name outputs.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, the only operation is a call to the C<given_to_family_name()> subroutine.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<unique_word_count()> is defined, which accepts no input arguments and returns no values.X<br>

In C<unique_word_count()>, an empty hash of integer values is created in the variable C<$word_counts>; a C<while> loop then collects user input strings, inside of which an C<if() else> conditional statement updates the C<$word_counts> hash.  If a word is seen for the first time, then the corresponding C<$word_counts> hash value will be set to 1, otherwise the count value will be incremented by 1.X<br>

Finally, a C<foreach> loop iterates through the alphabetically-sorted keys of the C<$word_counts> hash by calling the C<sort> and C<keys> operators, then the thin-arrow hash value retrieval syntax C<$word_counts-E<gt>{$unique_word}> is called, and the C<print> operator displays the word count outputs.X<br>

=head2 Chapter 6, Exercise 3

The goal of this exercise is to become further familiarized with hash data structures and basic text formatting.X<br>

In the C<SUBROUTINES> section, 1 subroutine C<sort_env_vars()> is defined, which accepts no input arguments and returns no values.X<br>

Inside C<sort_env_vars()>, a hash of strings is created in the variable C<$env_vars>, and it is initialized to contain the values of the special C<%ENV> system hash, which stores the current user's environmental variables.X<br>

Next, 2 integer variables C<$env_var_length> and C<$left_column_width> are created, and C<$left_column_width> is initialized to the value 0.  A C<foreach> loop iterates through all environmental variables, measuring the string length of each C<$env_var> by the C<length> operator, and using an C<if> conditional statement to test if the current C<$env_var_length> is greater-than the existing C<$left_column_width>.  If C<$env_var_length> is large enough, then C<$left_column_width> is updated, thereby resulting in the value of C<$left_column_width> being equal to the longest C<$env_var_length>.X<br>

After the C<foreach> loop, C<$left_column_width> is incremented by an additional 2 character widths, allowing for 2 or more spaces between the hash keys and their respective values when displayed.X<br>

Finally, there is another C<foreach> loop below the first, again iterating through all C<$env_vars>, and printing the keys at the beginning of each output line.  The C<-> subtraction operator is called to find the difference between the current key length and the pre-calculated C<$left_column_width>, then the C<x> string repeat operator is called to create the corresponding number of blank spaces as padding between the key and its value.  The thin-arrow hash value retrieval syntax C<$env_vars-E<gt>{$env_var}> is called, and the C<print> operator displays the hash value outputs.X<br>

In the C<OPERATIONS> section, the only operation is a call to the C<sort_env_vars()> subroutine.X<br>

=head1 APPENDIX B: RPERL COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS

The C<`rperl`> I<"command-line interface"> (CLI) is a software program which serves as the primary front-end user interface for RPerl.  When called for execution, the C<`rperl`> command must be provided with at least one input file name, which tells RPerl which file(s) to compile.  In addition, C<`rperl`> may also be provided with one or more optional I<"command-line arguments">, which tell RPerl how to behave and exactly how to compile the input file(s).  Command-line arguments are also commonly referred to as I<"options">, or in this specific context just I<"arguments">.

Command-line arguments which are listed as one of the I<"modes"> will modify the way RPerl compiles the input source code file(s).  All RPerl modes are written using the longhand format:

C<--mode foo=BAR>

Arguments which are listed as one of the I<"flags"> are written using the shorthand C<--foo> or even shorter C<-f> formats.  Most flags are shortcuts to common modes.

Flags and other non-mode arguments which are not shortcuts to common modes will either modify some non-compiling behavior of RPerl (such as enabling additional information output), or cause RPerl to do something other than fully execute and compile input source code files (such as displaying version information then exiting).

Below is a comprehensive list of all RPerl command-line arguments, as reported by the S<C<`rperl -?`>> command.

Additional explanations for each argument are provided I<with emphasis.>

=head2 B.1: Help

=over

=item B<--help ...OR... -h ...OR... -?>

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Print this (relatively) brief help message for command-line usage.
    For additional explanations, run the command `perldoc RPerl::Learning` and see Appendix B.

=item B<--vversion ...OR... -vv>

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Print version number and copyright information.
    Repeat as 'vv' for more technical information, similar to `perl -V` configuration summary argument.
    Lowercase 'v' not to be confused with uppercase 'V' in 'Verbose' argument.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The single-v version option displays a brief message similar to the output of the C<`perl -v`> command.>

I<The double-v version option displays a collection of technical information similar to the output of the C<`perl -V`> command, including subcompile flags for the C++ compiler and system paths.  This option may be useful to RPerl system develpers when debugging subcompile issues or other problems.>

=head2 B.3: Input Files

=over

=item B<--infile=MyFile.pm ...OR... -i=MyFile.pm>

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Specify input file, may be repeated for multiple input files.
    Argument prefix '--infile' may be entirely omitted.
    Argument prefix MUST be omitted to specify wildcard for multiple input files.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The input file option tells RPerl which file(s) to compile, and is the only command-line argument which is always required every time the C<`rperl`> command is fully executed (not just C<`rperl -?`>, C<`rperl -v`>, etc).  Even if the argument prefix '--infile' is omitted for convenience, one or more input file names must still be specified to avoid an RPerl error message.>

I<All input files must end in '.pl' for RPerl programs, or '.pm' for RPerl modules.>

=head2 B.4: Output Files

=over

=item B<--outfile=MyCompiledModule ...OR... -o=MyCompiledModule>

=item B<--outfile=my_compiled_program ...OR... -o=my_compiled_program>

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Specify output file prefix, may be repeated for multiple output files.
    RPerl *.pm input file with PERL ops will create MyCompiledModule.pmc output file.
    RPerl *.pl input file with PERL ops will create my_compiled_program (or my_compiled_program.exe on Windows) output file.
    RPerl *.pm input file with CPP  ops will create MyCompiledModule.pmc, MyCompiledModule.cpp, & MyCompiledModule.h output files.
    RPerl *.pl input file with CPP  ops will create my_compiled_program (or my_compiled_program.exe on Windows) & my_compiled_program.cpp output files.
    Argument may be entirely omitted, foo.* input file will default to foo.* output file(s).

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The output file option tells RPerl which file(s) to generate by specifying a file prefix.  RPerl automatically determines the output file suffixes, depending upon the operations (AKA "ops") mode of either PERL or CPP.  The PERL ops mode is a test mode, so only Perl output files are generated; the CPP ops mode is a real compile mode, so C++ output files are generated.>

I<If the output file option is omitted, then the original prefix of each input file is used as the prefix of the output file, as one would expect.  For example, without an output file option provided, an input file named 'foo.pl' in CPP ops mode will generate the 'foo.cpp' and 'foo' (or 'foo.exe' in Windows) output files.  With an output file option of C<-o=bar> provided, the same 'foo.pl' input file will instead generate the 'bar.cpp' and 'bar' (or 'bar.exe') output files.>

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The C++ compiler option tells RPerl which subcompiler to use for converting C++ source code into binary machine code.>

I<This option is a shorthand provided for brevity, please see: L</B.17: Modes, C++ Compiler>>

    Specify magic mode, LOW by default.
    If set to LOW, accept low-magic (static) Perl source code in the source code input file(s).
    If set to MEDIUM, accept medium-magic (mostly static) Perl source code in the source code input file(s).
    If set to HIGH, accept high-magic (dynamic) Perl source code in the source code input file(s).
    Because only low-magic mode is supported at this time, this option does not currently have any effect.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The magic mode option tells RPerl which grammar to use when parsing the input source code.>

I<Low-magic parsing uses the Grammar.eyp EYAPP grammar file, medium-magic parsing will uses GrammarMedium.eyp, and high-magic parsing will use GrammarHigh.eyp.>

=over

=item B<--mode code=PERL ...OR... -m code=PERL>

    Specify source code mode, CPP by default.
    If set to PERL, generate Perl source code in the source code output file(s).
    If set to CPP, generate C++ source code in the source code output file(s).
    PERL operations mode forces PERL code mode; CPP operations mode forces CPP code mode.
    Because code mode is dependent upon operations mode, this option does not currently have any effect.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The source code mode option tells RPerl which grammar to use when generating the output source code.>

I<Perl code generating will produce output source code which can be parsed using RPerl itself.>

I<C++ code generating will produce output source code which can be parsed using any standards-compliant C++ compiler.>

=over

=item B<--mode ops=PERL ...OR... -m ops=PERL>

=item B<--mode ops=CPP ...OR... -m ops=CPP>

    Specify operations mode, CPP by default.
    If set to PERL, generate Perl operations in the source code output file(s).
    If set to CPP, generate C++ operations in the source code output file(s).
    PERL ops mode forces PERL types mode & PARSE or GENERATE compile mode; PERLOPS_PERLTYPES is test mode, does not actually compile.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The two most important RPerl modes are "operations" (AKA "ops") and "data types" (AKA "types").>

I<The ops mode option tells RPerl if it should use Perl operations or C++ operations in the final output.  Perl operations are slow, but provide support for high-magic functionality.  C++ operations are fast, but only support low-magic functionality.>

I<Normal Perl is considered an interpreted language and uses Perl operations.  When an RPerl application is run in Perl operations mode, then the application is interpreted instead of compiled.  When an RPerl application runs in C++ operations mode, then it is compiled.>

    If set to PERL, generate Perl data types in the source code output file(s).
    If set to CPP, generate C++ data types in the source code output file(s).
    If set to DUAL, generate both Perl and C++ data types in the source code output file(s).
    DUAL mode allows generate-once-compile-many types, selected by '#define __FOO__TYPES' in lib/rperltypes_mode.h or `gcc -D__FOO__TYPES` manual subcompile argument.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The types mode option tells RPerl if it should use Perl data types or C++ data types in the final output.  Just like RPerl's ops mode, Perl data types are slow and high-magic, while C++ types are fast and low-magic.>

I<Normal interpreted Perl uses Perl types (and Perl ops).  When an RPerl application is run in Perl types mode, then the application is compiled but only partial speed optimization is achieved.  When an RPerl application runs in C++ types mode, then it is compiled with full speed optimization.>

I<Because RPerl's first goal is performance, support for C++-ops-Perl-types mode and C++-ops-dual-types mode is limited to hand-compiled RPerl applications only, with full support planned for a future version release.  Meanwhile, the high-performance C++-ops-C++-types mode is currently supported for compiled RPerl applications, and the slow Perl-ops-Perl-types mode (AKA "test mode") is supported for testing purposes.>

=item B<--mode type_integer=LONG ...OR... -m type_integer=LONG>

=item B<--mode type_integer=LONG__LONG ...OR... -m type_integer=LONG__LONG>

=for rperl X<noncode>

    Specify native C++ integer data type, same as internal Perl type by default.
    If set to LONG, utilize 'long' as native type for 'integer', at least 32 bits;
    If set to LONG__LONG, utilize 'long long' as native type for 'integer', at least 64 bits.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The type_integer mode option tells RPerl which native C++ data type to use as the RPerl 'integer' data type when compiled in CPPOPS_CPPTYPES mode.>

I<According to the C language standard, 'long' will provide at least 32 bits of storage, and 'long long' will provide at least 64 bits.>

    Specify native C++ number data type, same as internal Perl type by default.
    If set to DOUBLE, utilize 'double' as native type for 'number', usually at least 32 bits, but not guaranteed;
    If set to LONG__DOUBLE, utilize 'long double' as native type for 'number', usually at least 64 bits, but not guaranteed.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The type_number mode option tells RPerl which native C++ data type to use as the RPerl 'number' data type when compiled in CPPOPS_CPPTYPES mode.>

I<According to the C language standard, there is no guaranteed bit length for these data types, although 'long double' will not provide less storage than 'double'.>

I<On some systems, 'double' is 32 bits and 'long double' is 64 bits, while on other systems 'double' is 64 bits and 'long double' is 128 bits.  Every system is different, and other bit lengths may also be encountered.>

    Specify data type checking mode, TRACE by default.
    If set to OFF, do not perform dynamic type checking, only built-in C++ static type checking.
    If set to ON, perform dynamic type checking in addition to built-in C++ static type checking.
    If set to TRACE, perform dynamic type checking in addition to built-in C++ static type checking, with subroutine-and-variable trace information.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The data type checking mode option tells RPerl if it should perform additional tests to ensure correct data types are used as "subroutine arguments" (not to be confused with "command-line arguments").  RPerl subroutines can accept 1 or more arguments (AKA "parameters"), each of which must be of a specific data type.>

I<In C++-ops-C++-types mode, all data types must be determined at compile time and thus can not change (AKA "static"), so the C++ compiler performs all necessary type checking.  In any Perl types mode, the data types can not be determined until runtime and thus can change (AKA "dynamic"), so RPerl must itself perform type checking for subroutine arguments.>

I<If the type checking mode is set to TRACE, then the name of the problematic subroutine and argument will be "traced" and provided in the RPerl error message.  This setting can be useful for RPerl application developers and debugging purposes.>

    If set to OFF, do not search for or compile dependencies.
    If set to ON, recursively search for dependencies and subdependencies, include as additional input file(s).
    WARNING: Disabling dependencies will likely cause errors or undefined behavior.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The dependencies mode option tells RPerl if it should compile all the Perl application code which is used by the input RPerl application code via the C<use> operator.  If 1 RPerl application input file is provided which has 10 dependencies, and each of those 10 dependencies has 10 sub-dependencies of its own, then the RPerl compiler actually has at least 111 input files to compile, and possibly many more than 111 if any of the sub-dependencies has sub-sub-dependencies, etc.>

I<If your RPerl application depends upon other RPerl code, then all should go as planned.  If your RPerl application depends upon other non-RPerl code, then you will likely encounter problems as RPerl attempts to compile the non-RPerl components.>

I<If the dependencies mode option is set to OFF, then you will likely encounter problems as the compiled RPerl application attempts to locate the compiled form of each dependency, which will not be found unless manually compiled or copied from a previous compile.  Thus, disabling compilation of dependencies is strongly discouraged, because RPerl will not function properly if any dependency (or sub-dependency, etc) is not compiled.>

    If set to INLINE, delete all generated C++ output Inline::CPP files: _Inline/ directory
    If set to SOURCE_BINARY, delete both SOURCE and BINARY files.
    If set to SOURCE_BINARY_INLINE, delete SOURCE, BINARY, and INLINE files.
    For *.pm Perl module input files, BINARY and INLINE are equivalent.

=for rperl X</noncode>

I<The uncompile mode option tells RPerl if it should do the opposite of compiling, which is to delete any compiled files created by previous executions of RPerl.>

I<Many different files may be created each time RPerl is executed, which are separated into 3 different groups: human-readable RPerl source code files (AKA "SOURCE"), machine-readable RPerl binary files (AKA "BINARY"), and a mixture of both source and binary files created by the Inline software in the "_Inline" directory (AKA "INLINE").  It is recommended to delete all 3 groups using the "SOURCE_BINARY_INLINE" setting, to avoid possible problems with mismatching or partially-compiled components.>

=head1 APPENDIX D: RPERL GRAMMAR

=head2 D.1: Eyapp Grammar Format & Sections

RPerl's grammar is written using the Eyapp computer programming language, which is a combination of normal Perl 5 and grammar expressions.

The grammar expression sections in Eyapp source code are written using an implementation of the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) language.

The file F<lib/RPerl/Grammar.eyp> contains the uncompiled RPerl grammar, which is passed through the C<`eyapp`> compiler command once to generate the output file F<lib/RPerl/Grammar.pm>, which is then used by the C<`rperl`> compiler command to parse RPerl input source code files.

Inside the F<lib/RPerl/Grammar.eyp> file, there are several labeled file sections, which can be grouped into 4 major categories:

=over 16

=item * Eyapp Setup & Config

At the top of the F<Grammar.eyp> file, the C<[[[ EYAPP SETUP & CONFIG ]]]> section contains Perl 5 code to initialize RPerl within the special percent-signs-and-curly-braces C<%{ }%> delimiters, as well as the C<%strict> and C<%tree> Eyapp configuration directives for automatically building an abstract syntax tree (AST) from an RPerl input file.

=item * Lexicon

Near the top of the F<Grammar.eyp> file, multiple C<[[[ LEXICON TOKENS ... ]]]> sections contain all valid RPerl tokens in the form of Perl 5 regular expressions.  The lexicon of a language is synonymous with the language's alphabet and vocabulary; lexical analysis is synonymous with spell checking.

=item * Syntax

In the middle of the F<Grammar.eyp> file, one C<[[[ SYNTAX, OPERATOR PRECEDENCE & ASSOCIATIVITY ]]]> section and multiple C<[[[ SYNTAX PRODUCTION RULES ... ]]]> sections define all relationships between all RPerl tokens, as well as all valid combinations of RPerl tokens.  The syntax of a language is synonymous with the rules of constructing valid sentences, and syntactic analysis is synonymous with grammar checking.

=item * Semantics

Near the top of the F<Grammar.eyp> file, the C<[[[ SEMANTIC ACTION, ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE NODE CONSTRUCTOR ]]]> section creates new Perl 5 objects (blessed hash references) to be used as nodes when constructing an AST; at the bottom of the file, the C<[[[ SEMANTIC MAP, ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE NODES TO CLASSES ]]]> section contains a 1-to-1 mapping from AST nodes to RPerl objects.  The Perl module file for each of the RPerl objects contains subroutines implementing the semantic actions which actually generate and/or execute output code.  The semantics of a language are synonymous with the meaning of words and sentences; in computer programming languages, semantic actions are the tasks which the computer source code performs when executed.

=head2 D.2: Lexicon Token Types

Following is a list of all RPerl tokens in all 4 lexicon sections, along with examples of valid matching lexeme input.

The list must be in correct order for all regexes to match; earlier declarations get tried first, thus highly-specific tokens such as RPerl keywords and built-in operators appear first, while the least-specific tokens such as user-defined words appear last.  This ordering can be considered I<"lexical matching">, and is distinct from operator precedence and associativity as covered in the next section.

=head2 D.3: Syntax Arity, Fixity, Precedence, Associativity

Operator I<"arity"> is a technical term which means the number of input operands accepted by a specific built-in operator, or the number of input arguments accepted by a user-defined subroutine.  An operator or function which accepts 0 input arguments is known as I<"nullary">, 1 argument as I<"unary">, 2 arguments as I<"binary">, 3 arguments as I<"ternary">, and so forth.  The C<exit;> operator may be called as nullary; the C<++> increment operator is unary; the C<+> addition operator is binary; and the C<substr> operator may be called as ternary.  Not to be confused with "a ternary operator", meaning any operator which accepts 3 operands, there is one specific operator known as I<"the ternary operator">, which is a special kind of conditional operator accepting 3 input arguments.  An operator or function which may accept more than one number of arguments is known as I<"variadic">.  Some RPerl operators are variadic, such as C<substr> which may accept 2, 3, or 4 arguments.  RPerl does not currently support variadic user-defined subroutine.

L<Operator Arity on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity>

Operator I<"fixity"> is the notation form indicating the location of an operator when placed relative to its own input operands.  I<"Prefix"> operators are located before their operands, I<"infix"> between operands, and I<"postfix"> after operands.  Additionally, operators which must be placed both before and after their operands are said to be of I<"closed"> fixity (AKA I<"closefix">), while operators capable of more than one placement location are called I<"mixfix">.  Prefix notation is also known as I<"Polish notation">, and postfix is called I<"Reverse Polish"> notation.  The C<abs> absolute value is a prefix operator; the C<+> addition operator is infix; and the C<++> increment operator can be called as postfix.  The C<-( )> negative-with-parentheses operator is of closed fixity, because the parentheses component must appear both before and after the enclosed operand.  Parentheses are always of closed fixity; in normal Perl, the C<-> negative (without parentheses) is a prefix operator, but in RPerl we only allow the closed fixity C<-( )> negative-with-parentheses operator in order to avoid grammar ambiguity, because the same C<-> dash (AKA hyphen) character is utilized for both the C<-> negative and C<-> subtraction operators.  The C<++> increment operator may also be called as prefix, so it may be classified as mixfix.

L<Prefix Notation on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_notation>

L<Infix Notation on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation>

L<Postfix Notation on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_notation>

Operator I<"precedence">, also known as I<"order-of-operations">, is a methodology used to determine which operator is executed first when 2 or more operators are adjacent to one another and parentheses are not used to explicitly separate them.  A numeric precedence from 1 to 24 is assigned to each operator, and the operator with the lowest precedence number is given priority to execute first.  Low precedence number equals high priority.  The C<*> arithmetic multiplication operator has a precedence number of 7, and C<+> addition has a precedence of 8, so C<a + b * c> is equivalent to C<a + (b * c)>, not C<(a + b) * c>.

L<Operator Precedence on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_precedence>

Operator I<"associativity"> is used to further determine precedence when multiple operators of the same priority are adjacent to one another.  Each operator is designated as left-associative, right-associative, or non-associative.  (Wikipedia incorrectly identifies associativity as a synonym for fixity, which is different, as described above.)  Normal arithmetic operators are left-associative, meaning C<a - b - c> is equivalent to C<(a - b) - c>, not C<a - (b - c)>.  Some operators such as mathematic power (AKA exponentiation) are right-associative, meaning C<a ** b ** c> is equivalent to C<a ** (b ** c)>.  Operators which are not meant to be chained together are non-associative, such as the C<..> list range operator which takes scalar values as input but generates an array as output, so C<a .. b .. c> is incorrect usage and will cause an error.

L<Operator Associativity on Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity>

In the following list of operators copied directly from F<Grammar.eyp>, later declaration gets higher priority, so all precedence numbers appear in strictly descending order from 24 to 1.  (Implementation of operator arity and fixity are a bit less straightforward, and are not easily copied-and-pasted in one succinct list directly out of F<Grammar.eyp>.)  All operator arity, fixity, precedence, and associativity are taken directly from Perl 5.

=head2 D.4: Syntax Production Rules

The EBNF metasyntax implemented by Eyapp is of the form:

C<ProductionRule: First Alternative 'foo' | Second Alternative 'bar' | ... | Last Alternative 'quux' ;>

In this example, C<ProductionRule> is a non-terminal left-hand-side (LHS) symbol, is followed by the C<:> reduction metasymbol, and may be reduced (replaced) by any of the right-hand-side (RHS) sequences of terminal and non-terminal symbols, themselves separated by the C<|> alternation (logical or) metasymbol.  In other words, each LHS may become any of its corresponding RHS alternatives.

Terminal symbols are enclosed in single-quotes as with C<'foo'>, never appear on the LHS, and are taken as literal data with no transformations applied.  Eyapp treats terminal symbols as tokens which only match one hard-coded lexeme, which is the string appearing inside the single-quotes, C<foo> in this example.
