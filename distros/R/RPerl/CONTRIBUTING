The Work hereby assigned shall also include any future versions of these or any other Contributions hereafter made by You.  Any derivative works of this Contribution prepared by You or Team RPerl shall be solely owned by Braswell and shall remain part of the RPerl Family.

You hereby agree that if You have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the software or documentation contributed to by the Work (or use of that software or documentation), such dominating interest shall not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e. Braswell and all subsequent licensees shall be licensed to use, in that software or documentation and their derivative works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating interest.

<<<=== LEGAL OVERVIEW ===>>>

All RPerl Family software and documentation is legally copyrighted by original RPerl creator William N. Braswell, Jr.

To maintain the legal integrity and defensibility of the RPerl Family of software and documentation, all contributors to the RPerl Family must assign copyright ownership to William Braswell under the terms of the RPerl Family Copyright Assignment Agreement above, thereby empowering him to pursue legal action against those who attempt to violate any RPerl Family copyright, license, or other intellectual property rights.

This is the same strategy used by the Free Software Foundation for many GNU software projects, as explained below:

Why The FSF Gets Copyright Assignments From Contributors
By Professor Eben Moglen, Columbia University Law School
Copyright Â© 2001, 2008, 2009, 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

"Under US copyright law, which is the law under which most free software programs have historically been first published, there are very substantial procedural advantages to registration of copyright.  And despite the broad right of distribution conveyed by the GPL, enforcement of copyright is generally not possible for distributors: only the copyright holder or someone having assignment of the copyright can enforce the license.  If there are multiple authors of a copyrighted work, successful enforcement depends on having the cooperation of all authors.

In order to make sure that all of our copyrights can meet the recordkeeping and other requirements of registration, and in order to be able to enforce the GPL most effectively, FSF requires that each author of code incorporated in FSF projects provide a copyright assignment, and, where appropriate, a disclaimer of any work-for-hire ownership claims by the programmer's employer.  That way we can be sure that all the code in FSF projects is free code, whose freedom we can most effectively protect, and therefore on which other developers can completely rely."


<<<=== COMMITMENT TO FREE & OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE ===>>>

William Braswell is committed to maintaining the free-and-open-source software (FOSS) basis of the RPerl Family.

If your RPerl Family contribution is accepted and merged into an official RPerl Family source repository, then your contribution is automatically published online with FOSS licensing, currently the same terms as Perl itself (your choice of Artistic or GNU GPL licenses).  


<<<=== EMPLOYER COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER AGREEMENT ===>>>

The file named EMPLOYERS.pdf contains the Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement.  If you are employed or work as an independent contractor, and either your job involves computer programming or you have executed an agreement giving your employer or contractee rights to the software you create, then we must receive a fully-executed copy of the EMPLOYERS agreement.  Please print the file on one page of paper, and use blue ink to clearly write the entity's full name and address, followed by your full legal name.  Then, have a vice president or general manager in your organization use blue ink to write the date, their full legal name and organizational title, and sign their signature.  You may then submit the fully-executed EMPLOYERS document either in original paper form via snail mail (preferable), or a high-resolution digital scanned copy via e-mail.  If possible, please execute (sign) the EMPLOYERS document in the presence of an official Notary Public, and have them notarize the appropriate area at the bottom of the document.


<<<=== OTHER CONTRIBUTORS ===>>>

If anyone other than yourself has written software source code or documentation as part of your RPerl Family contribution, then they must submit their contributions themselves under the terms of the RPerl Family Copyright Assignment Agreement above, and their respective employer(s) or contractee(s) must also all sign and submit their own copies of the Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement.

Please be sure you DO NOT STUDY OR INCLUDE any 3rd-party or public-domain intellectual property as part of your RPerl Family contribution, including but not limited to: source code; documentation; copyrighted, trademarked, or patented components; or technical concepts.  In other words, don't copy someone else's work and don't study someone else's work while doing your own.  All your work must be 100% original.


<<<=== RECOGNITION ===>>>

Once we have received your contribution under the terms of the RPerl Family Copyright Assignment Agreement above, as well as any necessary Employer Copyright Disclaimer Agreement(s), then we will begin the process of reviewing any software pull requests you have submitted through the official RPerl Family repositories.  Upon merging of your pull request(s), you should automatically be listed in the repository as one of the official Team RPerl contributors, and you will also be manually added to the AUTHORS file.


<<<=== SUBMISSION ===>>>

When you are ready to submit the signed agreement(s), please answer the following 12 questions about yourself and your RPerl Family contribution, then include your answers in the body of your e-mail or on a separate sheet of paper in snail mail, and send it all to one of the addresses below.
