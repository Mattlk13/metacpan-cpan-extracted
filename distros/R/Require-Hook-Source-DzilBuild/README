NAME
    Require::Hook::Source::DzilBuild - Load module source code from
    Dist::Zilla build files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of
    Require::Hook::Source::DzilBuild (from Perl distribution
    Require-Hook-Source-DzilBuild), released on 2022-07-16.

SYNOPSIS
    In your Dist::Zilla plugin, e.g. in "munge_files()":

     sub munge_files {
         my $self = shift;

         local @INC = (Require::Hook::Source::DzilBuild->new(zilla => $self->zilla), @INC);
         require Foo::Bar; # will be searched from build files, if exist

         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This is the Require::Hook version of the same functionality found in
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild.

    It looks for files from "lib/" and "." of Dist::Zilla build files.

METHODS
  new(%args) => obj
    Constructor. Known arguments:

    *   die => bool (default: 0)

        If set to 1, will die if filename to be "require()"-d does not exist
        in build files. Otherwise if set to false (the default) will simply
        decline if file is not found in build files.

    *   debug => bool

        If set to 1, will print more debug stuffs to STDERR.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
