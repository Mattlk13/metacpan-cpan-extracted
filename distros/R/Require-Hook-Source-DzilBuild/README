VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Require::Hook::Source::DzilBuild (from Perl distribution
    Require-Hook-Source-DzilBuild), released on 2020-11-13.

SYNOPSIS
    In your Dist::Zilla plugin, e.g. in "munge_files()":

     sub munge_files {
         my $self = shift;

         local @INC = (Require::Hook::Source::DzilBuild->new(zilla => $self->zilla), @INC);
         require Foo::Bar; # will be searched from build files, if exist

         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This is the Require::Hook version of the same functionality found in
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild.

    It looks for files from "lib/" and "." of Dist::Zilla build files.

METHODS
  new(%args) => obj
    Constructor. Known arguments:

    *   die => bool (default: 0)

        decline if file is not found in build files.
