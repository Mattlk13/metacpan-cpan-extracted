FUNCTIONS
  list_git_release_tags
    Usage:

     list_git_release_tags(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List git release tags.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         list_git_release_tags(detail => 1, release_tag_regex => "^release");

    It's common to tag a release with something like:

     v1.2.3

    This routine returns a list of them.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   release_tag_regex => *re* (default:
        qr(\A(?^:(?:(?:version|ver|v|release|rel)[_-]?)?\d)))

        Regex to match a release tag.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  list_git_release_years
    Usage:

     list_git_release_years(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List git release years.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         list_git_release_years(detail => 1, regex => "^release");

    This routine uses list_git_release_tags() to collect the release tags
    and their dates, then group them by year.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   release_tag_regex => *re* (default:
        qr(\A(?^:(?:(?:version|ver|v|release|rel)[_-]?)?\d)))
