NAME
    Role::TinyCommons::BinarySearch::LinesInHandle - Provide has_item() that
    uses binary search

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Role::TinyCommons::BinarySearch::LinesInHandle (from Perl distribution
    Role-TinyCommons-BinarySearch-LinesInHandle), released on 2021-05-07.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
REQUIRED METHODS
  fh
    Must return the filehandle.

OPTIONALLY DEPENDED METHODS
  fh_min_offset
    Must return the minimum position (in bytes) to search the filehandle
    from.

    If this method is not supported by object, 0 will be assumed.

  fh_max_offset
    Must return the maximum position (in bytes) to search the filehandle to.
    Can also return "undef", in which case the filehandle will be
    "stat()"-ed to find out the size of the file.

    If this method is not supported by object, the filehandle will also be
    "stat()"-ed.

  cmp_items
    Usage:

     my $res = $obj->cmp_items($item1, $item2); # 0|-1|1

    Must return 0, -1, or 1 like Perl's "cmp" or "<=>" operator. Note that
    Role::TinyCommons::Collection::CompareItems also uses this method.

PROVIDED METHODS
  has_item
    Usage:

     my $has_item = $obj->has_item($item); # bool

    Return true if $item is found in the filehandle (searched using binary
    search), false otherwise.

    Note that the Role::TinyCommons::Collection::FindItem role also uses
    this method.
