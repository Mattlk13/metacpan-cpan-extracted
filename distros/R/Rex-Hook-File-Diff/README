    version v0.1.0

SYNOPSIS

        use Rex::Hook::File::Diff;

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows Rex to show a diff of changes for the files managed
    via its built-in file manipulation commands
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File> which rely on the file
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#file> command as a
    backend:

    file <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#file>

    delete_lines_matching
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#delete_lines_matching>

    delete_lines_according_to
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#delete_lines_according_to>

    append_if_no_such_line
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#append_if_no_such_line>

    append_or_amend_line
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#append_or_amend_line>

    sed <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#sed>

DIAGNOSTICS

    environment variables.

INCOMPATIBILITIES

    There are no known incompatibilities with other modules.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    There are no known bugs. Make sure they are reported.

    Currently the module supports local file operations only.

    Upload hook support is not implemented (yet), so diff is not shown upon
    file uploads when using the source option with the file
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::File#file> command (or the
    upload <https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::Upload#upload> command
    directly).
