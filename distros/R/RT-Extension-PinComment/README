NAME
    RT::Extension::PinComment - Add a "pin comment" feature to tickets

DESCRIPTION
    This extension adds the facility to pin a comment on a ticket, so it is
    highlighted and always comes first in the transaction history.

    As well as adding a "*Pin*" action to ticket transactions, this
    extension also provides a format field "*PinComment*" in the query
    builder for showing the contents of a ticket's pinned comment, and a
    search option "*Has a pinned comment*" to find tickets with pinned
    comments.

    An operator requires the *ModifyTicket* right on a ticket to change
    which comment is pinned on it.

RT VERSION
    Known to work with RT 4.2.16, 4.4.4, and 5.0.1.
