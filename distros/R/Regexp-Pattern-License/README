NAME
    Regexp::Pattern::License - Regular expressions for legal licenses

VERSION
    Version v3.1.92

DESCRIPTION
    Regexp::Pattern::License provides a hash of regular expression patterns
    related to legal software licenses.

    Regexp::Pattern is a convention for organizing reusable regex patterns.

PATTERNS
  Single licenses
    Patterns each covering a single license.

    Each of these patterns has exactly one of these tags: type:singleversion:*
    type:unversioned type:versioned:decimal .

STRUCTURE
    The regexp patterns follows the DefHash specification, and more
    specifically the structure of Regexp::Pattern, defining access to one
    pattern per DefHash object, as `pat`.

    Additionally, (sub)patterns are available in plaintext form, as
    `pat.alt.*`.

  SUBJECT
    Each pattern targets one or more subjects, i.e. ways to directly or
    indirectly represent a license.

    Beware that not all pattern objects fully cover all subjects.

    trait
        Distinguishing trait or feature expressed in licensing strings, e.g.
        an advertising clause or granting "...or any later version."

        Coverage for this subject is currently rather weak.

    name
        Distinguishing name, e.g. usable in license grant.

    grant
        Text granting the license.

    license
        Text containing licensing terms.

        Texts containing both license grant and licensing terms (e.g. BSD- and
        MIT-style licensing) may be classified as either subject grant or
        subject license. This may change, as needs for distinction is better
        understood.

  SCOPE
    Each pattern can process material within some scope, i.e. a certain sample
    size of the full subject.

    As an example, <https://codesearch.debian.net/> use line-based processing,
    where patterns spanning multiple lines are not applicable.

    line
        Pattern typically found within a single line. Typically this means
        less than 70 characters within scope.

    sentence
        Pattern matching within a sentence.

        May span multiple lines, but not across multiple sentences. Typically
        this means no full-stop or colon within scope.

    paragraph
        Pattern matching distinguishing paragraph.

        May span multiple sentences, but not multiple paragraphs. Typically
        this means no newline within scope.

    section
        Pattern matching distinguishing section.

        May span multiple paragraphs, but not multiple sections. Typically
        this means blank line within scope.

    multisection
        Pattern may span multiple sections.

  TAGS
    Pattern defhashes optionally includes tags, which may help in selecting
    multiple related patterns.

    Tags are hierarchical, with `:` as separator, and may be extended without
    notice. Therefore take care to permit sub-parts when tag-matching, e.g.
    using a regex like ` /\Asome:tag(?:\z|:)/ `.

    *   family:bsd

    *   family:cc

    *   family:gpl

    *   family:mit

    *   family:zlib

        Pattern covers a license part of a family of licenses.

    *   type:combo

        Pattern covers a combination of multiple licenses.

    *   type:group

        Pattern covers either of multiple licenses.

    *   type:singleversion:*

        Pattern covers a specific version of a license.

        Last part of tag is the key of the corresponding non-version-specific
        pattern.

    *   type:trait

        Pattern covers a single trait occuring in licenses.

    *   type:unversioned

        Pattern covers a license without versioning scheme.

    *   type:versioned:decimal

        Pattern covers a license using decimal number versioning scheme.

   DEPRECATED TAGS
    Tags not documented in this POD, specifically non-hierarchical tags, are
    deprecated and will be dropped in a future release.
