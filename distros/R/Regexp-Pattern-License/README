STRUCTURE
    The regexp patterns follows the DefHash specification, and more
    specifically the structure of Regexp::Pattern.

  TAGS
    Pattern defhashes optionally includes tags, which may help in selecting
    multiple related patterns.

    Tags are hierarchical, with `:` as separator, and may be extended without
    notice. Therefore take care to permit sub-parts when tag-matching, e.g.
    using a regex like ` /\Asome:tag(?:\z|:)/ `.

    *   family:bsd

    *   family:cc

    *   family:gpl

    *   family:mit

    *   family:zlib

        Pattern covers a license part of a family of licenses.

    *   type:combo

        Pattern covers a combination of multiple licenses.

    *   type:group

        Pattern covers either of multiple licenses.

    *   type:singleversion:*

        Pattern covers a specific version of a license.

        Last part of tag is the key of the corresponding non-version-specific
        pattern.

    *   type:trait

        Pattern covers a single trait occuring in licenses.

    *   type:unversioned

        Pattern covers a license without versioning scheme.

    *   type:versioned:decimal

        Pattern covers a license using decimal number versioning scheme.

   DEPRECATED TAGS
    Tags not documented in this POD, specifically non-hierarchical tags, are
    deprecated and will be dropped in a future release.
