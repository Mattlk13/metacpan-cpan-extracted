    API changes:
    * Ryu::Exception->future renamed to ->as_future, old method is

0.004     2017-01-16 02:34:22+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    API changes:
    * ->await now returns the source, not the completion Future.

    * ->await didn't, instead it delegated to Future's ->await which provides
    no guarantees about readiness when it returns. Fixed by looping until the
    Future is ready.
