# General

I am always open to improvements and suggestions. Use
[issues](https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/issues)

# Style

I will never accept pull request that do not strictly conform to my
style, however you might hate it. You can read the reasoning behind
my [preferences](http://tux.nl/style.html).

I really do not care about mixed spaces and tabs in (leading) whitespace

Perl::Tidy will help getting the code in shape, but as all software, it
is not perfect. You can find my preferences for these in
[.perltidy](./.perltidyrc) and [.perlcritic](./.perlcriticrc).

# Requirements

As this is a document-only release, there are no requirements.
