NAME
    Require::Hook::Source::MetaCPAN - Load module source code from MetaCPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Require::Hook::Source::MetaCPAN
    (from Perl distribution Require-Hook-Source-MetaCPAN), released on
    2022-11-15.

SYNOPSIS
     {
         local @INC = (@INC, Require::Hook::Source::MetaCPAN->new);
         require Foo::Bar; # will be searched from MetaCPAN
         # ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Warning: this is most probably not suitable for use in production or
    real-world code.

METHODS
  new([ %args ]) => obj
    Constructor. Known arguments:

    *   die

        Bool. Default is true.

        If set to 1 (the default) will die if module source code can't be
        fetched (e.g. the module does not exist on CPAN, or there is network
        error). If set to 0, will simply decline so "require()" will try the
        next entry in @INC.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
