NAME
    Require::Hook::Source::MetaCPAN - Load module source code from MetaCPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Require::Hook::Source::MetaCPAN
    (from Perl distribution Require-Hook-Source-MetaCPAN), released on
    2020-11-13.

SYNOPSIS
     {
         local @INC = (@INC, Require::Hook::Source::MetaCPAN->new);
         require Foo::Bar; # will be searched from MetaCPAN
         # ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Warning: this is most probably not suitable for use in production or
    real-world code.

METHODS
  new([ %args ]) => obj
    Constructor. Known arguments:

    *   die

        Bool. Default is true.

        If set to 1 (the default) will die if module source code can't be
        fetched (e.g. the module does not exist on CPAN, or there is network
        error). If set to 0, will simply decline so "require()" will try the
        next entry in @INC.
