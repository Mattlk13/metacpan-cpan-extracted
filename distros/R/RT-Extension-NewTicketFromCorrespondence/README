NAME
    RT::Extension::NewTicketFromCorrespondence - Make new tickets from
    correspondence

DESCRIPTION
    This extension adds a "*Split Off*" action item to inbound
    correspondence items in ticket history, which allows the operator to
    create a new ticket, linked to the current one, based on that
    transaction.

    When a ticket requestor replies to their open ticket with a new issue
    instead of creating a new ticket, this "*Split Off*" action allows the
    ticket owner to create a new ticket on the requestor's behalf, including
    the correspondence automatically.

    Using this action opens the ticket creation form, with the
    correspondence already included in the message box and the requestor set
    to the sender, and with a "referred to by" link back to the original
    ticket. The operator can then adjust the message as necessary before
    creating the new ticket.

    The action is only available to operators who have *CreateTicket* rights
    on the ticket's queue and *ModifyTicket* rights on the ticket.

    Known to work with RT 4.2.16, 4.4.4, and 5.0.1.
