=head1 NAME

eris::log - Structured log or event object implementation

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 raw

The unstructured log or event as passed to the contextualizer.

=head2 decoded

Hash of hashes built by the L<eris::log::decoders->decode()> step.

=head2 context

Compressed hash built by the L<eris::log::contexts->contextualize> step.
Contexts are called in order by priority.  As each context runs, it's possible
to clobber the context key of a previous context.  This represents the final
state of the compressed namespace for the structured event.

=head2 complete

Also populated by the L<eris::log::contexts->contextualize> step, but uses a
first level key of the context name to preserve where information orignated
and protect duplicate keys.

=head2 timing

ArrayRef storing hash references representing the time each step of the
contextualizer took while turning the unstructured event into a structured
one.

    [
        { phase => 'context::sshd', seconds => 0.0003  },
    ]

Add new timings using the L<add_timings> method like:

    $log->add_timing( thing => 0.212 );

=head2 tags

ArrayRef of tags to index with the doc.  Add new tags with the L<add_tags>
method.

=head2 total_time

Stores the time the entire process took as a single element.

=head2 epoch

B<Required>: The numeric representation of the time since the UNIX Epoch.  Can
be an integer or float.  This is required to index the log in the right time.

=head2 type

Provided to override the type in the schema if being sent to Elasticsearch.

You probably shouldn't use this just set a default_type in your schema.
Elastic's official docs recommend a single type per index.

=head2 uuid

Optional GUID reperesentation.  If set will be passed along to Elasticsearch as
the document B<_id>, otherwise Elasticsearch will autogenerate it.

Unless you know what you're doing, you probably shouldn't set this in your
contexts or schemas.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_context

Takes two parameters: context name as a string, a hash reference containing the context to add

Use this to add add context data in your own L<eris::role::context> plugins:

    sub contextualize_message {
        my ($self,$log) = @_;

        $log->add_context( $self->name, { static_key => "static values are shocking" } )l
    }

=head2 add_tags

Takes a list of string tags to add to the object.  Deduplicates and adds new
tags to the object.

=head2 add_timing

Takes a hash of timing data to add to the timing store.  This is called by the
L<eris::log::contexts>, L<eris::log::decoders>, and
L<eris::log::contextualizer> automatically.  You probably never need to call
this method yourself.

=head2 as_doc

Arguments parsed from a hash:

=over 2

=item B<complete>

Boolean, default false.  If set to true, the document is sourced for the
C<eris::log> complete event with the context namespaces as first level keys is
returned.  By default the C<eris::log> context hash is returned which is a
merged set of keys from all contexts.

=item B<flatten>

Do we flatten the key space using L<Hash::Flatten>.  This defaults to false see
the differences:

    # Default (false)
    {
        a => {
           b => 0,
           c => 1,
        }
    }

    # Flatten (true)
    {
       a.b => 0,
       a.c => 1,
    }
