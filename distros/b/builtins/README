builtins version 0.000003

Under Perl 5.36 or later, this module loads every available built-in function
from the builtin:: namespace, and turns off the warnings about them still
being experimental.

In other words, loading this module via:

    use builtins;

...is the same as writing:

    use experimental 'builtin';
    use builtin qw(
        ceil    floor     trim
        true    false     is_bool
        weaken  unweaken  is_weak
        blessed refaddr   reftype
        created_as_string created_as_number
    );
