NAME
    builtin::compat - Provide builtin functions for older perl versions

SYNOPSIS
      use builtin::compat qw(
        true
        false
        is_bool
        weaken
        unweaken
        is_weak
        blessed
        refaddr
        reftype
        created_as_string
        created_as_number
        ceil
        floor
        trim
        indexed
      );

DESCRIPTION
    Provides builtin functions for perl versions that do not include the
    builtin module.

    No functions are exported by default.

    This module does its best to behave similar to builtin, which creates
    its exported functions as lexicals. The functions will be created in the
    currently compiling scope, not the immediate caller of
    "builtin::compat->import". The functions will also be removed at the end
    of the compilation scope using namespace::clean.

    The builtin functions will be used directly when they are available.

FUNCTIONS
    true
        See "true" in builtin.

    false
        See "false" in builtin.

    is_bool
        See "is_bool" in builtin.

        Prior to perl 5.36, it was not possible to track boolean values
        fully accurately. This function will not be perfectly accurate on
        earlier perl versions.

    weaken
        See "weaken" in builtin.

    unweaken
        See "unweaken" in builtin.

    is_weak
        See "is_weak" in builtin.

    blessed
        See "blessed" in builtin.

    refaddr
        See "refaddr" in builtin.

    reftype
        See "reftype" in builtin.

    created_as_string
        See "created_as_string" in builtin.

        Prior to perl 5.36, it was not possible to check if a scalar value
        was created as a number or as a string fully accurately. This
        function will not be entirely accurate before then, but should be as
        accurate as is possible on these perl versions. In particular, a
        string like "12345" that has been used as a number will cause
        "create_as_string" to return false and "created_as_number" to return
        true.

    created_as_number
        See "created_as_number" in builtin.

        Has the same caveats as "created_as_string".

    ceil
        See "ceil" in builtin.

    floor
        See "floor" in builtin.

    trim
        See "trim" in builtin.

    indexed
        See "indexed" in builtin.
