NAME

    builtin::Backport - provide backported builtin functions for earlier
    Perl versions

DESCRIPTION

    Perl version 5.36 added many functions in a module called builtin;
    these may be further expanded in later perl versions. Many of the
    functions provided in this space, however, can be implemented just fine
    on earlier Perl versions.

    This distribution provides a modified builtin.pm file which includes
    most of the missing functions for earlier versions of Perl. Once
    installed, code can simply use builtin ... as would work on Perl 5.36
    onwards, and for the most part would work identically.

    Some functions cannot be supported on older versions; where necessary
    this is pointed out in the modified documentation in the module.

    Because builtin itself uses lexical exporting to provide its functions,
    they can only be provided on Perl version 5.18 onwards, when lexical
    subs were implemented.
