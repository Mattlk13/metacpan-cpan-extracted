NAME
    builtins::compat - install all the new builtins from the builtin namespace
    (Perl 5.36+), and try our best on older versions of Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use 5.008001;          # Or later
      use builtins::compat;  # Loads all new builtins
  
      # So now we can write...
      if ( reftype($x) eq 'ARRAY' || blessed($x) ) {
          print refaddr($x), "\n";
          if ( is_weak($x) ) {
              unweaken($x);
              print ceil( refaddr($x) / floor($y) ), "\n";
              weaken($x);
              print trim($description), "\n";
          }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module does the same as builtins on Perl 5.36 and above. On older
    versions of Perl, it tries to implement the same functions and then clean
    them from your namespace using namespace::clean.

    The pre-5.36 versions of `created_as_number`, `created_as_string`, and
    `is_bool` may not be 100% perfect implementations.

IMPORT
    To import the functions provided in Perl 5.36:

      use builtins::compat qw( :5.36 );

    If future versions of Perl add more functions to builtin, then these will
    be provided under different version number tags.

    Importing `use builtins::compat` with no arguments will import the Perl
    5.36 builtins, even if you're using a newer version of Perl.

    You can import only specific functions by listing their names:

      use builtins::compat qw( refaddr reftype );

    You can exclude specific functions by name too. For all the Perl 5.36
    functions except `indexed`:

      use builtins::compat qw( :5.36 !indexed );
