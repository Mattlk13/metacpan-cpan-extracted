NAME
    HTTP::Tiny::Cache - Cache HTTP::Tiny responses

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of HTTP::Tiny::Cache (from Perl
    distribution HTTP-Tiny-Cache), released on 2019-04-14.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Tiny::Cache;

     my $res  = HTTP::Tiny::Cache->new->get("http://www.example.com/");
     my $res2 = HTTP::Tiny::Cache->request(GET => "http://www.example.com/"); # cached response

DESCRIPTION
    This class is a subclass of HTTP::Tiny that cache responses.

    Currently only GET requests are cached. Cache are keyed by
    SHA256-hex(URL). Error responses are also cached. Currently no
    cache-related HTTP request or response headers (e.g. "Cache-Control")
    are respected.

    To determine cache max age, this module will consult environment
    variables (see "ENVIRONMENT"). If all environment variables are not set,
    will use the default 86400 (1 day).

ENVIRONMENT
  CACHE_MAX_AGE
    Int. Will be consulted after "HTTP_TINY_CACHE_MAX_AGE".

  HTTP_TINY_CACHE_MAX_AGE
    Int. Will be consulted before "CACHE_MAX_AGE".
