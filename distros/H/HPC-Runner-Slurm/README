NAME

    HPC::Runner::Slurm - Job Submission to Slurm

SYNOPSIS

    Please see the indepth documentation at HPC::Runner::Usage.

        package Main;
        extends 'HPC::Runner::Slurm';
    
        Main->new_with_options(infile => '/path/to/commands');

    This module is a wrapper around sbatch and can be used to submit
    arbirtary bash commands to slurm.

    It has two levels of management. The first is the main sbatch command,
    and the second is the actual job, which runs commands in parallel,
    controlled by HPC::Runner::Threads or HPC::Runner::MCE.

    It supports job dependencies. Put in the command 'wait' to tell slurm
    that some job or jobs depend on some other jobs completion. Put in the
    command 'newnode' to tell HPC::Runner::Slurm to submit the job to a new
    node.

    The only necessary option is the --infile.

 Submit Script

        cmd1
        cmd2 && cmd3
        cmd4 \
        --option cmd4 \
        #Tell HPC::Runner::Slurm to put in some job dependencies.
        wait
        cmd5
        #Tell HPC::Runner::Slurm to pass things off to a new node, but this job doesn't depend on the previous
        newnode
        cmd6

 get_nodes

    Get the nodes from sinfo if not supplied

    If the nodelist is supplied partition must be supplied

 submit_slurm()

    Submit jobs to slurm queue using sbatch.

    This subroutine was just about 100% from the following perlmonks
    discussions. All that I did was add in some logging.

    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=151886 You can use the script at the
    top to test the runner. Just download it, make it executable, and put
    it in the infile as

    perl command.pl 1 perl command.pl 2 #so on and so forth
