Changelog for HealthCheck-Diagnostic-WebRequest

v1.4.3 2024-09-16T16:12:18
 - Update README / LICENSE (Brendan Byrd)
 - Pull request #9: SM-5089 (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Set default value for ref checks in string comparisons to
   prevent warnings (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Ensured the ua parameter is left untouched, and cleaned up more
   potentially real URLs in tests (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Ensured default params are applied first, so they don't override
   individual check args (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Indicated internal helpers are private with leading underscores
   for POD tests. Fixed nested L<> (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Ran make update for latest Makefile with disttest target (Samuel
   Ng)
 - SM-5089 Simplified check validation in register by only supporting
   hashrefs and HealthCheck::Diagnostic::WebRequest instances (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Moved requests_redirectable configuration closer to ua
   instantiation in constructor (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Moved validation of checks into register method in case it gets
   called directly with modified checks (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Replaced real URLs in documentation and tests with .example
   URLs. Improved redundancy and clarity in POD (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Improved readability of constructor validation and made
   no_follow_redirects a no-op when ua is provided. Also, turned all dies
   into croaks for easier debugging (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Modified HealthCheck::Diagnostic::WebRequests wrapper to
   subclass HealthCheck to take advantage of the checks field for grouping
   multiple HealthCheck::Diagnostic::WebRequest instances. Renamed classes
   accordingly (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Refactored the ua_action attribute to an overridable method on
   the class (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Added validation of ua_action, since it's not intended to be
   used with the url, request, or ua parameters (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Modified response_time_threshold check to verify definedness for
   the 0 threshold case (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Made healthcheck always include response time regardless of
   whether threshold argument was passed. Reordered the results so the
   status is always first (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Replaced actual sleeps in tests with Test::Mock::Time (Samuel
   Ng)
 - SM-5089 Renamed occurrences of diags to diagnostics (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Accounted for singular elapsed time in info (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Replaced fake.site.us with fake.site.test to not conflict with
   any real domains that may be owned by a third party (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Added a new class to allow grouping of multiple web request
   diagnostics (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Allowed ua and ua_action as optional constructor args for
   overriding the default user agent and the coderef that returns the HTTP
   response (Samuel Ng)
 - SM-5089 Added support for response time check (Samuel Ng)
