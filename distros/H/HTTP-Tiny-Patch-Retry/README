VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of HTTP::Tiny::Patch::Retry (from
    Perl distribution HTTP-Tiny-Patch-Retry), released on 2018-10-06.

SYNOPSIS
    From Perl:

     use HTTP::Tiny::Patch::Retry
         # -retries => 4, # optional, default is 3
         # -delay   => 5, # optional, default is 2
     ;

     my $res  = HTTP::Tiny->new->get("http://www.example.com/");

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches HTTP::Tiny to retry fail responses (a.k.a. responses
    with 5xx statuses; 4xx are considered the client's fault so we don't
    retry those).

CONFIGURATION

    Int, default 3. Maximum number of consecutive retries for a request. 0
    will disable retrying.

  -delay
    Int, default 2. Number of seconds to wait between retries.
