NAME
    HTTP::Tiny::CustomRetry - Retry failed HTTP::Tiny requests

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of HTTP::Tiny::CustomRetry (from
    Perl distribution HTTP-Tiny-CustomRetry), released on 2019-04-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Tiny::CustomRetry;

     my $res  = HTTP::Tiny::CustomRetry->new(
         retry_strategy => 'Exponential', # required, pick a strategy (which is name of submodule under Algorithm::Backoff::*)

         # the following attributes are available to customize the Exponential
         # strategy, which are attributes from Algorithm::Backoff::Exponential with
         # retry_ prefix.

         # retry_max_attempts     => ...,
         # retry_jitter_factor    => ...,
         # retry_initial_delay    => ...,
         # retry_max_delay        => ...,
         # retry_exponent_base    => ...,
         # retry_delay_on_success => ...,

     )->get("http://www.example.com/");

DESCRIPTION
    This class is a subclass of HTTP::Tiny that retry fail responses (a.k.a.
    responses with 5xx statuses; 4xx are considered the client's fault so we
    don't retry those).

    It's a more elaborate version of HTTP::Tiny::Retry which offers a simple
    retry strategy: using a constant delay between attempts.
    HTTP::Tiny::CustomRetry uses Algorithm::Retry to offer several
    retry/backoff strategies.

ENVIRONMENT
  HTTP_TINY_CUSTOMRETRY_STRATEGY
    String. Used to set default for the "retry_strategy" attribute.

    Other "retry_ATTRNAME" attributes can also be set via environment
    HTTP_TINY_CUSTOMRETRY_*ATTRNAME*, for example "retry_max_attempts" can
    be set via HTTP_TINY_CUSTOMRETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS.
