	* Update required version to Perl 5.8 for the :raw
	encoding.

1.130 - 2011-04-18
	* Update the cookie expiry times so the tests pass
	* Everything else works the same as before

1.120 - 2008-08-06
	* Fix to Cookies.dat file to ensure the cookies don't expire
	so the tests don't fail
	* Note in docs that this does not yet support iCab 4

1.09 - 2007-01-10
	* Fixed endian bug in date reading. Now that Macs have Intel, that
	matters.
	* Updated license stuff.
	* Everyone should upgrade.

1.07 - 2006-07-20
	* Fixed up one of the tests which failed due to an expiring cookie
	in the test test. Three years ago seems like a long time now. :)
	* No need to upgrade if you already have this installed.

1.05 - 2005-03-12
	* Added POD coverage tests

0.91 - 2004-09-17
	 * distribution cleanups: no need to upgrade
	 * this is a non-developer release, although it might still have
	 problems

0.90_01 - 2003-01-09
	* DEVELOPER'S RELEASE - the save() function does not work, but
	the load() function does (should, might, etc.).  I still do not
	understand the entire format, but I can pull out the stuff that
	HTTP::Cookies needs.
