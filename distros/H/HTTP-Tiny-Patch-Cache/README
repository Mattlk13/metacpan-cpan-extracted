NAME
    HTTP::Tiny::Patch::Cache - Cache HTTP::Tiny responses

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of HTTP::Tiny::Patch::Cache (from
    Perl distribution HTTP-Tiny-Patch-Cache), released on 2019-04-14.

SYNOPSIS
    From Perl:

     use HTTP::Tiny::Patch::Cache
         # -max_age => 7200, # optional, sets max age, can also be set via environment variables
     ;

     my $res  = HTTP::Tiny->new->get("http://www.example.com/");
     my $res2 = HTTP::Tiny->request(GET => "http://www.example.com/"); # cached response

    From command-line (one-liner):

     % perl -MHTTP::Tiny::Patch::Cache -E'my $res = HTTP::Tiny->new->get("..."); ...'

    To customize cache period (default is one day, the example below sets it
    to 2 hours):

     % CACHE_MAX_AGE=7200 perl -MHTTP::Tiny::Patch::Cache ...

    To clear cache, you can temporarily set cache period to 0:

     % CACHE_MAX_AGE=0 perl -MHTTP::Tiny::Patch::Cache ...

    Or you can delete *$tempdir/http_tiny_patch_cache/*, where *$tempdir* is
    retrieved from File::Util::Tempdir's "get_user_tempdir()".

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches HTTP::Tiny to cache responses.

    Currently only GET requests are cached. Cache are keyed by
    SHA256-hex(URL). Error responses are also cached. Currently no
    cache-related HTTP request or response headers (e.g. "Cache-Control")
    are respected. This patch is mostly useful when testing (e.g. saving
    bandwidth when repeatedly getting huge HTTP pages).

CONFIGURATION
  -max_age
    Int. Sets maximum age for cache. If not set, will consult environment
    variables (see "ENVIRONMENT"). If all environment variables are not set,
    will use the default 86400.

FAQ
ENVIRONMENT
  CACHE_MAX_AGE
    Int. Will be consulted after "HTTP_TINY_PATCH_CACHE_MAX_AGE".

  HTTP_TINY_PATCH_CACHE_MAX_AGE
    Int. Will be consulted before "CACHE_MAX_AGE".
