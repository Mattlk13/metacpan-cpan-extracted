NAME
    Hash::Iter - Generate a coderef iterator for a hash

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Hash::Iter (from Perl
    distribution Hash-Iter), released on 2024-11-04.

SYNOPSIS
      use Hash::Iter qw(hash_iter pair_iter);

      my $iter = hash_iter({1,2,3,4,5,6});
      while (my ($key,$val) = $iter->()) { ... }

      $iter = pair_iter(1,2,3,4,5,6);
      while (my ($key,$val) = $iter->()) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple iterator which is a coderef that you can
    call repeatedly to get pairs of a hash/hashref. When the pairs are
    exhausted, the coderef will return undef. No class/object involved.

    The principle is very simple and you can do it yourself with:

     my $iter = do {
         my $hash = shift;
         my $i = 0;

         my @ary = keys %$hash;
         sub {
             if ($i < @ary) {
                 my $key = $ary[$i++];
                 return ($key, $hash->{$key});
             } else {
                 return undef;
             }
         };
      }

    Caveat: if list/array contains an "undef" element, it cannot be
    distinguished with an exhausted iterator.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
