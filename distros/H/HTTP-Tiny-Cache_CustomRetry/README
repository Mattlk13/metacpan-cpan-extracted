NAME
    HTTP::Tiny::Cache_CustomRetry - Cache response + retry failed request

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of HTTP::Tiny::Cache_CustomRetry
    (from Perl distribution HTTP-Tiny-Cache_CustomRetry), released on
    2019-04-12.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Tiny::Cache_CustomRetry;

DESCRIPTION
    EXPERIMENTAL / PROOF-OF-CONCEPT ONLY.

    This class combines the functionalities of HTTP::Tiny::Cache (HT:Cache)
    and HTTP::Tiny::CustomRetry (HT:CustomRetry). Since both HT:Cache and
    HT:CustomRetry both extend HTTP::Tiny (HT), this module modifies
    HT:CustomRetry's @ISA to point to HT:Retry instead. This is a hack and
    probably only serves to show the limitation of subclassing mechanism for
    adding functionalities, like we see in the WWW::Mechanize land. For an
    alternative solution, see HTTP::Tiny::Plugin which is a plugin-enabled
    variant of HTTP::Tiny.
