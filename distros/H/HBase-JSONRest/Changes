Revision history for HBase-JSONRest

0.043  Date/Time: 2015-12-03

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added support for gzip content-encoding, to save on bandwidth


0.042  Date/time: 2015-09-02

        [BUG FIXES]
        - Fixed a bug in multiget - if some of specified keys are missing
          they will be ignored properly (themage).


0.041  Date/time: 2015-08-31

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Don't create HTTP::Tiny object in each request. Create it in
          constructor and keep it in hbase object instance so it can be
          reused. This means that the same instance of HTTP::Tiny can
          used for many requests, so connections can be reused.
        - More debug info for failed requests
        - Added strict mode. Defaults to false. If activated, the hbase
          handle will die on unsuccessful request.

        [BUG FIXES]
        - Allow scans with pefix '0'
        - Fixed bug in_build_get_uri - lost columns when current url
          became too long (dtcyganov)
        - Fixed bug in _build_multiget_uri - lost keys when current url
          became too long (dtcyganov)

        - Added support for specifying and retrieving an arbitrary number

        - Added support for [startrow, endrow) scanner

        [BUG FIXES]
        - Fixed a bug for PREFIX scanner - when prefix is depleted, the
          scanning will stop as it should.


0.032   Date/time: 2015-06-19

        [BUG FIXES]

          inserted.
