NAME
    HashData - Specification for HashData::*, modules that contains hash
    data

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.1

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.1.1 of HashData (from Perl
    distribution HashData), released on 2021-06-01.

SYNOPSIS
    Use one of the "Hash::*" modules.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY SPECIFICATION; THINGS WILL STILL CHANGE A LOT.

    "HashData::*" modules are modules that contain hash data. The hash can
    be stored in an actual Perl hash in the source code, or as lines in the
    DATA section of the source code, or in other places. The hash data can
    be accessed via a standard interface (see HashDataRole::Spec::Basic).
    Some examples of hash data are:

    *   A mapping between PAUSE IDs and CPAN author names
        (HashData::CPAN::AuthorName::ByPAUSEID)

    *   A mapping of ISO 2-letter country codes with their English names
        (HashData::Country::EN::EnglishName::ByISO2)

    *   A mapping of answer word and their clues from New York Times 2000
        cross-word puzzles, handy for generating cross-word puzzle games
        (HashData::Word::EN::NYT::2000::Clue::ByWord)

    *   FOLDOC dictionary, entries with their definition
        (HashData::Dict::EN::FOLDOC)

        Also eligible for cross-word or word-guessing games.

    *   Another dictionary (HashData::Dict::ID::KBBI)

        Also eligible for cross-word or word-guessing games.

    Why put data in a Perl module, as a Perl distribution? To leverage the
    Perl/CPAN toolchain and infrastructure: 1) ease of installation, update,
    and uninstallation; 2) allowing dependency expression and version
    comparison; 3) ease of packaging further as OS packages, e.g. Debian
    packages (converted from Perl distribution); 4) testing by CPAN Testers.

    To get started, see HashDataRole::Spec::Basic and one of existing
    "HashData::*" modules.

NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION
    "HashData" (this module) is the specification.

    "HashDataRole::*" the roles.

    "HashDataRoles-*" is name for distribution that contains several roles.

    "HashDataBase::*" the base classes. "HashDataBases::*" are main module
    names for distributions that bundle multiple base classes.

    All the modules under "HashData::*" will be modules with actual data.
    They should be named using this rule:

     HashData::<CATEGORY>::<VALUE_ENTITY>::By<KEY_ENTITY>

    *CATEGORY* can be multiple levels. *VALUE_ENTITY* and *KEY_ENTITY*
    should be in singular form. Examples:

     HashData::CPAN::AuthorName::ByPAUSEID
     HashData::Country::EN::EnglishName::ByISO2
     HashData::Country::EN::EnglishName::ByISO3
     HashData::Country::EN::IndonesianName::ByISO2
     HashData::Country::EN::IndonesianName::ByISO3
     HashData::Country::EN::ISO2::ByIndonesianName (reverse mapping of country Indonesian names to ISO 2-letter codes)

    An exception is HashData::Dict::* where it is assumed that keys will be
    entries (usually words) and values will be the entries' definitions.
    Examples:

     HashData::Dict::EN::OxfordLearner (no need for: HashData::Dict::EN::OxfordLearner::Definition::ByWord)
     HashData::Dict::ID::KBBI
     HashData::Dict::EN::FOLDOC

    "HashDataBundle-*" is name for distribution that contains several
    "HashData" modules.
