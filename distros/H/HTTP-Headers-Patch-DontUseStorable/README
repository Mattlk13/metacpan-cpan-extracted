NAME
    HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable - (DEPRECATED) Do not use Storable

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.062 of
    HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable (from Perl distribution
    HTTP-Headers-Patch-DontUseStorable), released on 2021-08-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable;

DESCRIPTION
    UPDATE 2020-02-03: As of Storable 3.08, freeze/thaw/dclone support
    Regexp objects. I'm deprecating this module.

    HTTP::Headers (6.11 as of this writing) tries to load Storable (2.56 as
    of this writing) and use its dclone() method. Since Storable still does
    not support serializing Regexp objects, HTTP::Headers/HTTP::Message
    croaks when fed data with Regexp objects.

    This patch avoids using Storable and clone using the alternative method.

FAQ
  Is this a bug with HTTP::Headers? Why don't you submit a bug to HTTP-Message?
    I tend not to think this is a bug with HTTP::Headers; after all,
    Storable's dclone() is a pretty standard way to clone data in Perl. This
    patch is more of a workaround for current Storable's deficiencies.

  Shouldn't you add STORABLE_{freeze,thaw} methods to Regexp instead?
    This no longer works with newer Perls (5.12 and later).

  Why would an HTTP::Headers object contain a Regexp object in the first place? Shouldn't it only contain strings (and arrays/hashes of strings)?
    True. This might be a bug with the client code (e.g. in my module which
    uses this patch, Finance::Bank::ID::Mandiri). I haven't investigated
    further though and this is the stop-gap solution.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
