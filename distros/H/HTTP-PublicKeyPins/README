NAME

    HTTP::PublicKeyPins - Generate RFC 7469 HTTP Public Key Pin (HPKP)
    header values

VERSION

    Version 0.15

SYNOPSIS

    Make it more difficult for the bad guys to Man-In-The-Middle your users
    TLS sessions

        use HTTP::Headers();
        use HTTP::PublicKeyPins qw( pin_sha256 );
    
        ...
        my $h = HTTP::Headers->new();
        $h->header( 'Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only',
                'pin-sha256="'
              . pin_sha256('/etc/pki/tls/certs/example.pem')
              . '"; pin-sha256="'
              . pin_sha256('/etc/pki/tls/certs/backup.req')
              . '"; report-uri="https://example.com/pkp-report.pl' );

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows the calculation of RFC 7469 HTTP Public Key Pin
    header values. This can be used to verify your TLS session to a remote
    server has not been hit by a Man-In-The-Middle attack OR to instruct
    your users to ignore any TLS sessions to your web service that does not
    use your Public Key

EXPORT

 pin_sha256

    This function accepts the path to a X.509 Certificate
    <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280>. It will load the public key from
    the certificate and prepare the appropriate value for the pin_sha256
    parameter of the Public-Key-Pins value. This function will also make an
    attempt to read public keys (in PEM (SubjectPublicKeyInfo
    <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.7> or PKCS#1
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2437>) or DER format), private keys (in
    PEM PKCS#1 or DER format) and PKCS#10 Certificate Requests
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986> in PEM or DER format.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

    None. This module only has the one exported function.

DIAGNOSTICS

    Failed to open %s for reading

      Failed to open the supplied X.509 Certificate, PKCS10 Certificate
      Request, Private or Public Key file

    Failed to read from %s

      Failed to read from the X.509 Certificate, PKCS10 Certificate
      Request, Private or Public Key file

    %s is not an X.509 Certificate, PKCS10 Certificate Request, Private or
    Public Key

      The supplied input file does not look like X.509 Certificate File,
      PKCS10 Certificate Request, Private or Public Key. These files may be
      encoded in PEM or DER format. A PEM encoded X.509 Certificate file
      has the following header

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

      A PEM encoded PKCS#10 Certificate Request has the following header

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

      A PEM encoded PKCS#1 Public Key has the following header

        -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

      A PEM encoded PKCS#1 Private Key has the following header

        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

      A PEM encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo Public Key has the following
      header

        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

    HTTP::PublicKeyPins requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.
