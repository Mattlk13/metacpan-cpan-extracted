HPCD::SGE is a driver for HPCI (High Performance Computing Interface).
An HPCD (High Performance Computing Driver) module translates the
standard HPCI interface into the appropriate access mechanisms for a
specific type of cluster that is selected.

In this module, the target cluster type is SGE (Sun Grid Engine).

This module (and HPCI) was derived from SGE cluster-specific modules
that were used internally at Boutros Lab.

It has replaced the use of those SGE-specific modules extensively within
Boutros Lab, so it has received a significant amount of actual use.

See the notes for HPCI for most details about usage - the docs within
this module only describe the SGE-specific differences.

There is a discussion list available for HPCI.  Subscribe through:
