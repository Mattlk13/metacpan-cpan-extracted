HPCD::SLURM is a driver for HPCI (High Performance Computing Interface).
An HPCD (High Performance Computing Driver) module translates the
standard HPCI interface into the appropriate access mechanisms for a
specific type of cluster that is selected.

In this module, the target cluster type is SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management).

This module was derived from HPCD::SGE. This is the initial release, and has
been tested only on a small test slurm cluster comprising 1 head node and 4
child nodes. Therefore some problems might arise when it gets tested on a real
slurm server. That should happen soon.

See the notes for HPCI for most details about usage - the docs within
this module only describe the SLURM-specific differences.
