NAME
    HTTP::Tiny::Plugin::CustomRetry - (DEPRECATED) Retry failed request

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of HTTP::Tiny::Plugin::CustomRetry
    (from Perl distribution HTTP-Tiny-Plugin-CustomRetry), released on
    2020-08-15.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Tiny::Plugin 'CustomRetry' => {
         strategy         => 'Exponential',
         strategy_options => {initial_delay=>2, max_delay=>100},
         retry_if         => qr/^[45]/, # optional, default is only 5xx errors are retried
     };

     my $res  = HTTP::Tiny::Plugin->new->get("http://www.example.com/");

DESCRIPTION
    DEPRECATION NOTICE: This plugin is now deprecated, in favor of
    HTTP::Tiny::Plugin::Retry which now supports Algorithm::Backoff too.

    This plugin retries failed response using one of available backoff
    strategy in "Algorithm::Backoff::*" (e.g.
    Algorithm::Backoff::Exponential).

    By default only retries 5xx failures, as 4xx are considered to be
    client's fault (but you can configure it with "retry_if").

CONFIGURATION
  strategy
    Str. Name of backoff strategy, which corresponds to
    Algorithm::Backoff::<strategy>.

  strategy_options
    Hashref. Will be passed to Algorithm::Backoff::* constructor.

  retry_if
    Regex or code. If regex, then will be matched against response status.
    If code, will be called with arguments: "($self, $response)".
