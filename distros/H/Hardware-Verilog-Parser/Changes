0.03  7 Feb 2000

	cannot parse an always block though.

0.04  7 Feb 2000
	parses always blocks
	parses module instantiations
	added Hierarchy.pm module
	added hierarchy.pl script

0.05  8 Feb 2000
	made some fixes to expression rules

0.06  9 Feb 2000
	fixed some grammar rules
	can now handle `include, `define, `undef directives

0.07  18 Feb 2000
	got rid of all leftop constructs in rules.
	Added Hardware::Verilog::StdLogic.pm module to 
		evaluate constant expressions.

0.08  23 Feb 2000
	Simple constant expressions are now evaluated correctly.
	 8'h4 + 8'h3 + 8'h2   is evaluated to    8'h9
	changed rules to Parser.pm to support constant expressions,
	and changed StdLogic.pm to support this as well.

	Precompiled parser now works.  Parses test1.v in about 6 seconds.
	generate_precompiled_parser.pl can't seem to properly
	insert the "use Hardware::Verilog::StdLogic" line
	correctly though. Have to manually edit the PrecompiledParser.pm
	file to do it correctly.
