
HiPi is a Perl distribution that you install into the
existing Perl on your Raspberry Pi.

This release of HiPi is tested against the
current Raspbian release.

For a simple automated installation:

  wget http:/raspberry.znix.com/hipifiles/hipi-install
  sudo perl hipi-install

For a do-it yourself you could do

cpan -i HiPi

or

wget http:/raspberry.znix.com/hipifiles/hipi-latest.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hipi-latest.tar.gz
cd hipi-src
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
sudo perl Build install

You can look at the script userbin/hipi-install in the
source to see how it installs library dependencies. It
might save you much pain.
