NAME

    HTML::KhatGallery::Plugin::SortNaturally - Plugin for khatgallery to
    use Natural sort for index lists.

SYNOPSIS

        # use the khatgallery script
        khatgallery --plugins HTML::KhatGallery::Plugin::SortNaturally I<directory>
        
        # from within a script
        require HTML::KhatGallery;
    
        my @plugins = qw(HTML::KhatGallery:;Core HTML::KhatGallery::Plugin::SortNaturally);
        HTML::KhatGallery->import(@plugins);
        HTML::KhatGallery->run(%args);

DESCRIPTION

    This is a plugin for khatgallery to use Natural sort for index lists.

OBJECT METHODS

    Documentation for developers and those wishing to write plugins.

Dir Action Methods

    Methods implementing directory-related actions. All such actions expect
    a reference to a state hash, and generally will update either that hash
    or the object itself, or both, in the course of their running.

 sort_images

    Sorts the $dir_state->{files} array.

 sort_dirs

    Sorts the $dir_state->{subdirs} array.

REQUIRES

        Test::More
        HTML::KhatGallery
        Sort::Naturally

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Build install

    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the
    "./" notation, you can do this:

       perl Build.PL
       perl Build
       perl Build test
       perl Build install

    In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a
    directory under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

       perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

    as the first step instead.

    This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

    You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to
    find the modules.

    Therefore you will need to change the PERL5LIB variable to add
    /home/fred/perl/lib

            PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}

SEE ALSO

    perl(1).
