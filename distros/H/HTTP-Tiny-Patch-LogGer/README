NAME
    HTTP::Tiny::Patch::LogGer - Log HTTP::Tiny with Log::ger

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of HTTP::Tiny::Patch::LogGer (from
    Perl distribution HTTP-Tiny-Patch-LogGer), released on 2019-06-09.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Tiny::Patch::LogGer (
         -log_request          => 1, # default 1
         -log_request_content  => 1, # default 1
         -log_response         => 1, # default 1
         -log_response_content => 1, # default 0
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches HTTP::Tiny to log various stuffs with Log::ger.
    Currently this is what gets logged:

    *   HTTP request

        The raw request sent on-the-wire as well as non-raw request. The raw
        request is not sent if connection cannot be established; that's why
        we log both the raw as well as non-raw request.

    *   HTTP response

        Currently *NOT* the raw/on-the-wire response.

CONFIGURATION
  -log_request => BOOL
  -log_request_content => BOOL
  -log_response => BOOL
    Content will not be logged though, enable "-log_response_content" for
    that.

  -log_response_content => BOOL
