NAME

    HPC::Runner - HPC Runner::Slurm, Runner::MCE and Runner::Threads base
    class

VERSION

    Version 2.4.2

SYNOPSIS

    This is a base class for HPC::Runner::MCE and HPC::Runner:Threads. You
    should not need to call this module directly.

EXPORT

VARIABLES

 infile

    File of commands separated by newline. The command 'wait' indicates all
    previous commands should finish before starting the next one.

 _set_infile

    Internal variable

 outdir

    Directory to write out files and logs.

 _set_outdir

    Internal variable

 logdir

    Pattern to use to write out logs directory. Defaults to
    outdir/prunner_current_date_time/log1 .. log2 .. log3.

 procs

    Total number of running children allowed at any time. Defaults to 10.
    The command 'wait' can be used to have a variable number of children
    running. It is best to wrap this script in a slurm job to not overuse
    resources. This isn't used within this module, but passed off to
    mcerunner/parallelrunner.

Internal VARIABLES

    You shouldn't be calling these directly.

 wait

    Boolean value indicates any job dependencies

 process_table

    We also want to write all cmds and exit codes to a table

 plugins

    Load plugins

 jobref

    Array of arrays details slurm/process/scheduler job id. Index -1 is the
    most recent job submissisions, and there will be an index -2 if there
    are any job dependencies

Subroutines

 set_logdir

    Set the log directory

 set_logfile

    Set logfile

 init_log

    Initialize Log4perl log

 process_plugins

    Split and process plugins

 run_command_threads

    Start the thread, run the command, and finish the thread

 _log_commands

    Log the commands run them. Cat stdout/err with IO::Select so we
    hopefully don't break things.

    This example was just about 100% from the following perlmonks
    discussions.

    You can use the script at the top to test the runner. Just download it,
    make it executable, and put it in the infile as

    perl command.pl 1 perl command.pl 2 #so on and so forth
