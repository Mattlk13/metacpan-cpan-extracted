    Health::BladderDiary::GenTable - Create bladder diary table from entries

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Health::BladderDiary::GenTable
    (from Perl distribution Health-BladderDiary-GenTable), released on
    2020-11-11.

SYNOPSIS
    Your bladder entries e.g. in `bd-entry1.txt` (I usually write in Org
    document):

     0730 drink: 300ml type=water

     0718 urinate: 250ml

     0758 urinate: 100ml

     0915 drink 300ml

     1230 drink: 600ml, note=thirsty

     1245 urinate: 200ml

    From the command-line (I usually run the script from inside Emacs):

     % gen-bladder-diary-table-from-entries < bd-entry1.txt
     | time     | intake type | itime | ivol (ml) | ivol cum | icomment | urination time | uvol (ml) | uvol cum | urgency (0-3) | ucolor (0-3) | ucomment |
