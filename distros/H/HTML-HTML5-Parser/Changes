   doesn't work on that platform.

 - Remove 'use 5.010' from t/07ua.t.

0.204	2012-06-29

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Stop using defined-or operator in HTML::HTML5::Parser::UA, as it doesn't
   work in Perl 5.8.

0.202	2012-06-27

   of core since 5.14.

0.110	2012-03-20

   compatibility.
   Fixes RT#75809.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75809>

 [ Other ]
 - Comment nodes should now keep their line numbers and column numbers.
 - Text nodes should keep line numbers and column numbers too.
 - use XML::LibXML::Devel::SetLineNumber if it is available.

0.109	2012-03-15	Yes, they are come, but they are not past.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix several fatal errors on infrequently used code paths in
   TagSoupParser.pm.
 - Use correct case for MathML's definitionURL attribute.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Bundle test cases from html5lib.

 [ Other ]

   called in a list context).
 - Added: Provide dtd_element method to get more information about the DTD.
 - Added: Provide parse_balanced_chunk to parse HTML fragments.
 - Make source_line method work more reliably. This requires
   XML::LibXML::Devel, and thus a fairly recent version of XML-LibXML.

0.103	2011-02-09

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - TagSoupParser.pm called a method that is renamed between this
   distribution and upstream using its upstream name.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Copyright 2011.

0.102	2011-01-19

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix source_line method.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Allow <object> element to appear in <head> if document has an
   HTML4 doctype. This is a willful violation of the HTML5 parsing
   algorithm. (The <object> may have <param> elements as children, as well
   as any children that would normally be allowed in the <head> of the
   document, such as <meta>; any other content is treated as the beginning
   of the <body>, and thus closes <object> and <head>. That's slightly
   looser than the HTML 4 spec which says only <param> should be used, but
   stricter than the HTML 4 DTD which allows pretty much anything in
   there!)
 - Added: Support <figcaption> element.
 - Added: Support <summary> element.
 - Updated: Catch up to revision f2c921a886ab0b3dfb8d21b82525e98a4a921ad4
