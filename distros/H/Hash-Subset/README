NAME
    Hash::Subset - Produce subset of a hash

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Hash::Subset (from Perl
    distribution Hash-Subset), released on 2019-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Hash::Subset qw(hash_subset hashref_subset);

     # using keys specified in an array
     my %subset = hash_subset   ({a=>1, b=>2, c=>3}, ['b','c','d']); # => (b=>2, c=>3)
     my $subset = hashref_subset({a=>1, b=>2, c=>3}, ['b','c','d']); # => {b=>2, c=>3}

     # using keys specified in another hash
     my %subset = hash_subset   ({a=>1, b=>2, c=>3}, {b=>20, c=>30, d=>40}); # => (b=>2, c=>3)
     my $subset = hashref_subset({a=>1, b=>2, c=>3}, {b=>20, c=>30, d=>40}); # => {b=>2, c=>3}

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None exported by default.

  hash_subset
    Usage:

     my %subset  = hash_subset   (\%hash, \@keys);
     my $subset  = hashref_subset(\%hash, \@keys);
     my %subset  = hash_subset   (\%hash, \%another_hash);
     my $subset  = hashref_subset(\%hash, \%another_hash);

    Produce subset of %hash, returning the subset hash (or hashref, in the
    case of "hashref_subset" function).

    Perl lets you produce a hash subset using the hash slice notation:

     my %subset = %hash{"b","c","d"};

    The difference with "hash_subset" is: 1) hash slice is only available
    since perl 5.20 (in previous versions, only array slice is available);
    2) when the key does not exist in the array, perl will create it for you
    with "undef" as the value:

     my %hash   = (a=>1, b=>2, c=>3);
     my %subset = %hash{"b","c","d"}; # => (b=>2, c=>3, d=>undef)

    So basically "hash_subset" is equivalent to:

     my %subset = %hash{grep {exists $hash{$_}} "b","c","d"}; # => (b=>2, c=>3)

    and available for perl earlier than 5.20.
