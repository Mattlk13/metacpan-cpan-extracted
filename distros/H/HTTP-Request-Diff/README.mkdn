# NAME

HTTP::Request::Diff - create diffs between HTTP request

# SYNOPSIS

    my $diff = HTTP::Request::Diff->new(
        reference => $req,
        #actual    => $req2,
        skip_headers => \@skip,
        ignore_headers => \@skip2,
        mode => 'exact', # default is 'semantic'
    );

    my @differences = $diff->diff( $actual );
    say Dumper $differences[0];
    # {
    #   'kind' => 'value',
    #   'type' => 'query.foo',
    #   'reference' => [
    #                    undef
    #                  ],
    #   'actual' => [
    #                 'bar'
    #               ]
    # }
    #

# METHODS

## `->new`

    my $diff = HTTP::Request::Diff->new(
        mode => 'semantic',
    );

### Options

- `mode`

        mode => 'strict',

    The comparison mode. The default is semantic comparison, which considers some
    differences insignificant:

    - The order of HTTP headers
    - The boundary strings of multipart POST requests
    - The order of query parameters
    - The order of form parameters

    `strict` mode wants the requests to be as identical as possible.
    `lax` mode considers query parameters in the POST body as equivalent.

- `reference`

    (optional) The reference request to compare against. Alternatively pass in
    the request in the call to `->diff`.

- `skip_headers`

        skip_headers => ['X-Proxied-For'],

    List of headers to skip when comparing. Missing headers are not significant.

- `ignore_headers`

        ignore_headers => ['Accept-Encoding'],

    List of headers to ignore when comparing. Missing headers are significant.

- `canonicalize`

    Callback to canonicalize a request. The request will be passed in unmodified
    either as a string or a [HTTP::Request](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ARequest).

- `compare`

    Arrayref of things to compare.

## `->diff`

    my @diff = $diff->diff( $reference, $actual );
    my @diff = $diff->diff( $actual );

Performs the diff and returns an array of hashrefs with differences.

## `->as_table( @diff )`

    my @diff = $diff->diff( $request1, $request2 );
    print $diff->as_table( @diff );
    # +-----------------+-----------+--------+
    # | Type            | Reference | Actual |
    # | request.content | Ãœmloud    | Umloud |
    # +-----------------+-----------+--------+

Renders a diff as a table, using [Text::Table::Any](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text%3A%3ATable%3A%3AAny).
