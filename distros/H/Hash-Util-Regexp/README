DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    All the functions are exportable but not exported by default.

  has_key_matching
    Usage:

     my $bool = has_key_matching(\%hash, qr/some_regex/);

    This is a shortcut/alias for something like:

     my $bool = any { /some_regex/ } keys %hash;

  first_key_matching
    Usage:

     my $key = first_key_matching(\%hash, qr/some_regex/ [ , $sort ]);

    This is a shortcut/alias for something like:

     my $key = first { /some_regex/ } keys %hash;

    The optional $sort argument can be set to true (e.g. 1) or a coderef to
    sort the keys first.

  keys_matching
    Usage:

     my @keys = keys_matching(\%hash, qr/some_regex/ [ , $sort ]);

    This is a shortcut/alias for something like:

    The optional $sort argument can be set to true (e.g. 1) or a coderef to
    sort the keys first.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
