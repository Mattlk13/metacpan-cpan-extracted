NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::API::Dead::Currency - Marking dead currency APIs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::API::Dead::Currency (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-API-Dead-Currency), released on 2018-10-07.

DESCRIPTION
    Marking dead currency APIs.

    CPAN is full of unmaintained modules, including dead API's. Sadly,
    there's currently no easy way to mark such modules (CPANRatings is also
    dead, MetaCPAN only lets us ++ a module), hence this list.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX

    *   Finance::Currency::Convert

    *   Finance::Currency::Convert::XE

    *   Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo
