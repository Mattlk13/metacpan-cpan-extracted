ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    Desktop::Open
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        This module tries to select the appropriate application to open a
        file: using "start" (on Windows) or "xdg-open" (on other OS, if
        available), the falls back to Browser::Open.

        See App::DesktopOpenUtils which includes a CLI for this module:
        open-desktop.

    Spreadsheet::Open
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        Similar to Desktop::Open, but limiting the apps to spreadsheet
        applications.

    App::Open
        Author: ERIKH <https://metacpan.org/author/ERIKH>

        This module and tool requires configuration beforehand.

        Script: openit

    Open::This
        Author: OALDERS <https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS>

        This module (and the included ot tool) is geared upon opening a Perl
        source code file with a browser. You can specify a module name (e.g.
        "Foo::Bar"), a qualified function name (Foo::Bar::func_name()), or a
        sentence copy-pasted from "git-grep" or stack trace output.

        Script: ot

    Browser::Open
        Author: CFRANKS <https://metacpan.org/author/CFRANKS>

        A web browser can open many types of files, so this application is
        sometimes appropriate. The module will pick an available browser.
        You don\'t have to specify the path in URL form, e.g.
        "file:/path/to/file"; the module recognizes standard
        "/unix/path/syntax".

        See App::BrowserOpenUtils which provides a simple CLI for the
        module: open-browser.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
