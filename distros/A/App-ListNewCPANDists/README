NAME
    App::ListNewCPANDists - List new CPAN distributions in a given time
    period

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.017 of App::ListNewCPANDists (from
    Perl distribution App-ListNewCPANDists), released on 2022-09-02.

FUNCTIONS
  create_new_cpan_dists_stats
    Usage:

     create_new_cpan_dists_stats(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dists => *array*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_monthly_new_cpan_dists
    Usage:

     list_monthly_new_cpan_dists(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List new CPAN distributions in a given month.

    Like "list_new_cpan_dists" but you only need to specify month and year
    instead of starting and ending time period.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_author_re => *re*

    *   exclude_authors => *array[cpan::pause_id]*

    *   exclude_dist_re => *re*

    *   exclude_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   include_author_re => *re*

    *   include_authors => *array[cpan::pause_id]*

    *   include_dist_re => *re*

    *   include_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   month* => *int*

    *   year* => *int*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_monthly_new_cpan_dists_html
    Usage:

     list_monthly_new_cpan_dists_html(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List new CPAN distributions in a given month (HTML format).

    Like "list_monthly_new_cpan_dists" but produces HTML table instead of
    data structure.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_author_re => *re*

    *   exclude_authors => *array[cpan::pause_id]*

    *   exclude_dist_re => *re*

    *   exclude_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   include_author_re => *re*

    *   include_authors => *array[cpan::pause_id]*

    *   include_dist_re => *re*

    *   include_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   month* => *int*

    *   year* => *int*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_new_cpan_dists
    Usage:

     list_new_cpan_dists(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List new CPAN distributions in a given time period.

    Examples:

    *   Show new distributions from Jan 1, 2019 to the present:

         list_new_cpan_dists(from_time => "2019-01-01");

    This utility queries MetaCPAN to find out what CPAN distributions are
    new in a given time period (i.e. has their first release made during
    that time period). This utility also collects the information in a
    SQLite database which defaults to "~/cpan/index-lncd.db" or
    "~/index-lncd.db" if "~/cpan~" does not exist. You can customize the
    location of the generated SQLite database using the "cpan" and "db_name"
    arguments.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan". This actually does not need to be a real CPAN
        local mirror, but can be just an empty directory. If you use happen
        to use App::lcpan, you can use the local CPAN mirror generated by
        lcpan (which also defaults to "~/cpan") to store the database.

    *   db_name => *filename* (default: "index-lncd.db")

        Filename of database.

    *   exclude_author_re => *re*

    *   exclude_authors => *array[cpan::pause_id]*

    *   exclude_dist_re => *re*

    *   exclude_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   from_time => *date*

    *   include_author_re => *re*

    *   include_authors => *array[cpan::pause_id]*

    *   include_dist_re => *re*

    *   include_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   this_month => *true*

    *   this_week => *true*

        Monday is the start of the week.

    *   to_time => *date*

    *   today => *true*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
