NAME
    App::ListNewCPANDists - List new CPAN distributions in a given time
    period

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of App::ListNewCPANDists (from
    Perl distribution App-ListNewCPANDists), released on 2018-03-12.

FUNCTIONS
  list_monthly_new_cpan_dists
    Usage:

     list_monthly_new_cpan_dists(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    List new CPAN distributions in a given month.

    Like "list_new_cpan_dists" but you only need to specify month and year
    instead of starting and ending time period.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   month* => *int*

    *   year* => *int*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  list_monthly_new_cpan_dists_html
    Usage:

     list_monthly_new_cpan_dists_html(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    List new CPAN distributions in a given month (HTML format).

    Like "list_monthly_new_cpan_dists" but produces HTML table instead of
    data structure.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   month* => *int*

    *   year* => *int*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  list_new_cpan_dists
    Usage:

     list_new_cpan_dists(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    List new CPAN distributions in a given time period.

    This utility queries MetaCPAN to find out what CPAN distributions are
    new in a given time period (i.e. has their first release made during
    that time period). This utility also collects the information in a
    SQLite database which defaults to "~/cpan/index-lncd.db" or
    "~/index-lncd.db" if "~/cpan~" does not exist. You can customize the
    location of the generated SQLite database using the "cpan" and "db_name"
    arguments.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan". This actually does not need to be a real CPAN
        local mirror, but can be just an empty directory. If you use happen
        to use App::lcpan, you can use the local CPAN mirror generated by
        lcpan (which also defaults to "~/cpan") to store the database.

    *   db_name => *filename* (default: "index-lncd.db")

        Filename of database.

    *   from_time* => *date*

    *   to_time => *date*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
