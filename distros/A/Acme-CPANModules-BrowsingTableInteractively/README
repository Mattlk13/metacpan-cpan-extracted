NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively - Browsing table
    interactively

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-BrowsingTableInteractively), released on 2021-04-25.

DESCRIPTION
    The following are some options on CPAN if you have a table data
    (typically as an array of arrayrefs) and want to browse it
    interactively.

    Tickit::Table::Widget - this module lets you browse the table in a
    terminal. Using the Tickit library, the advantages it's supposed to have
    is mouse support. It's still very basic: you either have to specify each
    column width manually or the width of all columns will be the same.
    There's no horizontal scrolling support or a way to see long text in a
    column. Not updated since 2016.

    Term::TablePrint - this module lets you browse the table in a terminal.
    Provides roughly the same features like Tickit::Table::Widget with an
    extra one: you can press Enter on a row to view it as a "card" where
    each column will be displayed vertically, so you can better see a row
    that has many columns or columns with long text.

    Personally, both the above modules are not satisfactory for me. They are
    not that much better than drawing the text table and then filtering the
    output through a pager like *less*. At least with *less* you can scroll
    horizontally or perform incremental searching (though not interactive
    filtering of rows).

    Text::Table::HTML::DataTables - this module bundles the wonderful
    DataTables [1] JavaScript library and lets you see your table in a web
    browser to interact with. I use this method the most often (usually
    through my CLI framework and the option "--format=html+datatables"
    specified through my CLIs). The main advantage is incremental
    searching/filtering. DataTables also lets you hide/show/reorder columns,
    change the page size, and so on. This is leaps and bounds more useful
    than simply scrolling pages of text provided by Tickit::Table::Widget or
    Term::TablePrint.
