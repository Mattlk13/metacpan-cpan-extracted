NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively - Browsing table data
    interactively

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of
    Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-BrowsingTableInteractively), released on 2021-05-01.

DESCRIPTION
    This list catalogs are some options on CPAN if you have a table data
    (typically as an array of arrayrefs) and want to browse it
    interactively.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    *   Tickit::Widget::Table

        This module lets you browse the table in a terminal. Using the
        Tickit library, the advantages it's supposed to have is mouse
        support. It's still very basic: you either have to specify each
        column width manually or the width of all columns will be the same.
        There's no horizontal scrolling support or a way to see long text in
        a column. Not updated since 2016.

    *   Term::TablePrint

        This module lets you browse the table in a terminal. Provides
        roughly the same features like Tickit::Widget::Table with an extra
        one: you can press Enter on a row to view it as a "card" where each
        column will be displayed vertically, so you can better see a row
        that has many columns or columns with long text.

    *   Text::Table::HTML::DataTables

        Personally, all the terminal modules listed here (Term::TablePrint
        and Tickit::Widget::Table) are currently not satisfactory for me.
        They are not that much better than drawing the text table (using
        something like Text::Table::More or Text::ANSITable) and then piping
        the output through a pager like *less*. At least with *less* you can
        scroll horizontally or perform incremental searching (though not
        interactive filtering of rows).

        Text::Table::HTML::DataTables bundles the wonderful DataTables [1]
        JavaScript library and lets you see your table in a web browser to
        interact with. I use this method the most often (usually through my
        CLI framework and the option "--format=html+datatables" specified
        through my CLIs). The main advantage is incremental
        searching/filtering. DataTables also lets you hide/show/reorder
        columns, change the page size, and so on. This is leaps and bounds
        more useful than simply scrolling pages of text provided by
        Tickit::Widget::Table or Term::TablePrint.
