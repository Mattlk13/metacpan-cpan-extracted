NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively - List of modules for
    browsing table data interactively

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of
    Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-BrowsingTableInteractively), released on 2022-03-18.

DESCRIPTION
    This list catalogs are some options on CPAN if you have a table data
    (typically as an array of arrayrefs) and want to browse it
    interactively.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    *   Tickit::Widget::Table - table widget with support for
        scrolling/paging

        Author: TEAM <https://metacpan.org/author/TEAM>

        This module lets you browse the table in a terminal. Using the
        Tickit library, the advantages it's supposed to have is mouse
        support. It's still very basic: you either have to specify each
        column width manually or the width of all columns will be the same.
        There's no horizontal scrolling support or a way to see long text in
        a column. Not updated since 2016.

    *   Term::TablePrint - Print a table to the terminal and browse it
        interactively.

        Author: KUERBIS <https://metacpan.org/author/KUERBIS>

        This module lets you browse the table in a terminal. Provides
        roughly the same features like Tickit::Widget::Table with an extra
        one: you can press Enter on a row to view it as a "card" where each
        column will be displayed vertically, so you can better see a row
        that has many columns or columns with long text.

    *   Text::Table::HTML::DataTables - Generate HTML table with jQuery and
        DataTables plugin

        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        Personally, all the terminal modules listed here (Term::TablePrint
        and Tickit::Widget::Table) are currently not satisfactory for me.
        They are not that much better than drawing the text table (using
        something like Text::Table::More or Text::ANSITable) and then piping
        the output through a pager like *less*. At least with *less* you can
        scroll horizontally or perform incremental searching (though not
        interactive filtering of rows).

        Text::Table::HTML::DataTables bundles the wonderful DataTables [1]
        JavaScript library and lets you see your table in a web browser to
        interact with. I use this method the most often (usually through my
        CLI framework and the option "--format=html+datatables" specified
        through my CLIs). The main advantage is incremental
        searching/filtering. DataTables also lets you hide/show/reorder
        columns, change the page size, and so on. This is leaps and bounds
        more useful than simply scrolling pages of text provided by
        Tickit::Widget::Table or Term::TablePrint.

    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n BrowsingTableInteractively

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries BrowsingTableInteractively | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=BrowsingTableInteractively -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::BrowsingTableInteractively::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
