NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Set - List of modules that deal with sets

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::Set (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Set), released on 2022-03-18.

DESCRIPTION
    Set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any
    particular order.

    In Perl, you can implement set with a hash, with O(1) for average search
    speed. The downside is hash keys are limited to strings, but you can
    store complex data structures as values with some simple workaround.
    Less preferrably, you can also use an array to implement a hash, with
    O(n) for all insertion/deletion/search speed as you need to compare all
    array elements first for (uniqueness of) values. Finally, you can choose
    from various existing CPAN modules that handle sets.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    *   Set::Light - (memory efficient) unordered set of strings

        Author: RRWO <https://metacpan.org/author/RRWO>

        Basically just a hash underneath. You are limited to storing strings
        as values. Does not provide interset operations.

    *   Set::Tiny - Simple sets of strings

        Author: TRENDELS <https://metacpan.org/author/TRENDELS>

        Uses hash underneath, so you are also limited to storing strings as
        values. but unlike Set::Light, provides more methods.

    *   Array::Set - Perform set operations on arrays

        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        Performs set operations on array

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Set

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Set | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=Set -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Set -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Set::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
