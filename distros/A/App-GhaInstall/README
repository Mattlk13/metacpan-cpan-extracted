NAME
    App::GhaInstall - provides the gha-install command

SYNOPSIS
    Install dependencies for a distribution, assuming you're in the distro's
    root directory (where Makefile.PL and META.json live):

      $ gha-install --configure
      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ gha-install --auto

    Install things by name:

      $ gha-install HTTP::Tiny

    Install things by name, but ignore failures:

      $ gha-install --allow-fail HTTP::Tiny

DESCRIPTION
    This is a wrapper around App::cpanminus, App::cpm, or CPAN, depending on
    what is available. Mostly because App::cpanminus doesn't work on Perl 5.6.

    Copies of YAML::Tiny and JSON::Tiny are bundled, just in case.

    `gha-install` is intended to be packable with App::FatPacker.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=App-GhaInstall>.

SEE ALSO
    App::cpanminus, App::cpm, CPAN.
