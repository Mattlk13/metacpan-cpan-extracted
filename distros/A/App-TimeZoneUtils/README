NAME
    App::TimeZoneUtils - An assortment of time-zone-related CLI utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::TimeZoneUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-TimeZoneUtils), released on 2021-09-06.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities related
    to time zones:

    *   detect-local-time-zone

FUNCTIONS
  detect_local_time_zone
    Usage:

     detect_local_time_zone() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Detect local time zone.

    Currently uses DateTime::TimeZone, which has several heuristics itself
    (please see the module for more details). When local time zone cannot be
    determined, it dies.

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
