NAME

    Alien::unzip - Find or build Info-ZIP unzip

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::unzip
     use Env qw( @PATH );
    
     # Add unzip to the PATH if it isn't there already
     push @PATH, Alien::unzip->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION

    This is an alien that provides Info-ZIP unzip. It is useful for
    building other aliens in share mode. Another option is to use
    Archive::Zip, but that module seems to be quite unreliable in practice.
