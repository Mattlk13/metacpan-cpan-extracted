NAME
    App::PDFUtils - Command-line utilities related to PDF files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of App::PDFUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-PDFUtils), released on 2021-10-13.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides tha following command-line utilities related
    to PDF files:

    *   add-pdf-password

    *   compress-pdf

    *   grep-from-pdf

    *   pdf-has-password

    *   pdfgrep

    *   remove-pdf-password

FUNCTIONS
  add_pdf_password
    Usage:

     add_pdf_password(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Password-protect PDF files.

    This program is a wrapper for qpdf to password-protect PDF files
    (in-place). This is the counterpart for remove-pdf-password.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   backup => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to backup the original file to ORIG~.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

    *   password* => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  compress_pdf
    Usage:

     compress_pdf(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Make PDF smaller.

    This utility is a wrapper for gs (GhostScript) and is equivalent to the
    following command:

     % gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf

    with support for multiple files and output files automatically named
    "INPUT.compressed.pdf".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    *   setting => *str* (default: "ebook")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  convert_pdf_to_text
    Usage:

     convert_pdf_to_text(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Convert PDF file to text.

    This utility uses one of the following backends:

    *   pdftotext

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file* => *filename*

        Input file.

    *   fmt => *bool*

        Run Unix fmt over the txt output.

    *   output => *filename*

        Output path.

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    *   pages => *uint_range*

        Only convert a range of pages.

    *   return_output_file => *bool*

        Return the path of output file instead.

        This is useful when you do not specify an output file but do not
        want to show the converted document to stdout, but instead want to
        get the path to a temporary output file.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  pdf_has_password
    Usage:

     pdf_has_password(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check if PDF file has password.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file* => *filename*

        Input file.

    *   quiet => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  remove_pdf_password
    Usage:

     remove_pdf_password(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Remove password from PDF files.

    This program is a wrapper for qpdf to remove passwords from PDF files
    (in-place).

    The motivation for this program is the increasing occurence of financial
    institutions sending financial statements or documents in the format of
    password-protected PDF file. This is annoying when we want to archive
    the file or use it in an organization because we have to remember
    different passwords for different financial institutions and re-enter
    the password everytime we want to use the file. (The banks could've sent
    the PDF in a password-protected .zip, or use PGP-encrypted email, but I
    digress.)

    You can provide the passwords to be tried in a configuration file,
    "~/remove-pdf-password.conf", e.g.:

     passwords = pass1
     passwords = pass2
     passwords = pass3

    or:

     passwords = ["pass1", "pass2", "pass3"]

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   backup => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to backup the original file to ORIG~.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

    *   passwords => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
