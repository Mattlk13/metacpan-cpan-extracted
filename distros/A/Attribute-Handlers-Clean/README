Attribute::Handlers::Clean - Simpler definition of attribute handlers, without messing with UNIVERSAL.

INTALL:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


On Windows, if using MSVS, replace 'make' by 'nmake'. With MinGW, make should work just fine.
On both cases, make sure you are running commands from a command prompt that has loaded the
required compiler environment.

In the worst case scenario, since this is not an XS module, you can just copy the folder 'Attribute'
that you can find inside of the folder 'lib', into your Perl site/lib path (e.g. C:\Perl\site\lib).

After proper install, you can find the documentation via `perldoc Attribute::Handlers::Clean`.
Or you can see it directly on MetaCPAN.
