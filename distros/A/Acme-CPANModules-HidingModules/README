NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::HidingModules - Simulate the unavailability of
    modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::HidingModules (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-HidingModules), released on 2019-01-10.

DESCRIPTION
    Simulate the unavailability of modules.

    The tools listed here can simulate the absence of modules, usually for
    testing purposes. For example, you have Foo::Bar installed but want to
    test how your code would behave when Foo::Bar is not installed.

    These tools usually work by installing a require() hook in @INC. If the
    hook sees that you are trying to load one of the target modules, it dies
    instead.

    *   lib::disallow
