NAME
    App::VivaldiUtils - Utilities related to the Vivaldi browser

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::VivaldiUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-VivaldiUtils), released on 2019-12-10.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to the Vivaldi
    browser:

    *   kill-vivaldi

    *   pause-vivaldi

    *   ps-vivaldi

    *   terminate-vivaldi

    *   unpause-vivaldi

    *   vivaldi-is-paused

FUNCTIONS
  pause_vivaldi
    Usage:

     pause_vivaldi(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Pause (kill -STOP) Vivaldi.

    A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite
    browser's power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser
    often still eat considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the
    background. Stopping (kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and
    effective way to stop CPU eating on Unix. It can be performed whenever
    you are not using your browsers for a little while, e.g. when you are
    typing on an editor or watching a movie. When you want to use your
    browser again, simply unpause it.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

     ps_vivaldi(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]
