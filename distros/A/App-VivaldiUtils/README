NAME
    App::VivaldiUtils - Utilities related to the Vivaldi browser

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of App::VivaldiUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-VivaldiUtils), released on 2022-07-24.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to the Vivaldi
    browser:

    *   kill-vivaldi

    *   list-vivaldi-profiles

    *   pause-vivaldi

    *   ps-vivaldi

    *   restart-vivaldi

    *   start-vivaldi

    *   terminate-vivaldi

    *   unpause-vivaldi

    *   vivaldi-has-processes

    *   vivaldi-is-paused

    *   vivaldi-is-running

FUNCTIONS
  pause_vivaldi
    Usage:

     pause_vivaldi(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Pause (kill -STOP) Vivaldi.

    A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite
    browser's power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser
    often still eat considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the
    background. Pausing (kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and
    effective way to stop CPU eating on Unix and prolong your laptop battery
    life. It can be performed whenever you are not using your browser for a
    little while, e.g. when you are typing on an editor or watching a movie.
    When you want to use your browser again, simply unpause (kill -CONT) it.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   users => *array[unix::uid::exists]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  ps_vivaldi
    Usage:

     ps_vivaldi(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List Vivaldi processes.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
