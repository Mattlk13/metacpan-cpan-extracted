NAME
    App::genpw - Generate random password, with patterns and wordlists

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of App::genpw (from Perl
    distribution App-genpw), released on 2018-07-01.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script genpw.

FUNCTIONS
  genpw
    Usage:

     genpw(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Generate random password, with patterns and wordlists.

    This is yet another utility to generate random password. Features:

    *   Allow specifying pattern(s), e.g. '%8a%s' means 8 random
        alphanumeric characters followed by a symbol.

    *   Use words from wordlists.

    *   Use strong random source when available, otherwise fallback to
        Perl's builtin "rand()".

    Examples:

    By default generate base56 password 12-20 characters long (-p %12$20B):

     % genpw
     Uk7Zim6pZeMTZQUyaM

    Generate 5 passwords instead of 1:

     % genpw 5
     igYiRhUb5t9d9f3J
     b7D44pnxZHJGQzDy2eg
     RXDtqjMvp2hNAdQ
     Xz3DmAL94akqtZ5xb
     7TfANv9yxAaMGXm

    Generate random digits between 10 and 12 characters long:

     % genpw -p '%10$12d'
     55597085674

    Generate password in the form of a random word + 4 random digits. Words
    will be fed from STDIN:

     % genpw -p '%w%4d' < /usr/share/dict/words
     shafted0412

    Like the above, but words will be fetched from "WordList::*" modules.
    You need to install the genpw-wordlist CLI. By default, will use
    wordlist from WordList::EN::Enable:

     % genpw-wordlist -p '%w%4d'
     sedimentologists8542

    Generate a random GUID:

     % genpw -p '%8h-%4h-%4h-%4h-%12h'
     ff26d142-37a8-ecdf-c7f6-8b6ae7b27695

    Like the above, but in uppercase:

     % genpw -p '%8h-%4h-%4h-%4h-%12h' -U
     22E13D9E-1187-CD95-1D05-2B92A09E740D

    Use configuration file to avoid typing the pattern every time, put this
    in "~/genpw.conf":

     [profile=guid]
     patterns = "%8h-%4h-%4h-%4h-%12h"

    then:

     % genpw -P guid
     008869fa-177e-3a46-24d6-0900a00e56d5

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   case => *str* (default: "default")

        Force casing.

        "default" means to not change case. "random" changes casing some
        letters randomly to lower-/uppercase. "lower" forces lower case.
        "upper" forces UPPER CASE. "title" forces Title case.

    *   len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this exact length.

    *   max_len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this maximum length.

    *   min_len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this minimum length.

    *   num => *int* (default: 1)

    *   patterns => *array[str]*

        Pattern(s) to use.

        A pattern is string that is similar to a printf pattern. %P (where P
        is certain letter signifying a format) will be replaced with some
        other string. %Nw (where N is a number) will be replaced by a word
        of length N, %N$MP (where N and M is a number) will be replaced by a
        word of length between N and M. Anything else will be used as-is.
        Available conversions:

         %l   Random Latin letter (A-Z, a-z)
         %d   Random digit (0-9)
         %h   Random hexdigit (0-9a-f)
         %a   Random letter/digit (Alphanum) (A-Z, a-z, 0-9; combination of %l and %d)
         %s   Random ASCII symbol, e.g. "-" (dash), "_" (underscore), etc.
         %x   Random letter/digit/ASCII symbol (combination of %a and %s)
         %m   Base64 character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /)
         %b   Base58 character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 minus IOl0)
         %B   Base56 character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 minus IOol01)
         %%   A literal percent sign
         %w   Random word

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
