NAME
    App::genpw - (Gen)erate random password/strings, with (p)atterns and
    (w)ordlists

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.013 of App::genpw (from Perl
    distribution App-genpw), released on 2024-01-16.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script genpw.

FUNCTIONS
  genpw
    Usage:

     genpw(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    (Gen)erate random password/strings, with (p)atterns and (w)ordlists.

    This is yet another utility to generate random password. Features:

    *   Allow specifying pattern(s), e.g. '%8a%s' means 8 random
        alphanumeric characters followed by a symbol.

    *   Use words from wordlists.

    *   Use strong random source when available, otherwise fallback to
        Perl's builtin rand().

    Examples:

    By default generate base56 password 12-20 characters long (-p %12$20B):

     % genpw
     Uk7Zim6pZeMTZQUyaM

    Generate 5 passwords instead of 1:

     % genpw 5
     igYiRhUb5t9d9f3J
     b7D44pnxZHJGQzDy2eg
     RXDtqjMvp2hNAdQ
     Xz3DmAL94akqtZ5xb
     7TfANv9yxAaMGXm

    Generate random digits between 10 and 12 characters long:

     % genpw -p '%10$12d'
     55597085674

    Generate password in the form of a random word + 4 random digits. Words
    will be fed from STDIN:

     % genpw -p '%w%4d' < /usr/share/dict/words
     shafted0412

    Like the above, but words will be fetched from "WordList::*" modules.
    You need to install the genpw-wordlist CLI. By default, will use
    wordlist from WordList::EN::Enable:

     % genpw -p '%(wordlist:EN::Enable)w%4d'
 
     % genpw-wordlist -p '%w%4d'
     sedimentologists8542

    Generate a random GUID:

     % genpw -p '%8h-%4h-%4h-%4h-%12h'
     ff26d142-37a8-ecdf-c7f6-8b6ae7b27695

    Like the above, but in uppercase:

     % genpw -p '%(u)8h-%(u)4h-%(u)4h-%(u)4h-%(u)12h'
     CA333840-6132-33A1-9C31-F2FF20EDB3EA
 
     % genpw -p '%()(Str::uc)8h-%()(Str::uc)4h-%()(Str::uc)4h-%()(Str::uc)4h-%()(Str::uc)12h'
     CA333840-6132-33A1-9C31-F2FF20EDB3EA
 
     % genpw -p '%8h-%4h-%4h-%4h-%12h' -U
     22E13D9E-1187-CD95-1D05-2B92A09E740D

    Use configuration file to avoid typing the pattern every time, put this
    in "~/genpw.conf":

     [profile=guid]
     patterns = "%8h-%4h-%4h-%4h-%12h"

    then:

     % genpw -P guid
     008869fa-177e-3a46-24d6-0900a00e56d5

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action => *str* (default: "gen")

        (No description)

    *   case => *str* (default: "default")

        Force casing.

        "default" means to not change case. "random" changes casing some
        letters randomly to lower-/uppercase. "lower" forces lower case.
        "upper" forces UPPER CASE. "title" forces Title case.

    *   len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this exact length.

    *   max_len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this maximum length.

    *   min_len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this minimum length.

    *   num => *int* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   patterns => *array[str]*

        Pattern(s) to use.

        CONVERSION (%P). A pattern is string that is roughly similar to a
        printf pattern:

         %P

        where "P" is certain letter signifying a conversion. This will be
        replaced with some other string according to the conversion. An
        example is the %h conversion which will be replaced with hexdigit.

        LENGTH (%NP). A non-negative integer ("N") can be specified before
        the conversion to signify desired length, for example, %4w will
        return a random word of length 4.

        MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM LENGTH ("%M$NP"). If two non-negative integers
        separated by "$" is specified before the conversion, this specify
        desired minimum and maximum length. For example, "%4$10h" will be
        replaced with between 4 and 10 hexdigits.

        ARGUMENT AND FILTERS ("%(arg)P", "%(arg)(filter1)(...)P"). Finally,
        an argument followed by zero or more filters can be specified
        (before the lengths) and before the conversion. For example,
        "%(wordlist:ID::KBBI)w" will be replaced by a random word from the
        wordlist WordList::ID::KBBI. Another example, "%()(Str::uc)4$10h"
        will be replaced by between 4-10 uppercase hexdigits, and
        "%(arraydata:Sample::DeNiro)(Str::underscore_non_latin_alphanums)(St
        r::lc)(Str::ucfirst)w" will be replaced with a random movie title of
        Robert De Niro, where symbols are replaced with underscore then the
        string will be converted into lowercase and the first character
        uppercased, e.g. "Dear_america_letters_home_from_vietnam".

        Anything else will be left as-is.

        Available conversions:

         %l   Random Latin letter (A-Z, a-z)
         %d   Random digit (0-9)
         %h   Random hexdigit (0-9a-f in lowercase [default] or 0-9A-F in uppercase).
              Known arguments:
              - "u" (to use the uppercase instead of the default lowercase digits)
         %a   Random letter/digit (Alphanum) (A-Z, a-z, 0-9; combination of %l and %d)
         %s   Random ASCII symbol, e.g. "-" (dash), "_" (underscore), etc.
         %x   Random letter/digit/ASCII symbol (combination of %a and %s)
         %m   Base64 character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /)
         %b   Base58 character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 minus IOl0)
         %B   Base56 character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 minus IOol01)
         %%   A literal percent sign
         %w   Random word. Known arguments:
              - "stdin:" (for getting the words from stdin, the default)
              - "wordlist:NAME" (for getting the words from a L<WordList> module)
              - "arraydata:NAME" (for getting the words from an L<ArrayData> module, the
                Role::TinyCommons::Collection::PickItems::RandomPos will be applied).

        Filters are modules in the "Data::Sah::Filter::perl::" namespace.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
