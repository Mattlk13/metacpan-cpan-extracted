NAME
    App::genpw - Generate random password

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::genpw (from Perl
    distribution App-genpw), released on 2018-01-09.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script genpw.

FUNCTIONS
  genpw
    Usage:

     genpw(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Generate random password.

    This is yet another utility to generate random password. Features:

    *   Allow specifying pattern(s), e.g. '%8a%s' means 8 random
        alphanumeric characters followed by a symbol.

    *   Use strong random source (Math::Random::Secure) when available,
        otherwise fallback to Perl's builtin "rand()".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   case => *str* (default: "default")

        Force casing.

        "default" means to not change case. "random" changes casing some
        letters randomly to lower-/uppercase. "lower" forces lower case.
        "upper" forces UPPER CASE. "title" forces Title case.

    *   len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this exact length.

    *   max_len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this maximum length.

    *   min_len => *posint*

        If no pattern is supplied, will generate random alphanum characters
        with this minimum length.

    *   num => *int* (default: 1)

    *   patterns => *array[str]*

        Pattern(s) to use.

        A pattern is string that is similar to a printf pattern. %P (where P
        is certain letter signifying a format) will be replaced with some
        other string. %Nw (where N is a number) will be replaced by a word
        of length N, %N$MP (where N and M is a number) will be replaced by a
        word of length between N and M. Anything else will be used as-is.
        Available conversions:

         %l   Random Latin letter (A-Z, a-z)
         %d   Random digit (0-9)
         %a   Random letter/digit (Alphanum) (A-Z, a-z, 0-9; combination of %l and %d)
         %s   Random ASCII symbol, e.g. "-" (dash), "_" (underscore), etc.
         %x   Random letter/digit/ASCII symbol (combination of %a and %s)
         %%   A literal percent sign
         %w   Random word

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
