App::Glacier
============

Command line utility for working with Amazon Glacier, an online file storage 
web service that provides storage for data archiving and backup.

Usage:

  glacier COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

The COMMAND requests a particular action, such as ls (list), get, or put.

The tool uses versioned file naming scheme, sp that multiple copies of the
same file can be kept. Files are versioned in reverse chronological order,
so that version 1 refers to the latest copy, 2 to the penultimate copy, and
so on.

Examples:

1. List vaults

  glacier ls

2. List files in a vault, using detailed output format.

  glacier ls -l VAULT

3. Get latest version of FILE from the vault:

  glacier get VAULT FILE

4. Get the penultimate version of FILE:

  glacier get VAULT 'FILE;2'

5. Store the file:

  glacier put VAULT FILE

6. Create a vault:

  glacier mkvault NEWNAME
