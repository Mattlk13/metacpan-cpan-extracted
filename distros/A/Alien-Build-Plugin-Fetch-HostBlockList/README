NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::HostBlockList - Reject any Alien::Build
    fetch requests going to hosts in the block list

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    Using with environment variables only:

     export ALIEN_BUILD_PRELOAD=Fetch::HostBlockList
     export ALIEN_BUILD_HOST_BLOCK=badsite1.com,badsite2.org

    Using from ~/.alienbuild/rc.pl:

     preload sub {
       my($meta) = @_;
       $meta->apply_plugin('Fetch::HostBlockList', block_hosts => [qw( badsite1.com badsite2.org )])
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This is an Alien::Build plugin that will, when enabled, reject any
    fetch requests made by an Alien::Build based Alien that are fetching
    from a remote host that is on the block list.

    Aliens that bundle packages are not affected, as this plugin does not
    check file URLs.

    If now block list is specified (either via the property or environment
    variable, see below), then not hosts will be blocked.

PROPERTIES

 block_hosts

     plugin 'Fetch::HostBlockList', block_list => \@hosts;

    The list of domains that will be blocked. Should be provided as an
    array reference. If not provided, then ALIEN_BUILD_HOST_BLOCK will be
    used (see below).

ENVIRONMENT

    ALIEN_BUILD_HOST_BLOCK

      Comma separated list of hosts to block. If not specified when the
      plugin is applied then this list will be used.
