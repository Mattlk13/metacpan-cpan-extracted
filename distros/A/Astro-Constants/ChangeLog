v0.10
=====
A couple of interface-breaking changes:
* 'list_constants' and 'describe_constant' have been removed and
	people are directed to the docs, 'perldoc Astro::Constants'
* 'precision' is broken at the moment and will be fixed in the next version

These changes are enhancements/improvements:
* Short name constants are now *actually* constant and cannot be assigned to
* Values are now stored in an XML file, PhysicalConstants.xml
* Values have been updated using NIST's CODATA 2014 and the IAU 2009/2012
	System of Astronomical Constants
* Long names have an added alternate name to facilitate migrating from
	adjective_noun to noun_adjective.

Candidates for removal
======================

HUBBLE_TIME - this constant is inherited from Jeremy Bailin's Astroconst.
	It is the inverse of the Hubble constant, valued at 100 km/s/Mpc and
	is not constant.  Suggest moving it into Astro::Cosmology

Introduced
==========
MASS_ALPHA	- mass of the alpha particle
