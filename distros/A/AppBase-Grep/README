NAME
    AppBase::Grep - A base for grep-like CLI utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of AppBase::Grep (from Perl
    distribution AppBase-Grep), released on 2021-07-01.

FUNCTIONS
  grep
    Usage:

     grep(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    A base for grep-like CLI utilities.

    This routine provides a base for grep-like CLI utilities. It accepts
    coderef as source of lines, which in the actual utilities can be from
    files or other sources. It provides common options like "-i", "-v",
    "-c", color highlighting, and so on.

    Examples of CLI utilities that are based on this: abgrep, grep-coin
    (from App::CryptoCurrencyUtils).

    Why? For grepping lines from files or stdin, abgrep is no match for the
    standard grep (or its many alternatives): it's orders of magnitude
    slower and currently has fewer options. But AppBase::Grep is a quick way
    to create grep-like utilities that grep from a custom sources but have
    common/standard grep features.

    Compared to the standard grep, AppBase::Grep also has these unique
    features:

    *   "--all" option to match all patterns instead of just one;

    *   observe the "COLOR" environment variable to set "--color" default;

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all => *true*

        Require all patterns to match, instead of just one.

    *   color => *str* (default: "auto")

    *   count => *true*

        Supress normal output, return a count of matching lines.

    *   dash_prefix_inverts => *bool*

        When given pattern that starts with dash "-FOO", make it to mean
        "^(?!.*FOO)".

        This is a convenient way to search for lines that do not match a
        pattern. Instead of using "-v" to invert the meaning of all
        patterns, this option allows you to invert individual pattern using
        the dash prefix, which is also used by Google search and a few other
        search engines.

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        Invert the sense of matching.

    *   line_number => *true*

    *   pattern => *str*

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   regexps => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  NO_COLOR
    If set, will disable color. Takes precedence over "COLOR" but not
    "--color".

  COLOR
    Boolean. If set to true, will set default "--color" to "always" instead
    of "auto". If set to false, will set default "--color" to "never"
    instead of "auto". This behavior is not in GNU grep.

  COLOR_THEME
    String. Will search color themes in "AppBase::Grep::ColorTheme::*" as
    well as "Generic::ColorTheme::*" modules.
