NAME
    AppBase::Grep - A base for grep-like CLI utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of AppBase::Grep (from Perl
    distribution AppBase-Grep), released on 2018-01-30.

FUNCTIONS
  grep
    Usage:

     grep(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    A base for grep-like CLI utilities.

    This routine provides a base for grep-like CLI utilities. It accepts
    coderef as source of lines, which in the actual utilities can be from
    files or other sources. It provides common options like "-i", "-v",
    "-c", color highlighting, and so on.

    Examples of CLI utilities that are based on this: abgrep, grep-coin
    (from App::CryptoCurrencyUtils).

    Why? For grepping lines from files or stdin, abgrep is no match for the
    standard grep (or its many alternatives): it's orders of magnitude
    slower and currently has fewer options. But AppBase::Grep is a quick way
    to create grep-like utilities that greps from a custom sources but have
    common features with the standard grep.

    Compared to the standard grep, AppBase::Grep also has these unique
    features:

    *   "--all" option to match all patterns instead of just one;

    *   observe the "COLOR" environment variable to set "--color" default;

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all => *true*

        Require all patterns to match, instead of just one.

    *   color => *str*

    *   count => *true*

        Supress normal output, return a count of matching lines.

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        Invert the sense of matching.

    *   line_number => *true*

    *   pattern => *re*

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   regexps => *array[re]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  COLOR
    Boolean. If set to true, will set default "--color" to "always" instead
    of "auto". If set to false, will set default "--color" to "never"
    instead of "auto". This behavior is not in GNU grep.
