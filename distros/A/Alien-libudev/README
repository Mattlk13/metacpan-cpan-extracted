NAME

    Alien::libudev - Perl distribution for libudev

INSTALL

        cpan Alien::libudev

eudev

    Apparently, you can't build libudev separately from systemd anymore.
    Some Gentoo developers have forked udev as eudev, with the aim of
    keeping it isolated from systemd. This is what this module builds.

    If you prefer systemd's libudev, install it over your distro's package
    manager. e.g. on Debian:

        sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

    Installing this module on a system with systemd's libudev is
    effectively a no-op.
