=head1 NAME

pwhich - Pure Perl implementation of which

=head1 VERSION

version 1.15

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ pwhich perl
 $ pwhich -a perl          # print all matches
 $ pwhich perl perldoc ... # look for multiple programs
 $ pwhich -a perl perldoc ...
 $ pwhich -s perl          # silent mode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pwhich> is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
programs based on the user's C<PATH>. It is similar to the usually Unix
tool `which', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
purely in Perl (uses the module C<File::Which>), so is portable.

=head2 Calling syntax

 $ pwhich [-a] [-s] [-v] programname [programname ...]

=head2 Options

=over

=item -a

The option I<-a> will make C<pwhich> print all matches found in the
C<PATH> variable instead of just the first one. Each match is printed
on a separate line.

=item -s

No output, just return 0 if any of the executables are found, or 1
if none are found.

=item -v

Prints version (of C<File::Which>) and copyright notice and exits.

This module purports to "check that a command is available", but does not

provide any documentation on how you might use it.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module does not know about built-in shell commands, as the built-in
command C<which> and C<where> ususally do.

This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1.  It may work on 5.8.0.
