        description => <<'_',

If set to true, will take into account the actual delay (timestamp difference).
For example, when using the Constant strategy of delay=2, you log failure()
again right after the previous failure() (i.e. specify the same timestamp).
failure() will then return ~2+2 = 4 seconds. On the other hand, if you waited 2
seconds before calling failure() again (i.e. specify the timestamp that is 2
seconds larger than the previous timestamp), failure() will return 2 seconds.
And if you waited 4 seconds or more, failure() will return 0.

        default => 0,
        tags => ['common'],
        description => <<'_',

If set to a positive number, will limit the number of seconds for all of the
attempts. This setting is used to limit the amount of time you are willing to
spend on a task. For example, when using the Exponential strategy of
initial_delay=3 and max_attempts=10, the delays will be 3, 6, 12, 24, ... If
failures are logged according to the suggested delays, and max_actual_duration
is set to 21 seconds, then the third failure() will return -1 instead of 24
because 3+6+12 >= 21, even though max_attempts has not been exceeded.

        schema => 'uint*',
        default => 0,
        tags => ['common'],
        description => <<'_',

0 means to retry endlessly without ever giving up. 1 means to give up after a
single failure (i.e. no retry attempts). 2 means to retry once after a failure.
Note that after a success, the number of attempts is reset (as expected). So if
max_attempts is 3, and if you fail twice then succeed, then on the next failure
the algorithm will retry again for a maximum of 3 times.

        tags => ['common'],
        description => <<'_',

If you set this to a value larger than 0, the actual delay will be between a
random number between original_delay * (1-jitter_factor) and original_delay *
(1+jitter_factor). Jitters are usually added to avoid so-called "thundering
herd" problem.

=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Backoff - Various backoff strategies for retry

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.006 of Algorithm::Backoff (from Perl distribution Algorithm-Backoff), released on 2019-06-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # 1. pick a strategy and instantiate

 use Algorithm::Backoff::Constant;
 my $ab = Algorithm::Backoff::Constant->new(
     delay             => 2, # required
     #delay_on_success => 0, # optional, default 0
 );

 # 2. log success/failure and get a new number of seconds to delay, timestamp is
 # optional but must be monotonically increasing.

 my $secs = $ab->failure(); # => 2
 my $secs = $ab->success(); # => 0
 my $secs = $ab->failure(); # => 2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution provides several classes that implement various backoff
strategies for setting delay between retry attempts.

This class (C<Algorithm::Backoff>) is a base class only.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 new

Usage:

 new(%args) -> obj

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<jitter_factor> => I<float>

How much to add randomness.

If you set this to a value larger than 0, the actual delay will be between a
random number between original_delay * (1-jitter_factor) and original_delay *
(1+jitter_factor). Jitters are usually added to avoid so-called "thundering
herd" problem.

The jitter will be applied to delay on failure as well as on success.

=item * B<max_attempts> => I<uint> (default: 0)

Maximum number consecutive failures before giving up.

0 means to retry endlessly without ever giving up. 1 means to give up after a
single failure (i.e. no retry attempts). 2 means to retry once after a failure.
Note that after a success, the number of attempts is reset (as expected). So if
max_attempts is 3, and if you fail twice then succeed, then on the next failure
the algorithm will retry again for a maximum of 3 times.

=back

Return value:  (obj)


=head2 success

Usage:

 my $secs = $obj->success([ $timestamp ]);

Log a successful attempt. If not specified, C<$timestamp> defaults to current
time. Will return the suggested number of seconds to wait before doing another
attempt.

=head2 failure

Usage:

 my $secs = $obj->failure([ $timestamp ]);

Log a failed attempt. If not specified, C<$timestamp> defaults to current time.
Will return the suggested number of seconds to wait before doing another
attempt, or -1 if it suggests that one gives up (e.g. if C<max_attempts>
parameter has been exceeded).
