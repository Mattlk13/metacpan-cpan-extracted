=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Backoff::Constant - Backoff using a constant delay

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.004 of Algorithm::Backoff::Constant (from Perl distribution Algorithm-Backoff), released on 2019-06-05.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Algorithm::Backoff::Constant;

 # 1. instantiate

 my $ab = Algorithm::Backoff::Constant->new(
     #consider_actual_delay => 1, # optional, default 0
     #max_actual_duration   => 0, # optional, default 0 (retry endlessly)
     #max_attempts          => 0, # optional, default 0 (retry endlessly)
     #jitter_factor         => 0, # optional, set to positive value to add randomness
     delay                  => 2, # required
     #delay_on_success      => 0, # optional, default 0
 );

 # 2. log success/failure and get a new number of seconds to delay, timestamp is
 # optional argument (default is current time) but must be monotonically
 # increasing.

 my $secs = $ab->failure(1554652553); # => 2
 my $secs = $ab->success();           # => 0
 my $secs = $ab->failure();           # => 2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This backoff strategy is one of the simplest: it waits X second(s) after each
failure, or Y second(s) (default 0) after a success. There are limits on the
number of attempts (`max_attempts`) and total duration (`max_actual_duration`).
Some randomness can be introduced to avoid "thundering herd problem".

=head1 METHODS


=head2 new

Usage:

 new(%args) -> obj

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<consider_actual_delay> => I<bool> (default: 0)

Whether to consider actual delay.

If set to true, will take into account the actual delay (timestamp difference).
For example, when using the Constant strategy of delay=2, you log failure()
again right after the previous failure() (i.e. specify the same timestamp).
failure() will then return ~2+2 = 4 seconds. On the other hand, if you waited 2
seconds before calling failure() again (i.e. specify the timestamp that is 2
seconds larger than the previous timestamp), failure() will return 2 seconds.
And if you waited 4 seconds or more, failure() will return 0.

=item * B<delay>* => I<ufloat>

Number of seconds to wait after a failure.

=item * B<delay_on_success> => I<ufloat> (default: 0)

Number of seconds to wait after a success.

=item * B<jitter_factor> => I<float>

How much to add randomness.

If you set this to a value larger than 0, the actual delay will be between a
random number between original_delay * (1-jitter_factor) and original_delay *
(1+jitter_factor). Jitters are usually added to avoid so-called "thundering
herd" problem.

=item * B<max_actual_duration> => I<ufloat> (default: 0)

Maximum number of seconds for all of the attempts (0 means unlimited).

If set to a positive number, will limit the number of seconds for all of the
attempts. This setting is used to limit the amount of time you are willing to
spend on a task. For example, when using the Exponential strategy of
initial_delay=3 and max_attempts=10, the delays will be 3, 6, 12, 24, ... If
failures are logged according to the suggested delays, and max_actual_duration
is set to 21 seconds, then the third failure() will return -1 instead of 24
because 3+6+12 >= 21, even though max_attempts has not been exceeded.

=item * B<max_attempts> => I<uint> (default: 0)

Maximum number consecutive failures before giving up.

0 means to retry endlessly without ever giving up. 1 means to give up after a
single failure (i.e. no retry attempts). 2 means to retry once after a failure.
Note that after a success, the number of attempts is reset (as expected). So if
max_attempts is 3, and if you fail twice then succeed, then on the next failure
the algorithm will retry again for a maximum of 3 times.
