=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Backoff::Exponential - Backoff exponentially

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.004 of Algorithm::Backoff::Exponential (from Perl distribution Algorithm-Backoff), released on 2019-06-05.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Algorithm::Backoff::Exponential;

 # 1. instantiate

 my $ab = Algorithm::Backoff::Exponential->new(
     #consider_actual_delay => 1, # optional, default 0
     #max_actual_duration   => 0, # optional, default 0 (retry endlessly)
     #max_attempts          => 0, # optional, default 0 (retry endlessly)
     #jitter_factor         => 0.25, # optional, default 0
     initial_delay          => 5, # required
     #max_delay             => 100, # optional
     #exponent_base         => 2, # optional, default 2 (binary exponentiation)
     #delay_on_success      => 0, # optional, default 0
 );

 # 2. log success/failure and get a new number of seconds to delay, timestamp is
 # optional but must be monotonically increasing.

 # for example, using the parameters initial_delay=5, max_delay=100:

 my $secs;
 $secs = $ab->failure();   # =>  5 (= initial_delay)
 $secs = $ab->failure();   # => 10 (5 * 2^1)
 $secs = $ab->failure();   # => 20 (5 * 2^2)
 $secs = $ab->failure();   # => 33 (5 * 2^3 - 7)
 $secs = $ab->failure();   # => 80 (5 * 2^4)
 $secs = $ab->failure();   # => 100 ( min(5 * 2^5, 100) )
 $secs = $ab->success();   # => 0 (= delay_on_success)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This backoff algorithm calculates the next delay as:

 initial_delay * exponent_base ** (attempts-1)

Only the C<initial_delay> is required. C<exponent_base> is 2 by default (binary
expoential). For the first failure attempt (C<attempts> = 1) the delay equals
the initial delay. Then it is doubled, quadrupled, and so on (using the default
exponent base of 2).

There are limits on the number of attempts (`max_attempts`) and total duration
(`max_actual_duration`).

It is recommended to add a jitter factor, e.g. 0.25 to add some randomness.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 new

Usage:

 new(%args) -> obj

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<consider_actual_delay> => I<bool> (default: 0)

Whether to consider actual delay.

If set to true, will take into account the actual delay (timestamp difference).
For example, when using the Constant strategy of delay=2, you log failure()
again right after the previous failure() (i.e. specify the same timestamp).
failure() will then return ~2+2 = 4 seconds. On the other hand, if you waited 2
seconds before calling failure() again (i.e. specify the timestamp that is 2
seconds larger than the previous timestamp), failure() will return 2 seconds.
And if you waited 4 seconds or more, failure() will return 0.

=item * B<delay_on_success> => I<ufloat> (default: 0)

Number of seconds to wait after a success.

=item * B<exponent_base> => I<ufloat> (default: 2)

=item * B<initial_delay>* => I<ufloat>

Initial delay for the first attempt after failure, in seconds.

=item * B<jitter_factor> => I<float>

How much to add randomness.

If you set this to a value larger than 0, the actual delay will be between a
random number between original_delay * (1-jitter_factor) and original_delay *
(1+jitter_factor). Jitters are usually added to avoid so-called "thundering
herd" problem.

=item * B<max_actual_duration> => I<ufloat> (default: 0)

Maximum number of seconds for all of the attempts (0 means unlimited).

If set to a positive number, will limit the number of seconds for all of the
attempts. This setting is used to limit the amount of time you are willing to
spend on a task. For example, when using the Exponential strategy of
initial_delay=3 and max_attempts=10, the delays will be 3, 6, 12, 24, ... If
failures are logged according to the suggested delays, and max_actual_duration
is set to 21 seconds, then the third failure() will return -1 instead of 24
because 3+6+12 >= 21, even though max_attempts has not been exceeded.

=item * B<max_attempts> => I<uint> (default: 0)

Maximum number consecutive failures before giving up.

0 means to retry endlessly without ever giving up. 1 means to give up after a
single failure (i.e. no retry attempts). 2 means to retry once after a failure.
Note that after a success, the number of attempts is reset (as expected). So if
max_attempts is 3, and if you fail twice then succeed, then on the next failure
the algorithm will retry again for a maximum of 3 times.

=item * B<max_delay> => I<ufloat>

Maximum delay time, in seconds.
