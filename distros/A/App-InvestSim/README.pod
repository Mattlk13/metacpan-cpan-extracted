=head1 InvestSim - Simulateur d'investissement locatif

=head2 DESCRIPTION

A Perl/Tk application to simulate the return of a rental property investment.
This is tuned for French taxes and benefits and, given that, the application is
entirely localized in French.

Install with:

    sudo apt-get install perl make tcl tk tcllib tklib
    cpan App::InvestSim

And then run it with:

    investment_simulator

Alternatively, you can download a pre-built Windows binary from the GitHub release
page of the project. That binary is a self-installing archive. On the first run it
will unzip itself in a temporary folder, so that first run is quite slow. Subsequent
runs are faster to launch.

=head2 MANUAL INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE

=head3 REQUIREMENTS

    # You probably already have these 3 programs.
    sudo apt-get install perl make git

    # You need tcl/tk installed for the GUI of the program
    sudo apt-get install tcl tk tcllib tklib

    # These Perl modules are needed too, but they are installed
    # automatically if you install the program with cpan:
    cpan Tkx CLDR::Number File::HomeDir File::ShareDir File::ShareDir::Install

=head3 INSTALLATION

Once you have the requirements above installed, you can run the following
commands to install the program:

    git clone https://github.com/mkende/investment_simulator.git
    cd investment_simulator
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    sudo make install

=head2 DISTRIBUTION

=head3 Creating a self installing Windows binary

If you have a working Windows Perl and TCL/Tk installation, you can create a
self installing binary using the C<Par-Packer> module:

    pp -o investment_simulator.exe -c -x -A pp_includes.txt -I lib \
        --link=C:\TclTk\8.6.9\bin\zlib1.dll script\investment_simulator \
        --gui -M CLDR::Number::Role::Format -cd par.cache \
        -a res\icon.ico;res\icon.ico

The C<pp_includes.txt> file should contain the following content (of course,
the path should be fixed for the version of TCL, Tk, and tklib that you
have installed):

    C:\TclTk\8.6.9\bin\tcl86.dll;tcl\bin\tcl86.dll
    C:\TclTk\8.6.9\bin\tk86.dll;tcl\bin\tk86.dll
    C:\TclTk\8.6.9\lib\tcl8;tcl\lib\tcl8
    C:\TclTk\8.6.9\lib\tcl8.6;tcl\lib\tcl8.6
    C:\TclTk\8.6.9\lib\tk8.6;tcl\lib\tk8.6
    C:\TclTk\8.6.9\lib\tklib0.6\tooltip;tcl\lib\tooltip
