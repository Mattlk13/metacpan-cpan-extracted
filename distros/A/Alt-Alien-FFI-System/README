NAME

    Alt::Alien::FFI::System - (Deprecated) Simplified alternative to
    Alien::FFI that uses system libffi

VERSION

    version 0.23

SYNOPSIS

     env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm Alt::Alien::FFI::System

DESCRIPTION

    DEPRECATED: As noted below, this distribution was intended for use by
    system integrators packaging FFI::Platypus that didn't want to add the
    real Alien::FFI and its dependencies to their build chain. As of
    version 0.69, FFI::Platypus will use pkg-config and the system libffi
    if it is already installed, and skip the install of Alien::FFI. Thus,
    this module is now redundant. It may be removed from CPAN, but not
    before January 1st 2020.

    This distribution provides an alternative implementation of Alien::FFI
    that is geared toward system integrators when libffi is provided by the
    operating system. It has no non-core requirements for runtime as of
    Perl 5.8. It now uses use Test::Alien for consistency with the original
    Alien::FFI.

    It will NOT attempt to download or install libffi. If you need that,
    then install the original Alien::FFI instead.

CAVEATS

    Test::Alien is now part of Alien::Build, so if you need to run the
    tests, the prereqs aren't that much lighter than the real ALien::FFI,
    so you should consider:

    do your own testing

    skip tests

    switch to the real Alien::FFI
