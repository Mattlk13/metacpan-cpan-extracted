NAME
    AppBase::Sort - A base for sort-like CLI utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of AppBase::Sort (from Perl
    distribution AppBase-Sort), released on 2024-03-06.

FUNCTIONS
  sort_appbase
    Usage:

     sort_appbase(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    A base for sort-like CLI utilities.

    This routine provides a base for Unix sort-like CLI utilities. It
    accepts coderef as source of lines, which in the actual utilities can be
    from stdin/files or other sources. It provides common options like "-i",
    "-r", and so on.

    Examples of CLI utilities that are based on this: sort-by-example (which
    is included in the "AppBase-Sort" distribution).

    Why? For sorting lines from files or stdin and "standard" sorting
    criteria, this utility is no match for the standard Unix "sort" (or its
    many alternatives). But "AppBase::Sort" is a quick way to create
    sort-like utilities that sort lines from alternative sources and/or
    using custom sort criteria.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

        If set to true, will search case-insensitively.

    *   reverse => *bool*

        Reverse sort order.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
