    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

        Whether to show detailed records.

        The default is to show detailed records when there are more than 1
        filenames specified; when there is only 1 filename, will only show
        dimension in WxH format (e.g. 640x480). If this option is specified,
        will show detailed records even if there is only one filename
        specified.

    *   filenames* => *array[filename]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
