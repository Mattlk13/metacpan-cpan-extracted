               filename => "foo.jpg",
               filesize => 23844,
               width    => 640,
               height   => 480,
               res_name => "VGA",
             },
           ],

             "table.fields" => ["filename", "filesize", "width", "height", "res_name"],
           },

             {
               filename => "foo.jpg",
               filesize => 23844,
               width    => 640,
               height   => 480,
               res_name => "VGA",
             },
             {
               filename => "bar.png",
               filesize => 87374,
               width    => 400,
               height   => 200,
               res_name => undef,
             },
             {
               filename => "baz.txt",
               filesize => 2393,
               width    => 0,
               height   => 0,
               res_name => undef,
             },
           ],
           {
             "table.fields" => ["filename", "filesize", "width", "height", "res_name"],
           },
         ]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

        Whether to show detailed records.

        The default is to show detailed records when there are more than 1
        filenames specified; when there is only 1 filename, will only show
        dimension in WxH format (e.g. 640x480). If this option is specified,
        will show detailed records even if there is only one filename
        specified.

    *   filenames* => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
