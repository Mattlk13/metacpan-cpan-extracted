NAME
    App::ClipboardUtils - CLI utilities related to clipboard

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.008 of App::ClipboardUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-ClipboardUtils), released on 2024-08-30.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains the following CLI utilities related to
    clipboard:

    1. add-clipboard-content
    2. clear-clipboard-content
    3. clear-clipboard-history
    4. clipadd
    5. clipget
    6. detect-clipboard-manager
    7. get-clipboard-content
    8. get-clipboard-history-item
    9. list-clipboard-history

FUNCTIONS
  add_clipboard_content
    Usage:

     add_clipboard_content(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Add a new content to the clipboard.

    For "xclip": when adding content, the primary selection is set. The
    clipboard content is unchanged.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   clipboard_manager => *str*

        Explicitly set clipboard manager to use.

        The default, when left undef, is to detect what clipboard manager is
        running.

    *   content => *str*

        (No description)

    *   split_by => *str_or_re*

        Split content by specified string/regex, add the split content as
        multiple clipboard entries.

    *   tee => *bool*

        If set to true, will output content back to STDOUT.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
