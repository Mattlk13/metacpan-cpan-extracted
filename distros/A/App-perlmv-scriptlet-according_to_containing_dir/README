NAME
    App::perlmv::scriptlet::according_to_containing_dir - Rename file
    according to its containing directory's name, e.g. foo/1.txt to
    foo/foo.txt, or foo/somejpeg to foo/foo.jpg

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    App::perlmv::scriptlet::according_to_containing_dir (from Perl
    distribution App-perlmv-scriptlet-according_to_containing_dir), released
    on 2023-10-26.

DESCRIPTION
    In addition to renaming the file according to the name of its container
    directory, if the file does not have an extension yet, an extension will
    be given by guessing according to its MIME type using
    File::MimeInfo::Magic, similar to what the
    "add_extension_according_to_mime_type" scriptlet does.

ENVIRONMENT
  DEBUG
    Bool. If set to true, will print debugging messages to stderr.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
