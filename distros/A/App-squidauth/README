FUNCTIONS
  squidauth
    Usage:

     squidauth(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    A simple authenticator program for Squid.

    This utility can be used as an authenticator program for Squid. It reads
    users & passwords from a simple, htpasswd-format text file (by default
    at "/etc/proxypasswd") with the format like:

     user1:$apr1$YFFyJK3J$PfuotoLCk7XQqQiH6I3Cb/
     user2:$apr1$NOvdp7LN$YnH5zmfCn0IhNt/fKZdL2.
     ...

    To add entries to this file, you can use htpasswd (usually comes with
    Apache httpd in an OS package like "httpd-tools") to add users to this
    file, e.g.:

     % htpasswd -c /etc/proxypasswd user1
     % htpasswd    /etc/proxypasswd user2
     ...

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   passwd_file => *pathname* (default: "/etc/proxypasswd")

        Location of password file.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
