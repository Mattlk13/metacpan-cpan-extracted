NAME
    App::CrossPericmd - Output the cross product of two or more sets

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::CrossPericmd (from Perl
    distribution App-CrossPericmd), released on 2019-11-29.

FUNCTIONS
  cross
    Usage:

     cross(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Output the cross product of two or more sets.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         cross( aoaos => ["1,2,3", "4,5"]); # -> [[1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 4], [3, 5]]

    This is more or less the same as the cross CLI on CPAN (from
    Set::CrossProduct) except that this CLI is written using the
    Perinci::CmdLine framework. It returns table data which might be more
    easily consumed by other tools.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   aoaos* => *array[array[str]]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
