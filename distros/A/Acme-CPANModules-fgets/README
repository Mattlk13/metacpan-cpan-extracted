NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::fgets - List of fgets() implementations in Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Acme::CPANModules::fgets (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-fgets), released on 2022-03-18.

DESCRIPTION
    Reading a line of data from a filehandle in Perl is easy, but Perl will
    happily slurp line of any length without limit, even gigabytes which can
    cause your script or system to run out of memory.

    "fgets()" is a standard I/O C function to get a line of data with a
    length limit. In many cases you don't need in this Perl but in some
    cases you do. The lack of built-in "fgets()" function in Perl (unlike
    in, say, PHP) is a bit annoying, but no worries because there are
    several CPAN modules that provide you with just that.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    *   PerlIO::fgets - Provides a "fgets()" like function for PerlIO file
        handles

        Author: CHANSEN <https://metacpan.org/author/CHANSEN>

        Can handle piped command fine, but doesn't work well in non-blocking
        mode.

    *   File::fgets - Read either one line or X characters from a file

        Author: MSCHWERN <https://metacpan.org/author/MSCHWERN>

        XS module. Seems to have trouble dealing with piped command. But
        works well in low-throughput situation as well as in non-blocking
        mode.

    *   File::GetLineMaxLength - Get lines from a file, up to a maximum line
        length

        Author: ROBM <https://metacpan.org/author/ROBM>

        Pure-Perl module. Different interface (use an OO wrapper) so a bit
        more cumbersome to use. Uses a fixed 4096-byte block size so doesn't
        work well in low-throughput situation. Doesn't work well in
        non-blocking mode.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n fgets

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries fgets | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=fgets -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::fgets -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::fgets::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
