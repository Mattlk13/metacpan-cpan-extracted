NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::fgets - fgets() implementations in Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::fgets (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-fgets), released on 2018-02-05.

DESCRIPTION
    fgets() implementations in Perl.

    Reading a line of data from a filehandle in Perl is easy, but Perl will
    happily slurp line of any length without limit, even gigabytes which can
    cause your script or system to run out of memory.

    "fgets()" is a standard I/O C function to get a line of data with a
    length limit. In many cases you don't need in this Perl but in some
    cases you do. The lack of built-in "fgets()" function in Perl (unlike
    in, say, PHP) is a bit annoying, but no worries because there are
    several CPAN modules that provide you with just that.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   PerlIO::fgets

        Can handle piped command fine, but doesn't work well in non-blocking
        mode.

    *   File::fgets

        XS module. Seems to have trouble dealing with piped command. But
        works well in low-throughput situation as well as in non-blocking
        mode.

    *   File::GetLineMaxLength

        Pure-Perl module. Different interface (use an OO wrapper) so a bit
        more cumbersome to use. Uses a fixed 4096-byte block size so doesn't
        work well in low-throughput situation. Doesn't work well in
        non-blocking mode.
