NAME
    App::numseq - Generate some number sequences

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::numseq (from Perl
    distribution App-numseq), released on 2021-08-01.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  numseq
    Usage:

     numseq(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate some number sequences.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   name* => *str*

        Sequence name.

    *   params => *array[int]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
