        - returned items are blessed into Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::Utils::Item,
	  rather than myItem, as that's bogus name space pollution.
	- fixed documentation which called the hdu_num attribute hdr_num.
	- routines can now take a handle to an opened file as well
	  as a file name

0.12	2010-12-06T12:31:16-05:00
        - colkeys wasn't finding all of the column associated
	  keywords.  It's now better at this, but may pick up some
	  that shouldn't be picked up.

0.11	2010-06-04T13:44:57-04:00
        - distribution was missing the local Module::Install inc dir.

        - added colkeys.
	- deprecate croak_status; instead use
		   Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::CheckStatus

0.06	2008-02-11T18:15:01-05:00
        - keywords weren't always treated in a case-insensitive fashion

0.05	2003-06-10T16:27:32-04:00
        - added Value option to keypar to return just the values

0.04  2003-03-08T23:09:25-05:00
        - added multiple keywords, OnePerHDU flag.  Should be
	  backwards compatible.

0.03  2003-01-29T16:16:00-05:00
	- convert to use a myItem, derived from an Astro::FITS::Headers::Item;

	  which the keyword was found.
