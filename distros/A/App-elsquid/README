App::elsquid
============

This is the App::elsquid package. It provides the command line tool 'elsquid',
which utilizes the EasyLists (https://easylist.github.io/) to
create database files for central adblocking with Squid/SquidGuard.
Amongst others, it can download and convert these lists, and install
the resulting files.


INSTALLATION

Install this module as you would install any perl module library, 
by running these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DOCUMENTATION

See the Changes file for a list of recent changes. POD style documentation 
should be included in all relevant modules and scripts. These are normally 
converted to manual pages end installed as part of the "make install" process.
You should also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation 
from the module files directly.
