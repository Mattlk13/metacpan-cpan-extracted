NAME
    Acme::Marvel::CinematicUniverse::Characters - example of distributing
    instance data on CPAN

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Marvel::CinematicUniverse::Characters;
  
      say for Acme::Marvel::CinematicUniverse::Characters->find('tony');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is primarily intended as an example of how to distribute
    instances of objects on CPAN.

    It uses characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999)
    rather than the comic book universe, though power grid data is taken from
    the Marvel wiki, and mostly based on the comic books. It currently only
    includes the six core characters from *Marvel's The Avengers* (2012), also
    known as *Avengers Assemble* in the UK and Ireland.

  Methods
    `characters`
        Returns a list of all known characters. In scalar context, returns the
        count of characters.

        Characters are Acme::Marvel::CinematicUniverse::Character objects.

    `find($needle)`
        Given a string or regexp to search for, searches for a character by
        name, returning all the results as a list. In scalar context, returns
        the first match, which may or may not be the "best" match.

        Strings given as search terms are treated case-insensitively. Regexps
        are used as-is, so may or may not be case-sensitive.

        Characters are Acme::Marvel::CinematicUniverse::Character objects.

    `instance_modules`
        Returns a list of modules that have been used to find character data.

    `load_character($character)`
        Used by instance modules to load characters.
