NAME
    App::SeqPericmd - Rinci-/Perinci::CmdLine-based "seq"-like CLI utility

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.050 of App::SeqPericmd (from Perl
    distribution App-SeqPericmd), released on 2021-07-17.

FUNCTIONS
  seq
    Usage:

     seq(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Rinci-/Perinci::CmdLine-based "seq"-like CLI utility.

    This utility is similar to Unix "seq" command, with a few differences:
    some differences in option names, JSON output, allow infinite stream
    (when "to" is not specified).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   equal_width => *bool*

        Equalize width by padding with leading zeros.

    *   from* => *float*

    *   header => *str*

        Add a header row.

    *   increment => *float* (default: 1)

    *   limit => *int*

        Only generate a certain amount of numbers.

    *   number_format => *str*

        sprintf() format for each number.

    *   to => *float*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (array[float])
