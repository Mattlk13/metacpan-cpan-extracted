        Author: MIYAGAWA <https://metacpan.org/author/MIYAGAWA>

        From Plack's documentation: "Plack is like Ruby's Rack or Python's
        Paste for WSGI." Plack and PSGI were created by MIYAGAWA in 2009 and
        were inspired by both Python's WSGI specification (hence the dual
        specification-implementation split) and Ruby's Rack (hence the
        name).

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
