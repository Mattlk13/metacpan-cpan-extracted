=head1 NAME

pcpgrep - Grep from list of installed Perl::Critic policy module names (abstracts, ...)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.006 of pcpgrep (from Perl distribution App-PerlCriticUtils), released on 2021-12-01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

% B<pcpgrep> [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [B<--ignore-case>|B<--no-ignore-case>|B<--noignore-case>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] -- E<lt>I<query>E<gt> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I can never remember the names of the policies, hence this utility. It's a
convenience shortcut for:

 % pcplist | grep SOMETHING
 % pcplist -l | grep SOMETHING

Note that pcplist also can filter:

 % pcplist undef
 % pcplist req strict

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--no-ignore-case>

=item B<--query-json>=I<s>

See C<--query>.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

=item B<--query>=I<s@>*

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pcpgrep pcpgrep

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pcpgrep 'p/*/`pcpgrep`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 EXAMPLES

What's that policy that prohibits returning undef explicitly?:

 % pcpgrep undef
 +------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | name                                     | abstract                                                                                      |
 +------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitSleepViaSelect | Use L<Time::HiRes|Time::HiRes> instead of something like C<select(undef, undef, undef, .05)>. |
 | InputOutput::ProhibitJoinedReadline      | Use C<local $/ = undef> or L<Path::Tiny|Path::Tiny> instead of joined readline.               |
 | Subroutines::ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef | Return failure with bare C<return> instead of C<return undef>.                                |
 +------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

What's that policy that requires using strict?:

 % pcpgrep req strict
 +---------------------------------------+-----------------------+
 | name                                  | abstract              |
 +---------------------------------------+-----------------------+
 | TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict | Always C<use strict>. |

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
