NAME

    Acme::Alien::DontPanic - Test Module for Alien::Base::ModuleBuild

VERSION

    version 2.6500

DESCRIPTION

    Alien::Base comprises base classes to help in the construction of
    Alien:: modules. Modules in the Alien namespace are used to locate and
    install (if necessary) external libraries needed by other Perl modules.

    This module is a toy module to test the efficacy of the
    Alien::Base::ModuleBuild system. This module is depended on by another
    toy module Acme::Ford::Prefect, which needs the libdontpanic library to
    be able to tell us the answer.
