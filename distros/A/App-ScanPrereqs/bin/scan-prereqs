=head1 NAME

scan-prereqs - Scan source code for prerequisites

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of scan-prereqs (from Perl distribution App-ScanPrereqs), released on 2017-03-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % scan-prereqs [options] <file> ...

Examples:

By default scan current directory:

 % scan-prereqs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an alternative CLI to L<scan_prereqs>. This CLI offers alternate
backends: aside from L<Perl::PrereqScanner> you can also use
L<Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite> and L<Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite>. Some
other features: output in various formats (text table, JSON), filter only core
or non-core prerequisites.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--file>=I<s@>*

Default value:

 ["."]

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--files-json>=I<s>

See C<--file>.

=item B<--no-show-core>

=item B<--no-show-noncore>

=item B<--perlver>=I<s>

Perl version to use when determining core/non-core.

The default is the current perl version.


=item B<--scanner>=I<s>

Which scanner to use.

Default value:

 "regular"

Valid values:

 ["regular","lite","nqlite"]

`regular` means <pm:Perl::PrereqScanner> which is PPI-based and is the slowest
but has the most complete support for Perl syntax.

`lite` means <pm:Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite> uses an XS-based lexer and is the
fastest but might miss some Perl syntax (i.e. miss some prereqs) or crash if
given some weird code.

`nqlite` means <pm:Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite> which is faster than
`regular` but not as fast as `lite`.

Read respective scanner's documentation for more details about the pro's and
con's for each scanner.


=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Set log level to debug (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use DEBUG=1).

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging).

=item B<--quiet>

Set log level to quiet (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use QUIET=1).

=item B<--trace>

Set log level to trace (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use TRACE=1).

=item B<--verbose>

Set log level to info (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use VERBOSE=1).

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C scan-prereqs scan-prereqs

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using L<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immediately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete scan-prereqs 'p/*/`scan-prereqs`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/scan-prereqs.conf>, F<~/scan-prereqs.conf>, or F</etc/scan-prereqs.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

List of available configuration parameters:

 files (see --file)
 format (see --format)
 log_level (see --log-level)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)
 perlver (see --perlver)
