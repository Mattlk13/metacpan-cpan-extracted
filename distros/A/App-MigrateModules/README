NAME

    perl-migrate-modules - Migrate installed CPAN modules from one Perl to
    another

SYNOPSIS

      perl-migrate-modules [OPTIONS] [<src-path>] <dest-path>
    
        perl-migrate-modules /path/to/perl-5.28.0 /path/to/perl-5.28.1
        perl-migrate-modules -nq -Ilib /usr/bin/perl ~/bin/perl
        perl-migrate-modules --from ~/perl5/lib/perl5 ~/perls/5.20.0
    
      Options:
        -h, --help                   Show this message
        -f <path>, --from=<path>     Search only these path(s) for source modules
        -I <path>, --lib=<path>      Additional search path(s) for source modules
        -n, --notest                 Skip testing and test dependencies
        -q, --quiet                  Show only installation successes and failures
        -v, --version                Show the version of this script

DESCRIPTION

    Reinstalls all modules found in the source Perl into the destination
    Perl, similar to the clone-modules command for perlbrew or the
    migrate-modules command for plenv <https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv>.
    The Perls may be passed as paths to the base installation directory or
    paths to the perl executable itself. If only one path is passed, it
    will be used as both the source and destination.

    The -I/--lib option allows specifying additional search paths for
    modules from the source Perl, such as local::lib directories. The
    install behavior for the destination Perl can be influenced using
    standard Perl and cpanm environment variables, such as "PERL_MM_OPT" in
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker, "PERL_MB_OPT" in Module::Build, and
    "PERL_CPANM_OPT" in cpanm.

EXAMPLES

      * Basic migration of modules to a newly installed Perl:

        $ perl-migrate-modules /opt/perl-5.20.3 /opt/perl-5.22.0

      * Migrate modules from an old (inactive) local::lib directory:

        $ perl-migrate-modules --from ~/perl5-old/lib/perl5 /usr/bin/perl

      * Migrate modules to a custom local::lib location:

        $ env PERL_CPANM_OPT='-l /opt/project/local' perl-migrate-modules /opt/perl-5.28.0 /opt/perl-5.28.1

      * Update all modules installed in the current Perl:

        $ perl-migrate-modules $(which perl)

CAVEATS

    Only modules with .packlist will be migrated, this will include any
    module installed by CPAN clients, but generally not modules installed
    by vendor packages or core modules.

    Migrated modules will be installed at their latest indexed version, not
    the version that exists in the source Perl.

    Any environment settings that affect Perl's library search and module
    install locations, such as PERL5LIB or an active local::lib, will be
    ignored for the source Perl but will have its normal effect on
    installation into the destination Perl.
