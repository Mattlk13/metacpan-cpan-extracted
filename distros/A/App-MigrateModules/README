        -v, --version                Show the version of this script

DESCRIPTION

    Reinstalls all modules found in the source Perl into the destination
    Perl, similar to the clone-modules command for perlbrew or the
    migrate-modules command for plenv <https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv>.
    The Perls may be passed as paths to the base installation directory or
    paths to the perl executable itself. If only one path is passed, it
    will be used as both the source and destination, but the search and
    install paths can be influenced.

    Modules are found in the source Perl's standard @INC search paths by
    default. To specify additional search paths, such as local::lib
    directories, use the -I/--lib option. To specify search paths to use
    and omit the standard search paths, use the -f/--from option.

    Modules are installed to the destination Perl using cpanm. To influence
    the install location, activate a local::lib in your environment, or use
    the standard Perl and cpanm environment variables, such as
    "PERL_MM_OPT" in ExtUtils::MakeMaker, "PERL_MB_OPT" in Module::Build,
    and "PERL_CPANM_OPT" in cpanm.

EXAMPLES

      * Basic migration of modules to a newly installed Perl from an
      existing one:

        $ perl-migrate-modules /opt/perl-5.20.3 /opt/perl-5.22.0

      * Migrate modules from an old (inactive) local::lib directory, using
      /usr/bin/perl both to find source modules and to install:

        $ perl-migrate-modules --from ~/perl5-old/lib/perl5 /usr/bin/perl

      * Migrate modules from the sitelib of a Perl that can no longer be
      executed, using the active Perl executable both to find source
      modules and to install:

        $ perl-migrate-modules --from ~/.plenv/versions/5.24.0/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.24.0/ $(which perl)

      * Migrate modules to a custom local::lib location, using
      /opt/perl-5.28.0 to find modules within its search paths and using
      /opt/perl-5.28.1 to install to /opt/project/local:

        $ env PERL_CPANM_OPT='-l /opt/project/local' perl-migrate-modules /opt/perl-5.28.0 /opt/perl-5.28.1

      * Update all modules installed in the active Perl:

        $ perl-migrate-modules --include-core $(which perl)

CAVEATS

    Only modules with .packlist will be migrated, this will include any
    module installed by CPAN clients, but generally not modules installed
    by vendor packages or core modules. Core modules available from CPAN
    can be included via Module::CoreList with the --include-core option.

    Migrated modules will be installed at their latest indexed version, not
    the existing version when found.

    Any environment settings that affect Perl's library search and module
    install locations, such as PERL5LIB or an active local::lib, will be
    ignored while searching for modules with the source Perl but will have
    their normal effect on installation into the destination Perl.
