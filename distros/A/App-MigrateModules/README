NAME

    perl-migrate-modules - Migrate installed CPAN modules from one Perl to
    another

SYNOPSIS

      perl-migrate-modules [OPTIONS] <src-path> <dest-path>
    
        perl-migrate-modules /path/to/perl-5.28.0 /path/to/perl-5.28.1
        perl-migrate-modules -nq /usr/bin/perl ~/bin/perl
    
      Options:
        -h, --help                   Show this message
        -n, --notest                 Skip testing and test dependencies
        -q, --quiet                  Show only installation successes and failures
        -v, --version                Show the version of this script

DESCRIPTION

    Reinstalls all modules found in the source Perl into the destination
    Perl, similar to the clone-modules command for perlbrew or the
    migrate-modules command for plenv <https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv>.
    The Perls may be passed as paths to the base installation directory or
    paths to the perl executable itself.

CAVEATS

    Only modules with .packlist will be migrated, this will include any
    module installed by CPAN clients, but generally not modules installed
    by vendor packages or core modules.

    Migrated modules will be installed at their latest indexed version, not
    the version that exists in the source Perl.

BUGS

    Report any issues on the public bugtracker.
