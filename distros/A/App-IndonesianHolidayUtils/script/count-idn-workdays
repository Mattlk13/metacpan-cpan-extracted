=head1 NAME

count-idn-workdays - Count working days (non-holiday business days) for a certain period

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.064 of count-idn-workdays (from Perl distribution App-IndonesianHolidayUtils), released on 2021-07-24.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

% B<count-idn-workdays> [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--observe-joint-leaves>|B<-j>|B<--no-observe-joint-leaves>|B<--noobserve-joint-leaves>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] [B<--work-saturdays>|B<--no-work-saturdays>|B<--nowork-saturdays>] -- [I<start_date>] [I<end_date>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Working day is defined as day that is not Saturday*/Sunday/holiday/joint leave
days*. If work_saturdays is set to true, Saturdays are also counted as working
days. If observe_joint_leaves is set to false, joint leave days are also counted
as working days.

Contains data from years 1990 to 2021

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--end-date>=I<s>

End date.

Defaults to end of current month. Either a string in the form of "YYYY-MM-DD",
or a DateTime object, is accepted.


Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument.

=item B<--no-observe-joint-leaves>, B<-j>

=item B<--start-date>=I<s>

Starting date.

Defaults to start of current month. Either a string in the form of "YYYY-MM-DD",
or a DateTime object, is accepted.


Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--work-saturdays>

If set to 1, Saturday is a working day.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C count-idn-workdays count-idn-workdays

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then

line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete count-idn-workdays 'p/*/`count-idn-workdays`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells
