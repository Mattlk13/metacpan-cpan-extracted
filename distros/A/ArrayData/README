NAME
    ArrayData - Specification for ArrayData::*, modules that contains array
    data

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.2

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.2.2 of ArrayData (from Perl
    distribution ArrayData), released on 2021-05-07.

SYNOPSIS
    Use one of the "ArrayData::*" modules.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY SPECIFICATION; THINGS WILL STILL CHANGE A LOT.

    "ArrayData::*" modules are modules that contain array data. The array
    can be stored in an actual Perl array in the source code, or as lines in
    the DATA section of the source code, or in other places. The array data
    can be accessed via a standard interface (see
    ArrayDataRole::Spec::Basic). Some examples of array data are:

    *   list of country names in English (ArrayData::CountryName::EN)

    *   list of Indonesian words from KBBI <https://kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id/>
        dictionary (ArrayData::Word::ID::KBBI)

        Also under WordList::ID::KBBI.

    *   list of CPAN authors' PAUSE ID's (ArrayData::CPAN::PAUSEID)

        Also under WordList::CPAN::PAUSEID.

    Why put data in a Perl module, as a Perl distribution? To leverage the
    Perl/CPAN toolchain and infrastructure: 1) ease of installation, update,
    and uninstallation; 2) allowing dependency expression and version
    comparison; 3) ease of packaging further as OS packages, e.g. Debian
    packages (converted from Perl distribution); 4) testing by CPAN Testers.

    To get started, see ArrayDataRole::Spec::Basic and one of existing
    "ArrayData::*" modules.

NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION
    "ArrayData" (this module) is the specification.

    All the modules under "ArrayData::*" should be modules with actual data
    (base classes should be put in "ArrayDataBase::*", roles in
    "ArrayDataRole::*").

    More specific subnamespaces for more specific types of elements:

    *   "ArrayData::String::*"

        Strings. (But please see other more specific names.)

    *   "ArrayData::Word::*"

        Dictionary word lists (further classified as (further classified in
        "ArrayData::Word::"*LanguageCode*"::*" e.g.
        ArrayData::Word::ID::KBBI). These are designed to replace old
        WordList::* modules.

    *   "ArrayData::Phrase::*"

        Phrase lists. Designed to replace old "WordList::Phrase::*" modules.

    *   "ArrayData::CPAN::*"

        Arrays related to CPAN. Designed to replace old
        "WordList::Domain::*" modules.

    *   "ArrayData::Domain::*"

        Domain names or suffixes. Designed to replace old
        "WordList::Domain::*" modules.

    *   "ArrayData::HTTP::*"

        HTTP-related array data. Designed to replace old "WordList::HTTP::*"
        modules.

    *   "ArrayData::Number::*"

        Numbers.

    *   "ArrayData::Password::*"

        Passwords. Designed to replace old "WordList::HTTP::*" modules.

    "ArrayDataBase::*" the base classes. "ArrayDataBases::*" are main module
    names for distributions that bundle multiple base classes.

    "ArrayDataRole::*" the roles. "ArrayDataRoles::*" are main module names
    for distributions that bundle multiple roles.

    "ArrayDataBundle::*" are main module names for distributions that
    contain several "ArrayData" modules.

FAQ
  Should I use WordList or ArrayData (ArrayData::Word)?
    Both are okay. If you prefer WordList then by all means use it. Existing
    WordList::* modules will stay. WordList's API is now frozen. New
    development and updates to word lists will happen mostly in ArrayData
    only.

  What are the differences between ArrayData and WordList?
    Method names:

     Function                       In WordList                                      In ArrayData
     --------                       -----------                                      ------------
     iterating words                each_word()                                      each_item() (from Role::TinyCommons::Iterator::Resettable)
                                    reset_iterator() + first_word() + next_word()    reset_iterator() + has_next_item() + get_next_item() (from Role::TinyCommons::Iterator::Resettable)
     checking if a word exists      word_exists()                                    has_item() (from Role::TinyCommons::Collection::FindItem)
     getting all words              all_words()                                      get_all_items() (from Role::TinyCommons::Iterator::Resettable)
     picking random words           pick()                                           pick_items() (from Role::TinyCommons::Collection::PickItems)

    Additional roles:
