NAME
    ArrayData - Specification for ArrayData::*, modules that contains array
    data

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.1

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.1.0 of ArrayData (from Perl
    distribution ArrayData), released on 2021-04-11.

SYNOPSIS
    Use one of the "ArrayData::*" modules.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY SPECIFICATION; THINGS WILL STILL CHANGE A LOT.

    "ArrayData::*" modules are modules that contain array data. The array
    can be accessed via a standard interface (see
    ArrayDataRole::Spec::Basic). Some examples of array data are:

    *   list of country names in English (ArrayData::CountryNames::EN)

    *   list of Indonesian words from KBBI <https://kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id/>
        dictionary (ArrayData::Words::ID::KBBI)

        Also under WordList::ID::KBBI.

    *   list of CPAN authors' PAUSE ID's (ArrayData::CPAN::PAUSEIDs)

        Also under WordList::CPAN::PAUSEID.

    Why put data in a Perl module, as a Perl distribution? To leverage the
    Perl/CPAN toolchain and infrastructure: 1) ease of installation, update,
    and uninstallation; 2) allowing dependency expression and version
    comparison; 3) ease of packaging further as OS packages, e.g. Debian
    packages (converted from Perl distribution); 4) testing by CPAN Testers.

    The table data can actually be stored as CSV in the DATA section of a
    Perl module, or as a CSV file in a shared directory of a Perl
    distribution, or a Perl structure in the module source code, or from
    other sources.

    To get started, see ArrayDataRole::Spec::Basic and one of existing
    "ArrayData::*" modules.

NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION
