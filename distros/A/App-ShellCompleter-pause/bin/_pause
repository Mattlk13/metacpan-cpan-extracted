=head1 NAME

_pause - Improved shell completer for pause

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of _pause (from Perl distribution App-ShellCompleter-pause), released on 2017-01-13.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To install, install this module and then in your bash (and/or bash startup
file):

 complete -C _pause pause

or, you can use L<shcompgen> to do that for you automatically.

Now L<pause> has improved bash completion:

 % pause <tab>  ;# complete subcommand and options
 % pause upload Some-Release-0.01.tar.gz --retries <tab> ;# complete argument value

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<pause> script from L<App::pause> already comes with basic completion: it
can complete subcommand names and options. This completer can also complete
argument values.
