NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::RandomPerson - Generating random person (name, title,
    age, etc)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::RandomPerson
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-RandomPerson), released on
    2021-05-26.

DESCRIPTION
    Generating

    Data::RandomPerson can generate random name, title, age, gender dob for
    several "types" (language or geographic area): Arabic, Dutch, English,
    ModernGreek, Spanish. There are data for other types included in the
    distribution though: AncientGreek, Basque, Celtic, Hindi, Japanese,
    Latvian, Thai, Viking. At the time of this writing (v0.60), there are
    140 English female first names to choose from, 130 English male first
    names, and 1003 English last names.

    The Mock::Person namespace contains several modules to generate random
    person names. The modules here are not exactly part of a single
    framework so the interface might slightly differ from one another:
    Mock::Person::CZ (Czech), Mock::Person::DE (German), Mock::Person::EN
    (English), Mock::Person::ID (Indonesian), Mock::Person::JP (Japanese),
    Mock::Person::JV (Javanese), Mock::Person::RU (Russian),
    Mock::Person::SK (Slovak), Mock::Person::SK::ROM (Romani),
    Mock::Person::SV (Swedish), Mock::Person::US (American).

    Data::Faker is a plugin-based framework to generate random person name,
    company name, phone number, street address, email, domain name, IP
    address, and so on. The included name plugin only generates English
    names and there is no option to pick male/female. At the time of this
    writing (v0.10), there are 474 last names and 3007 first names. It can
    also add suffixes like II, III, Jr., Sr.

    Faker is another plugin-based random data generator. The included
    plugins can generate random street address, color, company name, company
    jargon/tagline, buzzwords, IP address, email address, domain name, text
    ("lorem ipsum ..."), credit card number, phone number, software name,
    username. However, some plugins are currently empty. The name plugin
    contains 3007 first names and 474 last names (probably copied from
    Data::Faker). There is no option to pick male/female names.

    Keywords: date of birth, mock person, fake data, fake person.
