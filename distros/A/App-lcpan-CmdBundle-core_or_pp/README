VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of
    App::lcpan::CmdBundle::core_or_pp (from Perl distribution
    App-lcpan-CmdBundle-core_or_pp), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
    Install this distribution, then the lcpan subcommands below will be
    available:

     # Check that a module is core/PP (without checking its prereqs)
     % lcpan core-or-pp JSON::MaybeXS

     # Check that a module and its prereqs are all core/PP
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-deps JSON::MaybeXS

     # Check that a module and its recursive prereqs are all core/PP
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-recursive-deps JSON::MaybeXS

     # Check that a module and its prereqs are all core
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-deps --core JSON::MaybeXS

     # Check that a module and its prereqs are all PP
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-deps --pp JSON::MaybeXS

DESCRIPTION
    This bundle provides the following lcpan subcommands:

    *   lcpan core-or-pp

    The subcommand "core-or-pp" checks that a module with its (recursive)
    (runtime requires) prereqs are all core/PP. Doing this check is useful
    when we want to fatpack said module along with its prereqs.
