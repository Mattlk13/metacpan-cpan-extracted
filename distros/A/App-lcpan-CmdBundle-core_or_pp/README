SYNOPSIS

    Install this distribution, then the lcpan subcommands below will be
    available:

     # Check that a module is core/PP (without checking its prereqs)
     % lcpan core-or-pp JSON::MaybeXS
    
     # Check that a module and its prereqs are all core/PP
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-deps JSON::MaybeXS
    
     # Check that a module and its recursive prereqs are all core/PP
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-recursive-deps JSON::MaybeXS
    
     # Check that a module and its prereqs are all core
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-deps --core JSON::MaybeXS
    
     # Check that a module and its prereqs are all PP
     % lcpan core-or-pp --with-deps --pp JSON::MaybeXS

DESCRIPTION

    The subcommand core-or-pp checks that a module with its (recursive)
    (runtime requires) prereqs are all core/PP. Doing this check is useful
    when we want to fatpack said module along with its prereqs.
