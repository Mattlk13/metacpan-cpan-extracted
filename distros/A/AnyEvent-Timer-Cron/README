NAME
    AnyEvent::Timer::Cron - cron based timers for AnyEvent

SYNOPSIS
        use AnyEvent;
        use AnyEvent::Timer::Cron;

        my $w; $w = AnyEvent::Timer::Cron->new(cron => '0 1 * * *', cb => sub {
            undef $w;
            ...
        });
        AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

DESCRIPTION
    This module creates timers based on cron rules.

    This module primarily exists to replace similar that try to do too much
    work, instead providing the simplest implementation, and using
    AnyEvent's standard conventions for timer lifetime.

METHODS
  new( cron => $cron, cb => sub {} )
    Creates a new cron timer. The callback will be called continually
    according to the cron rules until the object is destroyed.

    cron
        Required. A cron rule, either in string form or as a
        DateTime::Event::Cron, DateTime::Event::Cron::Quartz, or
        DateTime::Set object.

    cb  Required. The callback to call for the cron events.

    time_zone
        A cron rule will be calculated under the specified time zone. If not
        specified, events will be calculated using UTC.
