NAME

    Acme::Godot - Nothing to be done

SYNOPSIS

        use Acme::Godot;

DESCRIPTION

    This module will make your program wait for Godot.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Build install

INTERFACE

    Acme::Godot does not have an interface, and need only to be used by
    another program in order to start waiting.

DIAGNOSTICS

    (Program apparently hanging)

      Everything is OK. Your program is successfully waiting for Godot.
      He'll probably be here soon.

    (Program exited unexpectedly)

      Godot may have arrived. Have you checked? If he's not here, start
      your program again.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

    Acme::Godot requires no configuration files or environment variables,
    but the end user of this program is advised to make use of available
    assistive tools and methods in order to make the waiting for Godot more
    pleasant.

DEPENDENCIES

    You might want to warn people dependent on you that you're about to use
    this module.

INCOMPATIBILITIES

    None reported. We're still waiting for Godot to bring the test reports.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    No bugs have been reported. Where's Godot with the bug reports?

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Thanks to mr. Rune Sandnes for the inspiration.
