  * drop port: option from default config
  * add port to the test server IRC config now that 6697 us the default
  * encode/decode Git directory name when passing it to Git or when reading it
    from the environment
    this matters when the directory name is not plain ASCII (Closes: #822375)
  * auto join: increase NickServ delay to 60 seconds (default is 5)
    this helps joining +r channels on freenode, where nick server identification
    takes more than 5 seconds
  * fix path to scripts in t/critic.t
  * reorder default notification order, keeping the order of colours
    the new order is project/module, branch, commit, author, log
  * Client::Git: strip leading whitespace when parsing the output of
    'git status'

  [ Martín Ferrari ]
  * Add merge request title to merge request notifications.
  * Stop using channel as a unique identifier.
    This is a big change, as most of the code was assuming a channel name is
    unique across networks, causing weird issues when adding channels
    dynamically from a webhook.
  * Factor out some repetitive code.
  * The current code was leaving the configuration in a inconsistent state when
    a channel was dynamically added; now it is done as if it was added to the
    configuration.
  * Finally fix the dynamic join problem.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * use get_chanid at one more place instead of hand-crafted concatenation
  * when complaining of a repo without channels, suggest adding them to
    the request parameters

  * fix comparison of Git version to 2.9.0, when the minor version is greater t»

    - close the PID file after reading it
  * kgb-bot:
    - add the PID to the "Listening on ..." line in the log
    - rewrite the PID management code using OO interface of Proc::PID::File.
      This fixes a rather nasty hardly-reproducible bug causing the PID file
      to be re-created after being removed, which may fool the tests and make
      them hang.
      Closes: #782079

    - More consistent verbose reporting of server communication.
    - Add --dry-run option for debugging.
    - Bug fix: use correct method when sending a commit info with
      default protocol.
  * App::KGB::Client: format_message: Don't lose data.
    When the commit object does not have all the info, it still overwrites
    data coming from the extra arguments. It meant SVN commits were lacking
    branch and module information completely.

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Fix t/52-client-git.t to work with newer git versions as well.
    Since 2.9.0, git allows merging branches without a common ancestors only
    when "--allow-unrelated-histories" is passed. This has lead to test
    failures.
    Pass the parameter conditionally.
