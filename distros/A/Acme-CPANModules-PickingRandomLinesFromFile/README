ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    File::Random
        Author: BIGJ <https://metacpan.org/author/BIGJ>

        The "random_line()" function from this module picks one or more
        random lines from a specified file. The whole content of the file
        does not need to be slurped into memory, but the routine requires a
        single-pass of reading all lines from the file. The algorithm is as
        described in perlfaq (See: "perldoc -q "random line"").

        If you pick more than one lines, then there might be duplicates.

    File::RandomLine
        Recommended for large files.

        Author: DAGOLDEN <https://metacpan.org/author/DAGOLDEN>

        This module gives you a choice of two algorithms. The first is
        similar to File::Random (the scan method), giving each line of the
        file equal weight. The second algorithm is more interesting: it
        works by random seeking the file, discarding the line fragment
        (a.k.a. searching forward for the next newline character), reading
        the next line, then repeating the process until the desired number
        of lines is reached. This means one doesn't have to read the whole
        file and the picking process is much faster than the scan method. It
        might be preferred for very large files.

        Note that due to the nature of the algorithm, lines are weighted by
        the number of characters. In other words, lines that have long lines
        immediately preceding them will have a greater probability of being
        picked. Depending on your use case or the line length variation of
        your file, this algorithm might or might not be acceptable to you.

    File::Random::Pick
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        This module is an alternative to File::Random. It offers a
        "random_line()" routine that avoids duplication.

    App::PickRandomLines
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        A CLI that allows you to use File::Random::Pick or File::RandomLine
        on the command-line.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n PickingRandomLinesFromFile

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries PickingRandomLinesFromFile | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=PickingRandomLinesFromFile -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::PickingRandomLinesFromFile -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomLinesFromFile::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
