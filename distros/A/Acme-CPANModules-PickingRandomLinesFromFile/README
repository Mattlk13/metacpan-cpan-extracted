NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomLinesFromFile - Picking random lines
    from a file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomLinesFromFile (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-PickingRandomLinesFromFile), released on 2019-11-27.

DESCRIPTION
    Picking random lines from a file.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   File::Random

        The "random_line()" function from this module picks one or more
        random lines from a specified file. The whole content of the file
        does not need to be slurped into memory, but the routine requires a
        single-pass of reading all lines from the file. The algorithm is as
        described in perlfaq (See: "perldoc -q "random line"").

        If you pick more than one lines, then there might be duplicates.

    *   File::RandomLine - Recommended for large files

        This module gives you a choice of two algorithms. The first is
        similar to File::Random (the scan method), giving each line of the
        file equal weight. The second algorithm is more interesting: it
        works by random seeking the file, discarding the line fragment
        (a.k.a. searching forward for the next newline character), reading
        the next line, then repeating the process until the desired number
        of lines is reached. This means one doesn't have to read the whole
        file and the picking process is much faster than the scan method. It
        might be preferred for very large files.

        Note that due to the nature of the algorithm, lines are weighted by
        the number of characters. In other words, lines that have long lines
        immediately preceding them will have a greater probability of being
        picked. Depending on your use case or the line length variation of
        your file, this algorithm might or might not be acceptable to you.

    *   File::Random::Pick

        This module is an alternative to File::Random. It offers a
        "random_line()" routine that avoids duplication.

    *   App::PickRandomLines

        A CLI that allows you to use File::Random::Pick or File::RandomLine
        on the command-line.
