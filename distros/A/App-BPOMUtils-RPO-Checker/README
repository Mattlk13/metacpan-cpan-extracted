NAME
    App::BPOMUtils::RPO::Checker - Various checker utilities to help with
    Processed Food Registration (RPO - Registrasi Pangan Olahan) at BPOM

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.012 of App::BPOMUtils::RPO::Checker
    (from Perl distribution App-BPOMUtils-RPO-Checker), released on
    2023-03-30.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes CLI utilities related to helping with
    Processed Food Registration (RPO - Registrasi Pangan Olahan).

    *   bpom-rpo-check-files

    *   bpom-rpo-check-files-label-design

FUNCTIONS
  bpom_rpo_check_files
    Usage:

     bpom_rpo_check_files(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check document files.

    By default will check all files in the current directory, recursively.

    Here's what it checks: - filename should not contain unsafe symbols -
    file must not be larger than 5MB - file must be readable - type of file
    must be PDF or image (JPG), other types will generate warnings - file's
    mime type and extension must match

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filenames => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  bpom_rpo_check_files_label_design
    Usage:

     bpom_rpo_check_files_label_design(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check label design files.

    By default will check all files in the current directory, recursively.

    Here's what it checks: - all the checks by bpom_rpo_check_files() - file
    must be in JPEG format and has name ending in /.jpe?g$/i - image size
    must be smaller than 2300 x 2300 px - (WARNING) image should not be
    smaller than 600 x 600px

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filenames => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
