NAME
    App::HTTPTinyUtils - Command-line utilities related to HTTP::Tiny

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of App::HTTPTinyUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-HTTPTinyUtils), released on 2019-04-15.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to HTTP::Tiny:

    *   http-tiny

    *   http-tiny-cache

    *   http-tiny-customretry

    *   http-tiny-plugin

    *   http-tiny-retry

FUNCTIONS
  http_tiny
    Usage:

     http_tiny(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Perform request(s) with HTTP::Tiny.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   attributes => *hash*

        Pass attributes to HTTP::Tiny constructor.

    *   content => *str*

    *   headers => *hash*

    *   ignore_errors => *bool*

        Ignore errors.

        Normally, when given multiple URLs, the utility will exit after the
        first non-success response. With "ignore_errors" set to true, will
        just log the error and continue. Will return with the last error
        response.

    *   method => *str* (default: "GET")

    *   raw => *bool*

    *   urls* => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  http_tiny_cache
    Usage:

     http_tiny_cache(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Perform request with HTTP::Tiny::Cache.

    Like "http_tiny", but uses HTTP::Tiny::Cache instead of HTTP::Tiny. See
    the documentation of HTTP::Tiny::Cache on how to set cache period.

    This function is not exported.
