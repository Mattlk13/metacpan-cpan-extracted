=head1 NAME

ppgrep - Look up parents' processes based on name and other attributes

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.030 of ppgrep (from Perl distribution App-ProcUtils), released on 2018-01-17.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % ppgrep [options] [pattern]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is similar to L<pgrep> except that we only look at our
descendants (parent, parent's parent, and so on up to PID 1).

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Display options

=over

=item B<--count>, B<-c>

Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.

=item B<--list-full>, B<-a>

List the full command line as well as the process ID.

=item B<--list-name>, B<-l>

List the process name as well as the process ID.

=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--euid>=I<s>, B<-u>

Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed. Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used..

=item B<--exact>, B<-x>

Only match processes whose names (or command line if -f is specified) exactly match the pattern.

=item B<--full>, B<-f>

The pattern is normally only matched against the process name.  When -f is set, the full command line is used..

=item B<--group>=I<s>, B<-G>

Only match processes whose real group ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used..

=item B<--inverse>, B<-v>

Negates the matching.

=item B<--pattern>=I<s>

Only match processes whose name/cmdline match the pattern.

=item B<--pgroup>=I<s>, B<-g>

Only match processes in the process group IDs listed.

=item B<--session>=I<s>, B<-s>

Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.

=item B<--terminal>=I<s>, B<-t>

Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed. The terminal name should be specified without the "/dev/" prefix..

=item B<--uid>=I<s>, B<-U>

Only match processes whose user ID is listed. Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used..

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-V>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C ppgrep ppgrep

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete ppgrep 'p/*/`ppgrep`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
