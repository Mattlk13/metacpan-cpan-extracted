NAME
    App::ProcUtils - Command line utilities related to processes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.030 of App::ProcUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-ProcUtils), released on 2018-01-17.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   ppgrep

    *   proc-list-parents

    *   proc-table

FUNCTIONS
  grep_parents
    Usage:

     grep_parents(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Look up parents' processes based on name and other attributes.

    This utility is similar to pgrep except that we only look at our
    descendants (parent, parent's parent, and so on up to PID 1).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   count => *true*

        Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.

    *   euid => *array[str]*

        Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed. Either the
        numerical or symbolical value may be used.

    *   exact => *true*

        Only match processes whose names (or command line if -f is
        specified) exactly match the pattern.

    *   full => *true*

        The pattern is normally only matched against the process name. When
        -f is set, the full command line is used.

    *   group => *array[str]*

        Only match processes whose real group ID is listed. Either the
        numerical or symbolical value may be used.

    *   inverse => *true*

        Negates the matching.

    *   list_full => *true*

        List the full command line as well as the process ID.

    *   list_name => *true*

        List the process name as well as the process ID.

    *   pattern => *str*

        Only match processes whose name/cmdline match the pattern.

    *   pgroup => *array[nonnegint]*

        Only match processes in the process group IDs listed.

    *   session => *array[nonnegint]*

        Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.

    *   terminal => *array[str]*

        Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed. The
        terminal name should be specified without the "/dev/" prefix.

    *   uid => *array[str]*

        Only match processes whose user ID is listed. Either the numerical
        or symbolical value may be used.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  list_parents
    Usage:

     list_parents() -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    List all the parents of the current process.
