FUNCTIONS
  wordlist
    Usage:

     wordlist(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Grep words from (or test them against) WordList::*.

    Examples:

    *   By default print all words from all wordlists:

         wordlist();

    *   Print all words from all static wordlists (dynamic ones are excluded
        with --exclude-dynamic-wordlists a.k.a. -D):

         wordlist(exclude_dynamic_wordlists => 1);

    *   Print all words matching /foo/ and /bar/:

         wordlist(arg => ["foo", "bar"]);

    *   Print all words matching /foo/ or /bar/:

         wordlist(arg => ["foo", "bar"], or => 1);

    *   Print wordlist name for each matching words:

         wordlist(arg => ["foo"], detail => 1);

    *   Select a specific wordlist (multiple -w allowed):

         wordlist(arg => ["foo"], wordlists => ["ID::KBBI"]);

    *   Select all ID::* wordlists (wildcard will be expanded):

         wordlist(arg => ["foo"], wordlists => ["ID::**"]);

    *   Select a bunch of wordlists via wordlist bundle
        (Acme::CPANModules::WordListBundle::* module):

         wordlist(arg => ["foo"], wordlist_bundles => ["Proverbs"]);

    *   An alternative to select all proverb wordlists:

         wordlist(arg => ["foo"], wordlists => ["Phrase::**::Proverb::**"]);

    *   Check to see which wordlists we are selecting via `-w` with
        wildcards or via `-b`:

         wordlist(action => "list_selected", wordlists => ["Phrase::**::Proverb::**"]);

    *   Print all words from EN::Enable wordlist that are 6 characters long
        and have the letters BOBLEG (in no particular order); great for
        cheats in word forming games:

         wordlist(
             chars_unordered => "bobleg",
           ignore_case => 1,
           len => 6,
           wordlists => ["EN::Enable"]
         );

    *   Print all words from EN::Enable wordlist that are 6 characters long
        and have the letters B,G,L (in that order); great for finding
        crossword puzzle answers:

         wordlist(
             chars_ordered => "BGL",
           ignore_case => 1,
           len => 6,
           wordlists => ["EN::Enable"]
         );

    *   Select French wordlists (multiple --lang allowed):

         wordlist(arg => ["foo"], langs => ["FR"]);

    *   Filter by regex:

         wordlist(arg => ["/fof[aeiou]/"]);

    *   Select a wordlist with parameters:

         wordlist(wordlists => ["MetaSyntactic=theme,dangdut"]);

    *   List installed wordlist modules:

         wordlist(action => "list_installed");

    *   List wordlist modules available on CPAN:

         wordlist(action => "list_cpan");

    *   Show statistics of a wordlist module:

         wordlist(action => "stat", wordlists => ["ID::KBBI"]);

    *   Check some passwords against a password wordlist:

         wordlist(
             arg => ["foobar", 123456, "someGoodPass923"],
           action => "test",
           wordlists => ["Password::RockYou::BloomOnly"]
         );

    *   Check some passwords against all Password wordlists except
        Password::RockYou (because it is slow to check):

         wordlist(
             arg => ["foobar", 123456, "someGoodPass923"],
           action => "test",
           exclude_wordlists => ["Password::RockYou"],
           wordlists => ["Password::**"]
         );

    *   Check some passwords against all Password wordlists except those
        matching /RockYou/ regex:

         wordlist(
             arg => ["foobar", 123456, "someGoodPass923"],
           action => "test",
           exclude_wordlist_pattern => "RockYou",
           wordlists => ["Password::**"]
         );

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action => *str* (default: "grep")

        Action "list_installed" (shortcut option "-l") will list WordList::*
        modules installed on the local system.

        Action "list_cpan" (shortcut option "-L") will list available
        WordList::* modules on CPAN, either by querying the MetaCPAN site or
        by querying a local mini CPAN using App::lcpan.

        Action "list_selected" (option "--action=list_selected") will list
        the selected WordList::* modules (e.g. via "-w" or "-b").

        Action "grep" (the default action) will filter the words from each
        selected wordlists and print them.

        Action "stat" (shortcut option "-s") will show statistics about all
        the selected wordlists.

        Action "test" (shortcut option "-t") will check whether words are in
        one of the wordlist, using "word_exists()" method on each wordlist.

    *   arg => *array[str]*

    *   chars_ordered => *str*

        Specify possible characters for the word (ordered).

    *   chars_unordered => *str*

        Specify possible characters for the word (unordered).

    *   color => *str* (default: "auto")

        When to highlight search string/matching pattern with color.

    *   detail => *bool*

        Display more information when listing modules/result.

        When listing installed modules ("-l"), this means also returning a
        wordlist's language.

        When returning grep result, this means also returning wordlist name.

    *   exclude_dynamic_wordlists => *bool*

    *   exclude_wordlist_pattern => *re_from_str*

    *   exclude_wordlists => *array[str]*

        Exclude wordlist modules.

    *   ignore_case => *bool* (default: 1)

    *   langs => *array[str]*

        Only include wordlists of certain language(s).

        By convention, language code is the first subnamespace of a wordlist
        module, e.g. WordList::EN::* for English, WordList::FR::* for
        French, and so on. Wordlist modules which do not follow this
        convention (e.g. WordList::Password::* or WordList::PersonName::*)
        are not included.

    *   lcpan => *bool*

        Use local CPAN mirror first when available (for -L).

    *   len => *int*

    *   max_len => *int*

    *   min_len => *int*

    *   num => *int* (default: 0)

        Return (at most) this number of words (0 = unlimited).

    *   or => *bool*

        Instead of printing words that must match all queries (the default),
        print words that match any query.

    *   random => *bool*

        Pick random words.

        If set to true, then streaming will be turned off. All words will be
        gathered first, then words will be chosen randomly from the gathered
        list.

    *   wordlist_bundles => *array[str]*

        Select one or more wordlist bundle
        (Acme::CPANModules::WordListBundle::*) modules.

    *   wordlists => *array[str]*

        Select one or more wordlist modules.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  wordlist_wordle
    Usage:

     wordlist_wordle(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Help solve Wordle.

    Examples:

    *   One guess:

         wordlist_wordle(arg => ["cR^eEk"]);

    *   Five guesses:

         wordlist_wordle(arg => ["A^R^isE^", "Pound", "might", "blA^ck", "PR^ivY^"]);

    This is a wrapper to wordlist designed to be a convenient helper to
    solve Wordle puzzle. By default it greps from the "EN::Wordle" wordlist.
    It accepts a series of guesses in a format like the following:

     A^R^isE^
     Pound
     might
     blA^ck
     PR^ivY^

    where lowercase means wrong guess, uppercase means correct letter and
    position, while (uppercase) letter followed by a caret ("^") means the
    letter exists in another position. It will convert these guesses to
    regex patterns and the "--chars-unordered" option and pass it to
    "wordlist".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):
