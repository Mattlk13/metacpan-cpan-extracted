=head1 NAME

reencode-video - Re-encode video (using ffmpeg and H.264 codec)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.003 of reencode-video (from Perl distribution App-FfmpegUtils), released on 2020-06-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % reencode-video [--config-path=path | -c] [--config-profile=profile | -P]
     [--crf=s] [--debug] [--dont-downsize] [--downsize-to=s] [--dry-run]
     [--ffmpeg-path=s] [--file=s+] [--files-json=s] [--format=name]
     [--json] [--log-level=level] [--(no)naked-res] [--no-config | -C]
     [--no-downsize] [--no-env] [--page-result[=program]] [--quiet]
     [--trace] [--verbose] [--view-result[=program]] <file> ...

Examples:

The default setting is to downsize to 1080p:

 % reencode-video *

Do not downsize:

 % reencode-video --dont-downsize *

Downsize to 480p but make it "visually lossless":

 % reencode-video --downsize-to 480p --crf 18 *

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility runs ffmpeg to re-encode your video files. It is a wrapper to
simplify invocation of ffmpeg. It selects the appropriate ffmpeg options for
you, allows you to specify multiple files, and picks appropriate output
filenames. It also sports a C<--dry-run> option to let you see ffmpeg options to
be used without actually running ffmpeg.

This utility is usually used to reduce the file size (and optionally video
width/height) of videos so they are smaller, while minimizing quality loss. The
default setting is roughly similar to how Google Photos encodes videos (max
1080p).

The default settings are:

 -v:c libx264
 -preset veryslow (to get the best compression rate, but with the slowest encoding time)
 -crf 28 (0-51, subjectively sane is 18-28, 18 ~ visually lossless, 28 ~ visually acceptable)

when a downsizing is requested (using the C<--downsize-to> option), this utility
first checks each input video if it is indeed larger than the requested final
size. If it is, then the C<-vf scale> option is added. This utility also
calculates a valid size for ffmpeg, since using C<-vf scale=-1:720> sometimes
results in failure due to odd number.

Audio streams are copied, not re-encoded.

Output filenames are:

 ORIGINAL_NAME.crf28.mp4

or (if downsizing is done):

 ORIGINAL_NAME.480p-crf28.mp4

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--crf>=I<s>

=item B<--dont-downsize>

Alias for --downsize-to ''.

See C<--downsize-to>.

=item B<--downsize-to>=I<s>

Default value:

 "1080p"

Valid values:

 ["","480p","720p","1080p"]

Downsizing will only be done if the input video is indeed larger then the target
downsize.

To disable downsizing, set `--downsize-to` to '' (empty string), or specify on
`--dont-downsize` on the CLI.


=item B<--ffmpeg-path>=I<s>

=item B<--file>=I<s@>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--files-json>=I<s>

See C<--file>.

=item B<--no-downsize>

Alias for --downsize-to ''.

See C<--downsize-to>.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--dry-run>

Run in simulation mode (also via DRY_RUN=1).

Default value:

 ""

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C reencode-video reencode-video

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete reencode-video 'p/*/`reencode-video`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/reencode-video.conf>, F<~/reencode-video.conf>, or F</etc/reencode-video.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

List of available configuration parameters:

 crf (see --crf)
 downsize_to (see --downsize-to)
 ffmpeg_path (see --ffmpeg-path)
 files (see --file)
