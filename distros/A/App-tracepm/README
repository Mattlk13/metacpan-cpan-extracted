NAME
    App::tracepm - Trace dependencies of your Perl script

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.230 of App::tracepm (from Perl
    distribution App-tracepm), released on 2020-04-08.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides command-line utility called tracepm.

FUNCTIONS
  tracepm
    Usage:

     tracepm(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Trace dependencies of your Perl script.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   args => *array[str]*

        Script arguments.

    *   cache_prereqscanner => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether cache Perl::PrereqScanner{,::Lite} result.

    *   core => *bool*

        Filter only modules that are in core.

    *   detail => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to return records instead of just module names.

    *   eval => *str*

        Specify script from command-line instead.

    *   method => *str* (default: "fatpacker")

        Tracing method to use.

        There are several tracing methods that can be used:

        *   "fatpacker" (the default): This method uses the same method that
            "fatpacker trace" uses, which is running the script using "perl
            -c" then collect the populated %INC. Only modules loaded during
            compile time are detected.

        *   "require": This method runs your script normally until it exits.
            At the start of program, it replaces "CORE::GLOBAL::require()"
            with a routine that logs the require() argument to the log file.
            Modules loaded during runtime is also logged by this method. But
            some modules might not work, specifically modules that also
            overrides require() (there should be only a handful of modules
            that do this though).

        *   "prereqscanner": This method does not run your Perl program, but
            statically analyze it using "Perl::PrereqScanner". Since it uses
            "PPI", it can be rather slow.

        *   "prereqscanner_recurse": Like "prereqscanner", but will recurse
            into all non-core modules until they are exhausted. Modules that
            are not found will be skipped. It is recommended to use the
            various "recurse_exclude_*" options options to limit recursion.

        *   "prereqscanner_lite": This method is like the "prereqscanner"
            method, but instead of "Perl::PrereqScanner" it uses
            "Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite". The latter does not use "PPI" but
            use "Compiler::Lexer" which is significantly faster.

        *   "prereqscanner_lite_recurse": Like "prereqscanner_lite", but
            recurses.

    *   module => *perl::modname*

        --module MOD is equivalent to --script 'use MOD'.

    *   multiple_runs => *array[hash]*

        Parameter to run script multiple times.

        A more general alternative to using "args". Script will be run
        multiple times, each with setting from element of this option.

        Can be used to reach multiple run pathways and trace more modules.

        Example:

         [{"args":["-h"]}, # help mode
          {"args":[""], "env":{"COMP_LINE":"cmd x", "COMP_POINT":5}},
         ],

    *   perl_version => *str*

        Perl version, defaults to current running version.

        This is for determining which module is core (the list differs from
        version to version. See Module::CoreList for more details.

    *   recurse_exclude => *array[str]*

        When recursing, exclude some modules.

    *   recurse_exclude_core => *bool*

        When recursing, exclude core modules.

    *   recurse_exclude_pattern => *array[str]*

        When recursing, exclude some module patterns.

    *   recurse_exclude_xs => *bool*

        When recursing, exclude XS modules.

    *   script => *filename*

        Path to script file.

    *   trap_script_output => *bool*

        Trap script output so it does not interfere with trace result.

    *   use => *array[str]*

        Additional modules to "use".

        This is like running:

         perl -MModule1 -MModule2 script.pl

    *   xs => *bool*

        Filter only modules that are XS modules.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
