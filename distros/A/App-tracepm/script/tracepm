=head1 NAME

tracepm - Trace dependencies of your Perl script

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.22 of tracepm (from Perl distribution App-tracepm), released on 2017-07-29.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % tracepm [options] [script] [args] ...

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--args-json>=I<s>

Script arguments (JSON-encoded).

See C<--args>.

=item B<--args>=I<s@>

Script arguments.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--cache-prereqscanner>

Whether cache Perl::PrereqScanner{,::Lite} result.

=item B<--method>=I<s>

Tracing method to use.

Default value:

 "fatpacker"

Valid values:

 ["fatpacker","require","prereqscanner","prereqscanner_lite","prereqscanner_recurse","prereqscanner_lite_recurse"]

There are several tracing methods that can be used:

* `fatpacker` (the default): This method uses the same method that `fatpacker
  trace` uses, which is running the script using `perl -c` then collect the
  populated `%INC`. Only modules loaded during compile time are detected.

* `require`: This method runs your script normally until it exits. At the start
  of program, it replaces `CORE::GLOBAL::require()` with a routine that logs the
  require() argument to the log file. Modules loaded during runtime is also
  logged by this method. But some modules might not work, specifically modules
  that also overrides require() (there should be only a handful of modules that
  do this though).

* `prereqscanner`: This method does not run your Perl program, but statically
  analyze it using `Perl::PrereqScanner`. Since it uses `PPI`, it can be rather
  slow.

* `prereqscanner_recurse`: Like `prereqscanner`, but will recurse into all
  non-core modules until they are exhausted. Modules that are not found will be
  skipped. It is recommended to use the various `recurse_exclude_*` options
  options to limit recursion.

* `prereqscanner_lite`: This method is like the `prereqscanner` method, but
  instead of `Perl::PrereqScanner` it uses `Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite`. The
  latter does not use `PPI` but use `Compiler::Lexer` which is significantly
  faster.

* `prereqscanner_lite_recurse`: Like `prereqscanner_lite`, but recurses.


=item B<--multiple-runs-json>=I<s>

Parameter to run script multiple times (JSON-encoded).

See C<--multiple-runs>.

=item B<--multiple-runs>=I<s>

Parameter to run script multiple times.

A more general alternative to using `args`. Script will be run multiple times,
each with setting from element of this option.

Can be used to reach multiple run pathways and trace more modules.

Example:

    [{"args":["-h"]}, # help mode
     {"args":[""], "env":{"COMP_LINE":"cmd x", "COMP_POINT":5}},
    ],


=item B<--perl-version>=I<s>, B<-V>

Perl version, defaults to current running version.

This is for determining which module is core (the list differs from version to
version. See Module::CoreList for more details.


=item B<--recurse-exclude-core>

When recursing, exclude core modules.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-json>=I<s>

When recursing, exclude some modules (JSON-encoded).

See C<--recurse-exclude>.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-pattern-json>=I<s>

When recursing, exclude some module patterns (JSON-encoded).

See C<--recurse-exclude-pattern>.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-pattern>=I<s@>

When recursing, exclude some module patterns.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-xs>

When recursing, exclude XS modules.

=item B<--recurse-exclude>=I<s@>

When recursing, exclude some modules.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--trap-script-output>

Trap script output so it does not interfere with trace result.

=item B<--use-json>=I<s>

Additional modules to "use" (JSON-encoded).

See C<--use>.

=item B<--use>=I<s@>

Additional modules to "use".

This is like running:

    perl -MModule1 -MModule2 script.pl


Can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Field selection options

=over

=item B<--detail>, B<-l>

Whether to return records instead of just module names.

=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--core>

Filter only modules that are in core.

=item B<--xs>

Filter only modules that are XS modules.

=back

=head2 Input options

=over

=item B<--eval>=I<s>, B<-e>

Specify script from command-line instead.

=item B<--module>=I<s>, B<-m>

--module MOD is equivalent to --script 'use MOD'.

=item B<--script>=I<s>, B<-s>

Path to script file.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C tracepm tracepm

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete tracepm 'p/*/`tracepm`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/tracepm.conf>, F<~/tracepm.conf>, or F</etc/tracepm.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
