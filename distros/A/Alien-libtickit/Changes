        [CHANGES]
         * Updates to latest inc/Alien/make/Module/Build.pm
            + Don't bother with -Wl,-rpath hackery because
              Module::Build::Using::PkgConfig should handle it instead
            + Defer mangling of paths in .pc file until ACTION_install time,
              thus allowing never-installed `cpan> test` dependency trees
              to work

        [CHANGES]
         * Updates to latest inc/Alien/make/Module/Build.pm
