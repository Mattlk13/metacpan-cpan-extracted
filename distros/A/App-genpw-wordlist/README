NAME
    App::genpw::wordlist - Generate password with words from WordList::*

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::genpw::wordlist (from Perl
    distribution App-genpw-wordlist), released on 2018-01-09.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script genpw-wordlist.

FUNCTIONS
  genpw
    Usage:

     genpw(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Generate password with words from WordList::*.

    Using password from dictionary words (in this case, from WordList::*)
    can be useful for humans when remembering the password. Note that using
    a string of random characters is generally better because of the larger
    space (combination). Using a password of two random words from a
    5000-word wordlist has a space of only ~25 million while an 8-character
    of random uppercase letters/lowercase letters/numbers has a space of
    62^8 = ~218 trillion. To increase the space you'll need to use more
    words (e.g. 3 to 5 instead of just 2). This is important if you are
    using the password for something that can be bruteforced quickly e.g.
    for protecting on-disk ZIP/GnuPG file and the attacker has access to
    your file. It is then recommended to use a high number of rounds for
    hashing to slow down password cracking (e.g. "--s2k-count 65011712" in
    GnuPG).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   case => *str* (default: "default")

        Force casing.

        "default" means to not change case. "random" changes casing some
        letters randomly to lower-/uppercase. "lower" forces lower case.
        "upper" forces UPPER CASE. "title" forces Title case.

    *   num => *int* (default: 1)

    *   patterns => *array[str]*

        Pattern(s) to use.

        A pattern is string that is similar to a printf pattern. %P (where P
        is certain letter signifying a format) will be replaced with some
        other string. %Nw (where N is a number) will be replaced by a word
        of length N, %N$MP (where N and M is a number) will be replaced by a
        word of length between N and M. Anything else will be used as-is.
        Available conversions:

         %l   Random Latin letter (A-Z, a-z)
         %d   Random digit (0-9)
         %a   Random letter/digit (Alphanum) (A-Z, a-z, 0-9; combination of %l and %d)
         %s   Random ASCII symbol, e.g. "-" (dash), "_" (underscore), etc.
         %x   Random letter/digit/ASCII symbol (combination of %a and %s)
         %%   A literal percent sign
         %w   Random word

    *   wordlists => *array[str]*

        Select one or more wordlist modules.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
