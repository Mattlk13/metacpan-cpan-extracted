NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CLI::Wrapper::UnixCommand - Various CLIs that wrap
    (popular) Unix commands

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::CLI::Wrapper::UnixCommand (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-CLI-Wrapper-UnixCommand), released on 2018-09-30.

DESCRIPTION
    Various CLIs that wrap (popular) Unix commands.

    These CLI's usually are meant to be called as the Unix commands they
    wrap, e.g.:

     alias ssh=sshwrap-hostcolor

    But they perform additional stuff.

    If you know of others, please drop me a message.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   App::sshwrap::hostcolor - Wraps ssh to remember the background
        terminal color of each user+host you went to

    *   App::manwrap::pm - Wraps man to search for (and tab-complete) Perl
        module documentation

    *   App::gitwrap - Wraps git to do additional stuff, e.g. set user+email
        automatically

    *   App::rsynccolor - Wraps rsync to add color to output, particularly
        highlighting deletion

    *   App::rsync::new2old - Wraps rsync to check that source is newer than
        target

    *   App::lcpan - Wraps cpanm to use local CPAN mirror and let you
        specify script name to install instead of module name

    *   App::diffwc - Wraps (or filters output of) diff to add colors and
        highlight words
