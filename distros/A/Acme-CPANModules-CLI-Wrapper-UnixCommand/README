NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CLI::Wrapper::UnixCommand - Various CLIs that wrap
    (popular) Unix commands

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::CLI::Wrapper::UnixCommand (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-CLI-Wrapper-UnixCommand), released on 2020-08-22.

DESCRIPTION
    These CLI's usually are meant to be called as the Unix commands they
    wrap, e.g.:

     alias ssh=sshwrap-hostcolor

    But they perform additional stuff.

    If you know of others, please drop me a message.
