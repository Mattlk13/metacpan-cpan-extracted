NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Parse::UnixShellCommandLine - Modules that parse
    command-line like Unix shells

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::Parse::UnixShellCommandLine (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-Parse-UnixShellCommandLine), released on 2021-10-01.

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes you need to parse a Unix shell command-line string, e.g. when
    you want to break it into "words".

    In general I recommend Text::ParseWords as it is a core module. If you
    want a little more speed, try Parse::CommandLine::Regexp (see reference
    to benchmark in See Also).

ACME::MODULES ENTRIES
    *   Complete::Bash

        Its "parse_cmdline()" function can break a command-line string into
        words. This function is geared for tab completion, so by default it
        also breaks on some other word-breaking characters like "=", "@",
        and so on. Probably not what you want generally, unless you are
        working with tab completion.

    *   Complete::Zsh

    *   Complete::Fish

    *   Complete::Tcsh

    *   Text::ParseWords

        This core module can split string into words with customizable
        quoting character and support for escaping using backslash. Its
        "shellwords()" function is suitable for breaking command-line string
        into words.

    *   Parse::CommandLine

    *   Parse::CommandLine::Regexp

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Parse::UnixShellCommandLine

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Parse::UnixShellCommandLine | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=Parse::UnixShellCommandLine -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Parse::UnixShellCommandLine -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Parse::UnixShellCommandLine::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
