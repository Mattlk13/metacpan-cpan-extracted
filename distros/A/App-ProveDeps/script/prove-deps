=head1 NAME

prove-deps - Prove all distributions depending on specified module(s)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of prove-deps (from Perl distribution App-ProveDeps), released on 2017-08-14.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % prove-deps [options] <module> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To use this utility, first create C<~/.config/prove-deps.conf>:

 dist_dirs = ~/repos
 dist_dirs = ~/repos-other

The above tells I<prove-deps> where to look for Perl distributions. Then:

 % prove-deps Log::ger

This will search local CPAN mirror for all distributions that depend on
L<Log::ger> then search the distributions in the distribution directories,
C<cd> to each and run C<prove> in it.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--dist-dir>=I<s@>*

Where to find the distributions.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--dist-dirs-json>=I<s>

Where to find the distributions (JSON-encoded).

See C<--dist-dir>.

=item B<--module>=I<s@>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--modules-json>=I<s>

See C<--module>.

=item B<--prove-opt>=I<s@>

Default value:

 ["-l"]

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--prove-opts-json>=I<s>

See C<--prove-opt>.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--exclude-dist-pattern>=I<s>

=item B<--exclude-dists-json>=I<s>

=item B<--include-dist-pattern>=I<s>

=item B<--include-dists-json>=I<s>

See C<--rel>.

=item B<--phase>=I<s@>

Only select dists that depend in these phases.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--phases-json>=I<s>

Only select dists that depend in these phases (JSON-encoded).

See C<--phase>.

=item B<--rel>=I<s@>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--rels-json>=I<s>

Only select dists that depend using these relationships (JSON-encoded).

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--dry-run>, B<-n>

Run in simulation mode (also via DRY_RUN=1).

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C prove-deps prove-deps

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete prove-deps 'p/*/`prove-deps`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/prove-deps.conf>, F<~/prove-deps.conf>, or F</etc/prove-deps.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
