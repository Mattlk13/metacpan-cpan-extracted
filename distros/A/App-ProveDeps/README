NAME
    App::ProveDeps - Prove all distributions depending on specified
    module(s)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::ProveDeps (from Perl
    distribution App-ProveDeps), released on 2017-08-14.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script prove-deps.

FUNCTIONS
  prove_deps
    Usage:

     prove_deps(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Prove all distributions depending on specified module(s).

    To use this utility, first create "~/.config/prove-deps.conf":

     dist_dirs = ~/repos
     dist_dirs = ~/repos-other

    The above tells *prove-deps* where to look for Perl distributions. Then:

     % prove-deps Log::ger

    This will search local CPAN mirror for all distributions that depend on
    Log::ger then search the distributions in the distribution directories,
    "cd" to each and run "prove" in it.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dist_dirs* => *array[dirname]*

        Where to find the distributions.

    *   exclude_dist_pattern => *re*

    *   exclude_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   include_dist_pattern => *re*

    *   include_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

    *   modules* => *array[perl::modname]*

    *   phases => *array[str]*

        Only select dists that depend in these phases.

    *   prove_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-l"])

    *   rels => *array[str]*

        Only select dists that depend using these relationships.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

TODO
    Download distributions.
