NAME
    App::ProveDeps - Prove all distributions depending on specified
    module(s)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::ProveDeps (from Perl
    distribution App-ProveDeps), released on 2020-01-29.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script prove-deps.

FUNCTIONS
  prove_deps
    Usage:

     prove_deps(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Prove all distributions depending on specified module(s).

    To use this utility, first create "~/.config/prove-deps.conf":

     dist_dirs = ~/repos
     dist_dirs = ~/repos-other

    The above tells *prove-deps* where to look for Perl distributions. Then:

     % prove-deps Log::ger

    This will search local CPAN mirror for all distributions that depend on
    Log::ger then search the distributions in the distribution directories,
    "cd" to each and run "prove" in it.

    How distribution directory is searched: first, the exact name
    ("My-Perl-Dist") is searched. If not found, then the name with different
    case (e.g. "my-perl-dist") is searched. If not found, a suffix match
    (e.g. "p5-My-Perl-Dist" or "cpan-My-Perl-Dist") is searched. If not
    found, a prefix match (e.g. "My-Perl-Dist-perl") is searched.

    If not found, when "--download" option is set to true, "prove-deps" will
    try to download the distribution tarball from local CPAN mirror and
    extract it to a temporary directory.

    When a dependent distribution cannot be found or downloaded/extracted,
    this counts as a 412 error (Precondition Failed).

    When a distribution's test fails, this counts as a 500 error (Error).
    Otherwise, the status is 200 (OK).

    "prove-deps" will return status 200 (OK) with the status of each dist.
    It will exit 0 if all distros are successful, otherwise it will exit 1.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dist_dirs* => *array[dirname]*

        Where to find the distributions.

    *   download => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to try download/extract distribution from local CPAN mirror
        (when not found in dist_dirs).

    *   exclude_dist_pattern => *re*

        Distribution name pattern to skip.

    *   exclude_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

        Distributions to skip.

    *   include_dist_pattern => *re*

        If specified, only include distributions with this pattern.

    *   include_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

        If specified, only include these distributions.

    *   modules* => *array[perl::modname]*

        Module names to find dependents of.

    *   phases => *array[str]*

        Only select dists that depend in these phases.

    *   prove_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-l"])

        Options to pass to the prove command.

    *   rels => *array[str]*

        Only select dists that depend using these relationships.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
