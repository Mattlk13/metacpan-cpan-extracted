NAME
    App::perlmv::scriptlet::add_prefix_datestamp - Add datestamp prefix
    (YYYYMMDD-) to filenames, using files' modification time as date

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    App::perlmv::scriptlet::add_prefix_datestamp (from Perl distribution
    App-perlmv-scriptlet-add_prefix_datestamp), released on 2023-08-25.

SYNOPSIS
    With filenames:

     foo.txt
     new-bar.txt

    This command:

     % perlmv add-prefix -a prefix=new- *

    will rename the files as follow:

     foo.txt -> new-foo.txt
     new-bar.txt -> new-new-bar.txt

    This command:

     % perlmv add-prefix -a prefix=new- -a avoid_duplicate_prefix=1 *

    will rename the files as follow:

     foo.txt -> new-foo.txt

DESCRIPTION
    Adding a datestamp prefix on filenames is one of the ways I often use to
    organize documents. There is file modification time supplied by the
    filesystem, but this information does not survive through git repository
    or sharing across the web/mobile application. Hence putting the
    information in the filename.

SCRIPTLET ARGUMENTS
    Arguments can be passed using the "-a" ("--arg") perlmv option, e.g. "-a
    name=val".

  avoid_duplicate_prefix
    Avoid adding prefix when filename already has prefix that looks like
    datestamp (1xxxxxxx- to 2xxxxxxx).

  date
    Use this date instead of file's modification time.

  prefix_format
    Specify datestamp format, in the form of strftime() template.

    The default format is "%Y%m%d-" or "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S-" if you enable the
    "with_time" option. But you can customize it here.

  prefix_regex
    Specify how existing datestamp prefix should be recognized.

    This regex is used to check for the existence of datestamp (if you use
    the "avoid_duplicate_prefix" option. The default is
    "qr/^\d{8}(?:T\d{6})?-/" but if your existing datestamps are in
    different syntax you can accommodate them here.

  with_time
    Whether to add time (YYYYMMDD"T"hhmmss instead of just date (YYYYMMDD).

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
