  Features

   - Add support for using `pdftotext_path`, `pkg_config_path` when
     `ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE=system`. See
     <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/pull/6>.

  Bug fixes
   - Patch Poppler v0.61 to use the full path for the pkg-config .pc files.
     See <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/issues/9>,
     <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/pull/10>.

  Build changes
   - Switch build commands to CMake. This is needed since poppler-0.60.0 which
     removed the autotools build system.

     See <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/issues/4>,
     <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/pull/5>.

   - Explicitly disable poppler-glib on macOS. This may be temporary until a
     fix for finding `-lintl` is found.

   - Enable Xpdf headers for CMake build so that they are available for other
     code that uses them.

     See <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/issues/7>,
     <https://github.com/project-renard/p5-Alien-Poppler/pull/8>.
