SYNOPSIS

    From Perl:

     use Alien::cmake3;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::cmake->bin_dir;
     system 'cmake', ...;

    From alienfile

     use alienfile;
     
     share {
       requires Alien::cmake3;
       build [
         '%{cmake3} ...'
         '%{make}',
         '%{make} install',
       ],
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This Alien distribution provides an external dependency on the build
    tool cmake version 3.0.0 or better. cmake is a popular alternative to
    autoconf.

METHODS

 bin_dir

     my @dirs = Alien::cmake3->bin_dir;

    List of directories that need to be added to the PATH in order for
    cmake to work.

 exe

     my $exe = Alien::cmake3->exe;

    The name of the cmake executable.

HELPERS

 cmake3

     %{cmake3}

    The name of the <cmake> executable.

SEE ALSO

    Alien::CMake

      This is an older distribution that provides an alienized cmake. It is
      different in these ways:

      Alien::cmake3 is based on alienfile and Alien::Build and integrates
      better with Aliens that are based on that technology.

      Alien::cmake3 will provide version 3.0.0 or better. Alien::CMake will
      provide 2.x.x on some platforms where more recent binaries are not
      available.

      Alien::cmake3 will install on platforms where there is no system
      cmake and no binary cmake provided by cmake.org. It does this by
      building cmake from source.

      Alien::cmake3 is preferred in the opinion of the maintainer of both
      Alien::cmake3 and Alien::CMake for these reasons.
