=head1 NAME

parse-nop-pbb - Validate (and parse) Indonesian property tax number (NOP PBB)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.032 of parse-nop-pbb (from Perl distribution App-IndonesianNumberUtils), released on 2023-10-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<parse-nop-pbb> B<L<--help|/"--help, -h, -?">> (or B<L<-h|/"--help, -h, -?">>, B<L<-?|/"--help, -h, -?">>)

B<parse-nop-pbb> B<L<--version|/"--version, -v">> (or B<L<-v|/"--version, -v">>)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indonesian property tax object number, or Nomor Objek Pajak Pajak Bumi dan
Bangunan, is a number given to a tax object (a piece of land with its
house/building).

NOP PBB is composed of 18 digits as follow:

 AA.BB.CCC.DDD.EEE-XXXX.Y

AA is the province code from BPS. BB is locality (city/regency a.k.a
kota/kabupaten) code from BPS. CCC is district (kecamatan) code from BPS. DDD is
village (desa/kelurahan) code from BPS. EEE is block code. XXXX is the object
number. Y is a special code (it is most likely not a check digit, since it is
almost always has the value of 0).

The function will return status 200 if syntax is valid and return the parsed
information hash. Otherwise it will return 400.

Currently the length and AA code is checked against valid province code. There
is currently no way to check whether a specific NOP PBB actually exists, because
you would need to query Dirjen Pajak's database for that.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--str>=I<s>

The input string containing number to check.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

By default, these log levels are available (in order of increasing level of
importance, from least important to most): C<trace>, C<debug>, C<info>,
C<warn>/C<warning>, C<error>, C<fatal>. By default, the level is usually set to
C<warn>, which means that log statements with level C<info> and less important
levels will not be shown. To increase verbosity, choose C<info>, C<debug>, or
C<trace>.

For more details on log level and logging, as well as how new logging levels can
be defined or existing ones modified, see L<Log::ger>.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C parse-nop-pbb parse-nop-pbb

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete parse-nop-pbb 'p/*/`parse-nop-pbb`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
