=head1 NAME

parse-nop-pbb - Validate (and parse) Indonesian property tax number (NOP PBB)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.031 of parse-nop-pbb (from Perl distribution App-IndonesianNumberUtils), released on 2019-11-21.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % parse-nop-pbb [options] [str]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indonesian property tax object number, or Nomor Objek Pajak Pajak Bumi dan
Bangunan, is a number given to a tax object (a piece of land with its
house/building).

NOP PBB is composed of 18 digits as follow:

 AA.BB.CCC.DDD.EEE-XXXX.Y

AA is the province code from BPS. BB is locality (city/regency a.k.a
kota/kabupaten) code from BPS. CCC is district (kecamatan) code from BPS. DDD is
village (desa/kelurahan) code from BPS. EEE is block code. XXXX is the object
number. Y is a special code (it is most likely not a check digit, since it is
almost always has the value of 0).

The function will return status 200 if syntax is valid and return the parsed
information hash. Otherwise it will return 400.

Currently the length and AA code is checked against valid province code. There
is currently no way to check whether a specific NOP PBB actually exists, because
you would need to query Dirjen Pajak's database for that.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--str>=I<s>

The input string containing number to check.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C parse-nop-pbb parse-nop-pbb

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete parse-nop-pbb 'p/*/`parse-nop-pbb`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
