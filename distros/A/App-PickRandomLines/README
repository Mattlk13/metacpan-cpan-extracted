NAME
    App::PickRandomLines - Pick one or more random lines from input

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.020 of App::PickRandomLines (from Perl
    distribution App-PickRandomLines), released on 2020-04-29.

SYNOPSIS
    See pick-random-lines.

FUNCTIONS
  pick_random_lines
    Usage:

     pick_random_lines(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Pick one or more random lines from input.

    TODO: * option to allow or disallow duplicates

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str* (default: "scan")

        "scan" is the algorithm described in the "perlfaq" manual (`perldoc
        -q "random line"). This algorithm scans the whole input once and
        picks one or more lines randomly from it.

        "seek" is the algorithm employed by the Perl module
        "File::RandomLine". It works by seeking a file randomly and finding
        the next line (repeated "n" number of times). This algorithm is
        faster when the input is very large as it avoids having to scan the
        whole input. But it requires that the input is seekable (a single
        file, stdin is not supported and currently multiple files are not
        supported as well). *Might produce duplicate lines*.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

        If none is specified, will get input from stdin.

    *   num_lines => *int* (default: 1)

        If input contains less lines than the requested number of lines,
        then will only return as many lines as the input contains.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
