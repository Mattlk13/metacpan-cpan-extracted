SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to Firefox
    multi-account containers addon:

    *   firefox-container

    *   firefox-mua-list-containers

    *   firefox-mua-modify-containers

    *   firefox-mua-sort-containers

    About the add-on:
    <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers
    />.

FUNCTIONS
  firefox_container
    Usage:

     firefox_container(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    CLI to open URL in a new Firefox tab, in a specific multi-account
    container.

    Examples:

    *   Open two URLs in a container called "mycontainer":

         firefox_container(
             container => "mycontainer",
           urls => ["www.example.com", "www.example.com/url2"]
         );

    *   If URL is not specified, will open a blank tab:

         firefox_container( container => "mycontainer");

    This utility opens a new firefox tab in a specific multi-account
    container. This requires the Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on, as
    well as another add-on called "Open external links in a container",
    <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/>.

    The way it works, because add-ons currently do not have hooks to the
    CLI, is via a custom protocol handler. For example, if you want to open
    <http://www.example.com/> in a container called "mycontainer", you ask
    Firefox to open this URL:

     ext+container:name=mycontainer&url=http://www.example.com/

    Ref: <https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues/365>

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   container* => *str*

    *   profile => *firefox::local_profile_name*

    *   urls => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  firefox_mua_list_containers
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_list_containers(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on's containers.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   profile* => *firefox::local_profile_name*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  firefox_mua_modify_containers
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_modify_containers(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Modify (and delete) Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on's containers
    with Perl code.

    Examples:

    *   Delete all containers matching some conditions (remove -n to
        actually delete it):

         firefox_mua_modify_containers(
             profile => "myprofile",
           code => "return 0 if \$_->{icon} eq \"cart\" || \$_->{name} =~ /temp/i; \$_"
         );

    *   Delete all containers (remove -n to actually delete it):

         firefox_mua_modify_containers( profile => "myprofile", code => 0);

    *   Change all icons to "dollar" and all colors to "red":

         firefox_mua_modify_containers(
             profile => "myprofile",
           code => "\$_->{icon} = \"dollar\"; \$_->{color} = \"red\"; \$_"
         );

    This utility lets you modify the identity records in "containers.json"
    file using Perl code. The Perl code is called for every container
    (record). It is given the record hash in $_ and is supposed to modify
    and return the modified the record. It can also choose to return false
    to instruct deleting the record.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   code* => *code|str*

    *   profile* => *firefox::local_profile_name*

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  firefox_mua_sort_containers
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_sort_containers(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Sort Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on's containers.

    Containers add-on does not provide a way to sort the containers. Thus
    this utility.
