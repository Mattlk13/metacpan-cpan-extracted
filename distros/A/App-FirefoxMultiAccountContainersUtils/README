    />.

FUNCTIONS
  firefox_mua_add_container
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_add_container(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Add a new Firefox Multi-Account container.

    This utility will copy the last container record, change the name to the
    one you specify, and add it to the list of containers. You can also set
    some other attributes.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   color => *str*

        (No description)

    *   icon => *str*

        (No description)

    *   name => *str*

        Name for the new container.

    *   profile => *firefox::local_profile_name::default_first*

        (No description)

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  firefox_mua_dump_identities_json
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_dump_identities_json(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Dump the content of identities.json.

  firefox_mua_modify_containers
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_modify_containers(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Modify (and delete) Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on's containers
    with Perl code.

    Examples:

    *   Delete all containers matching some conditions (remove -n to
        actually delete it):

         firefox_mua_modify_containers(
             profile => "myprofile",
           code => "return 0 if \$_->{icon} eq \"cart\" || \$_->{name} =~ /temp/i; \$_"
         );

    *   Delete all containers (remove -n to actually delete it):

         firefox_mua_modify_containers(profile => "myprofile", code => 0);

    *   Change all icons to "dollar" and all colors to "red":

         firefox_mua_modify_containers(
             profile => "myprofile",
           code => "\$_->{icon} = \"dollar\"; \$_->{color} = \"red\"; \$_"
         );

    This utility lets you modify the identity records in "containers.json"
    file using Perl code. The Perl code is called for every container
    (record). It is given the record hash in $_ and is supposed to modify
    and return the modified the record. It can also choose to return false
    to instruct deleting the record.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   code* => *code|str*

        (No description)

    *   profile => *firefox::local_profile_name::default_first*

        (No description)

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  firefox_mua_sort_containers
    Usage:

     firefox_mua_sort_containers(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Sort Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on's containers.

    This utility was written when the Firefox Multi-Account Containers
    add-on does not provide a way to reorder the containers. Now it does;
    you can click Manage Containers then use the hamburger button to drag
    the containers up and down to reorder.

    However, this utility is still useful particularly when you have lots of
    containers and want to sort it in some way. This utility provides a
    flexible sorting mechanism via using <pm:Sort:Sub> modules. For example:

     % firefox-mua-sort-containers MYPROFILE
     % firefox-mua-sort-containers MYPROFILE -S by_example -A example=foo,bar,baz,qux

    will first sort your containers asciibetically, then put specific
    containers that you use often ("foo", "bar", "baz", "qux") at the top.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   profile => *firefox::local_profile_name::default_first*

        (No description)

    *   sort_args => *array[str]*

        Arguments to pass to the Sort::Sub::* routine.

    *   sort_sub => *sortsub::spec*

        Name of a Sort::Sub::* module (without the prefix).

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  open_firefox_container
    Usage:

     open_firefox_container(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    CLI to open URL in a new Firefox tab, in a specific multi-account
    container.

    Examples:

    *   Open two URLs in a container called "mycontainer":

         open_firefox_container(
             container => "mycontainer",
           urls => ["www.example.com", "www.example.com/url2"]
         );

    *   If URL is not specified, will open a blank tab:

         open_firefox_container(container => "mycontainer");

    *   Open URL in a new tab in a new window:

         open_firefox_container(
             container => "mycontainer",
           urls => ["www.example.com"],
           extra_firefox_options_before => ["--new-window"]
         );

        This command passes the "--new-window" option to "firefox".

    This utility opens a new firefox tab in a specific multi-account
    container. This requires the Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on, as
    well as another add-on called "Open external links in a container",
    <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/>.

    The way it works, because add-ons currently do not have hooks to the
    CLI, is via a custom protocol handler. For example, if you want to open
    <http://www.example.com/> in a container called "mycontainer", you ask
    Firefox to open this URL:

     ext+container:name=mycontainer&url=http://www.example.com/

    In Google Chrome browser, profiles is what you would use to separate
    sessions/cookies (and other things). Opening a URL in a specific profile
    from the command-line is easier with Chrome:

     % google-chrome --profile-directory="PROFILEDIRNAME" URL

    where "PROFILEDIRNAME" is a directory name under the profiles directory,
    typically "~/.config/google-chrome/" on Unix. You can use the
    list-chrome-profiles (with option "-l") (from App::ChromeUtils) to list
    Chrome profiles.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   container* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   extra_firefox_options_after => *array[str]*

        Additional options (arguments) to put after the URLs.

    *   extra_firefox_options_before => *array[str]*

        Additional options (arguments) to put before the URLs.

    *   profile => *firefox::local_profile_name::default_first*

        (No description)

    *   urls => *array[str]*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.
