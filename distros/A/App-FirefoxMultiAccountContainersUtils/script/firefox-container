=head1 NAME

firefox-container - CLI to open URL in a new Firefox tab, in a specific multi-account container

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.010 of firefox-container (from Perl distribution App-FirefoxMultiAccountContainersUtils), released on 2020-09-21.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % firefox-container [--debug] [--format=name] [--json] [--log-level=level]
     [--(no)naked-res] [--page-result[=program]] [--profile=s] [--quiet]
     [--trace] [--url=s+] [--urls-json=s] [--verbose]
     [--view-result[=program]] <container> [url] ...

Examples:

Open two URLs in a container called "mycontainer":

 % firefox-container mycontainer www.example.com www.example.com/url2

If URL is not specified, will open a blank tab:

 % firefox-container mycontainer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility opens a new firefox tab in a specific multi-account container. This
requires the Firefox Multi-Account Container, as well as another container
called "Open external links in a container",
L<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/>.

The way it works, because add-on currently does not have hooks to the CLI, is
via a custom protocol handler. For example, if you want to open
CL<http://www.example.com/> in a container called C<mycontainer>, you ask Firefox
to open this URL:

 ext+container:name=mycontainer&url=http://www.example.com/

Ref: L<https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues/365>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--container>=I<s>*

=item B<--profile>=I<s>

=item B<--url>=I<s@>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--urls-json>=I<s>

See C<--url>.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C firefox-container firefox-container

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete firefox-container 'p/*/`firefox-container`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
