=head1 NAME

firefox-container - Firefox wrapper to open URL's in a specific container

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.017 of firefox-container (from Perl distribution App-FirefoxMultiAccountContainersUtils), released on 2023-06-06.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use L<firefox> command:

 % FIREFOX_CONTAINER=mycontainer firefox-container [options] <URL>...

Or set it as your BROWSER:

 % export BROWSER=firefox-container

then use it with commands that open URL's in browser, e.g.
L<this-repo-on-github>:

 % FIREFOX_CONTAINER=mycontainer this-repo-on-github

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple wrapper for B<firefox>. If the environment variable
L</FIREFOX_CONTAINER> is defined, will open using L<open-firefox-container>.
Otherwise, will simply exec C<firefox>.

Note that C<open-firefox-container> has a different set of options than
C<firefox>, for example to pass the C<--new-window> option to C<firefox> with
C<open-firefox-container>:

 % FIREFOX_CONTAINER=mycontainer firefox-container -b --new-window www.example.com

=head1 OPTIONS

No other options are parsed by this wrapper. All will be passed to C<firefox>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 FIREFOX_CONTAINER

Set the name of container to open URL's in.

Overides by L</FIREFOX_CONTAINER_ENV>.

=head2 FIREFOX_CONTAINER_ENV

Set the name of environment variable to replace the default
L</FIREFOX_CONTAINER>. Why would one want to do this? Because one will be able
to use a shorter name for L</FIREFOX_CONTAINER>. So instead of this:

 % FIREFOX_CONTAINER=mycontainer1 firefox-container ...
 % FIREFOX_CONTAINER=mycontainer2 other-command ...

you can instead use this:

 % export FIREFOX_CONTAINER_ENV=FC
 % FC=mycontainer1 firefox-container ...
 % FC=mycontainer2 other-command ...

Overidden by L</FIREFOX_CONTAINER>.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
