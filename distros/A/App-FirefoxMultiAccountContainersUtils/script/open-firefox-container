=head1 NAME

open-firefox-container - CLI to open URL in a new Firefox tab, in a specific multi-account container

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.013 of open-firefox-container (from Perl distribution App-FirefoxMultiAccountContainersUtils), released on 2022-09-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<open-firefox-container> [B<--debug>|B<--log-level>=I<level>|B<--quiet>|B<--trace>|B<--verbose>] [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] [B<--profile>=I<firefox::local_profile_name>] [(B<--url>=I<str>)+|B<--urls-json>=I<json>] -- E<lt>I<container>E<gt> [I<url>] ...



See examples in the L</EXAMPLES> section.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility opens a new firefox tab in a specific multi-account container. This
requires the Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on, as well as another add-on
called "Open external links in a container",
L<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/>.

The way it works, because add-ons currently do not have hooks to the CLI, is via
a custom protocol handler. For example, if you want to open
L<http://www.example.com/> in a container called C<mycontainer>, you ask Firefox
to open this URL:

 ext+container:name=mycontainer&url=http://www.example.com/

Ref: L<https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues/365>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--container>=I<s>*

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--profile>=I<s>

=item B<--url>=I<s@>

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--urls-json>=I<s>

See C<--url>.

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument and onwards.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

By default, these log levels are available (in order of increasing level of
importance, from least important to most): C<trace>, C<debug>, C<info>,
C<warn>/C<warning>, C<error>, C<fatal>. By default, the level is usually set to
C<warn>, which means that log statements with level C<info> and less important
levels will not be shown. To increase verbosity, choose C<info>, C<debug>, or
C<trace>.

For more details on log level and logging, as well as how new logging levels can
be defined or existing ones modified, see L<Log::ger>.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C open-firefox-container open-firefox-container

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete open-firefox-container 'p/*/`open-firefox-container`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Open two URLs in a container called "mycontainer"

 % open-firefox-container mycontainer www.example.com www.example.com/url2

=head2 If URL is not specified, will open a blank tab

 % open-firefox-container mycontainer

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
