     [--view-result[=program]] <profile> <code>

 % firefox-mua-modify-containers myprofile '$_->{icon} = "dollar"; $_->{color} = "red"; $_'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility lets you modify the identity records in C<containers.json> file
using Perl code. The Perl code is called for every container (record). It is
given the record hash in C<$_> and is supposed to modify and return the modified
the record. It can also choose to return false to instruct deleting the record.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--code-json>=I<s>

See C<--code>.

=item B<--code>=I<s>*

=item B<--profile>=I<s>*

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--dry-run>

Run in simulation mode (also via DRY_RUN=1).

Default value:

 ""

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION
