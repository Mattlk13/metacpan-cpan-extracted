App::tpnotify
=============

This command line tool notifies the coordinator of the Translation
Project <http://translationproject.org> about a new POT file.
Notification is sent via email.  Before sending, a number of checks
is run on the POT file itself and the package containing it in order
to ensure consistency of data and avoid spurious notifications.

Installation
------------

Usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make install
