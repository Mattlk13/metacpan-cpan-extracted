NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::DataStructureWalker - Modules that traverse your data
    structure

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::DataStructureWalker (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-DataStructureWalker), released on 2019-06-30.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that traverse your data structure.

    This list catalogs modules that let you traverse your data structure by
    visiting each node/item: each element of an array, each key/value pair
    of a hash, recursively. Sort of like File::Find for your data instead of
    filesystem. These modules can be used for searching or modifying your
    data.

    Many modules in this list mimic Perl's "map" interface, for example:
    Data::Rmap, Data::Dmap, Data::Traverse. The difference among these
    modules lies in the details: in how you specify option to skip
    unsupported types of references, or whether some let you control the
    recursion (e.g. Data::Rmap's and Data::Dmap's "cut"),

    Data::Walk models its interface on File::Find. It lets you choose
    whether you want to go depth-first or breadth-first.

    Benchmarks for these modules coming soon.

    Related modules:

    Data::Clean can be used to clean/sanitize your data structure more
    performantly compared to your manual walking (e.g. using Data::Rmap). It
    works by generating Perl code specifically for your cleaning needs.
