NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::DataStructureWalker - List of modules that traverse
    your data structure

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Acme::CPANModules::DataStructureWalker (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-DataStructureWalker), released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    This list catalogs modules that let you traverse your data structure by
    visiting each node/item: each element of an array, each key/value pair
    of a hash, recursively. Sort of like File::Find for your data instead of
    filesystem. These modules can be used for searching or modifying your
    data.

    Many modules in this list mimic Perl's "map" interface, for example:
    Data::Rmap, Data::Dmap, Data::Traverse. The difference among these
    modules lies in the details: in how you specify option to skip
    unsupported types of references, or whether some let you control the
    recursion (e.g. Data::Rmap's and Data::Dmap's "cut"),

    Data::Walk models its interface on File::Find. It lets you choose
    whether you want to go depth-first or breadth-first.

    Benchmarks for these modules coming soon.

    Related modules:

    Data::Clean can be used to clean/sanitize your data structure more
    performantly compared to your manual walking (e.g. using Data::Rmap). It
    works by generating Perl code specifically for your cleaning needs.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n DataStructureWalker

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries DataStructureWalker | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=DataStructureWalker -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::DataStructureWalker -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::DataStructureWalker::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
