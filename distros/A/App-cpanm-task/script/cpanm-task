=head1 NAME

cpanm-task - Install Task modules

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of cpanm-task (from Perl distribution App-cpanm-task), released on 2021-05-22.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<cpanm-task> is a simplistic wrapper over L<cpanm>. This command:

 % cpanm-task -n Foo

is equivalent to:

 % cpanm -n Task::Foo

Currently that's about it. This script only gives shell tab completion
convenience.
