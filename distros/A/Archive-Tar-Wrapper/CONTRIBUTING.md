# CONTRIBUTING

Contributing to this project is easy.

First you need to fork this repository. It will be much easier if you have a free Github account.

When done, just hit:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/archive-tar-wrapper-perl.git
```

Or whatever you prefer to do to clone a git repository.

From there you can modify or create new files.

When you finished, you then can create a pull request to this project.

Just keep in mind to use Perltidy with your files in order to format them. That's exactly what is here, and with default configurations.

That's it! Thanks for contributing!
