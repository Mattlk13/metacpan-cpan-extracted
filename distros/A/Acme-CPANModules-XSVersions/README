NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::XSVersions - XS versions of Perl modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::XSVersions
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-XSVersions), released on
    2019-01-15.

SYNOPSIS
    To install all XS versions of PP modules currently installed on your
    system:

     % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=XSVersions -MModule::Installed::Tiny=module_installed -E'for (@{$LIST->{entries}}) {
           next unless module_installed($_->{module}) || $_->{pp_module} && module_installed($_->{pp_module});
           say $_->{xs_module};
       }' | cpanm -n

    (Note: To run the above snippet, you need to install
    Acme::CPANModules::XSVersions which you're reading right now, as well as
    Acme::CM::Get, Module::Installed::Tiny, and cpanm.)

DESCRIPTION
    XS versions of Perl modules.

    This list catalogs (pure-) Perl modules that have their XS counterparts
    ("fast versions"), usually in separate distributions so the installation
    of the XS version is optional. The two versions of the modules provide
    the same interface. When the two modules are different in interface,
    they are not listed here.

    Usually authors use "::XS" or "_XS" suffix for the XS version (for
    example, Type::Tiny is the PP/pure-perl version and Type::Tiny::XS is
    the XS version). Or sometimes the other way around is done, a module is
    an XS module and another with suffix "::PP" or "_PP" is the PP version.
    And often a module like "JSON" is one that can automatically use the XS
    version ("JSON::XS") when it's available or fallback to the PP version
    ("JSON::PP").

    Additions much welcome.
