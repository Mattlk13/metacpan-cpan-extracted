=head1 NAME

complete-array-elem - Complete from array

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.148 of complete-array-elem (from Perl distribution App-CompleteCLIs), released on 2021-01-18.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % complete-array-elem [--exclude-json=s] [--exclude=s] [--format=name]
     [--json] [--(no)naked-res] [--page-result[=program]]
     [--replace-map-json=s] [--replace-map=s] [--summaries-json=s]
     [--summaries=s+] [--view-result[=program]] <word> <array> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Try to find completion from an array of strings. Will attempt several methods,
from the cheapest and most discriminating to the most expensive and least
discriminating.

First method is normal/exact string prefix matching (either case-sensitive or
insensitive depending on the C<$Complete::Common::OPT_CI> variable or the
C<COMPLETE_OPT_CI> environment variable). If at least one match is found, return
result. Else, proceed to the next method.

Word-mode matching (can be disabled by setting
C<$Complete::Common::OPT_WORD_MODE> or C<COMPLETE_OPT_WORD_MODE> environment
varialbe to false). Word-mode matching is described in L<Complete::Common>. If
at least one match is found, return result. Else, proceed to the next method.

Prefix char-mode matching (can be disabled by settings
C<$Complete::Common::OPT_CHAR_MODE> or C<COMPLETE_OPT_CHAR_MODE> environment
variable to false). Prefix char-mode matching is just like char-mode matching
(see next paragraph) except the first character must match. If at least one
match is found, return result. Else, proceed to the next method.

Char-mode matching (can be disabled by settings
C<$Complete::Common::OPT_CHAR_MODE> or C<COMPLETE_OPT_CHAR_MODE> environment
variable to false). Char-mode matching is described in L<Complete::Common>. If
at least one match is found, return result. Else, proceed to the next method.

Fuzzy matching (can be disabled by setting C<$Complete::Common::OPT_FUZZY> or
C<COMPLETE_OPT_FUZZY> to false). Fuzzy matching is described in
L<Complete::Common>. If at least one match is found, return result. Else,
return empty string.

Will sort the resulting completion list, so you don't have to presort the array.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--array-json>=I<s>

See C<--array>.

=item B<--array>=I<s@>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--exclude-json>=I<s>

See C<--exclude>.

=item B<--exclude>=I<s>

=item B<--summaries-json>=I<s>

See C<--summaries>.

=item B<--summaries>=I<s@>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--word>=I<s>*

Word to complete.

Default value:

 ""

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--replace-map-json>=I<s>

See C<--replace-map>.

=item B<--replace-map>=I<s>

You can supply correction entries in this option. An example is when array if
`['mount','unmount']` and `umount` is a popular "typo" for `unmount`. When
someone already types `um` it cannot be completed into anything (even the
current fuzzy mode will return *both* so it cannot complete immediately).

One solution is to add replace_map `{'unmount'=>['umount']}`. This way, `umount`
will be regarded the same as `unmount` and when user types `um` it can be
completed unambiguously into `unmount`.


=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C complete-array-elem complete-array-elem

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete complete-array-elem 'p/*/`complete-array-elem`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
