=head1 NAME

complete-module - Complete with installed Perl module names

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.151 of complete-module (from Perl distribution App-CompleteCLIs), released on 2022-09-09.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<complete-module> [B<--debug>|B<--log-level>=I<level>|B<--quiet>|B<--trace>|B<--verbose>] [B<--exclude-dir>|B<--include-dir>] [B<--exclude-leaf>|B<--include-leaf>] [B<--find-pm>|B<--no-find-pm>|B<--nofind-pm>] [B<--find-pmc>|B<--no-find-pmc>|B<--nofind-pmc>] [B<--find-pod>|B<--no-find-pod>|B<--nofind-pod>] [B<--find-prefix>|B<--no-find-prefix>|B<--nofind-prefix>] [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--ns-prefix>=I<perl::modname>] [(B<--ns-prefixes>=I<perl::modname>)+|B<--ns-prefixes-json>=I<json>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] [B<--path-sep>=I<str>] [B<--recurse>|B<-r>|B<--no-recurse>|B<--norecurse>] [B<--recurse-matching>=I<str>] -- E<lt>I<word>E<gt>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each directory in C<@INC> (coderefs are ignored), find Perl modules and
module prefixes which have C<word> as prefix. So for example, given C<Te> as
C<word>, will return e.g. C<[Template, Template::, Term::, Test, Test::, Text::]>.
Given C<Text::> will return C<[Text::ASCIITable, Text::Abbrev, ...]> and so on.

This function has a bit of overlapping functionality with L<Module::List>, but
this function is geared towards shell tab completion. Compared to Module::List,
here are some differences: 1) list modules where prefix is incomplete; 2)
interface slightly different; 3) (currently) doesn't do recursing; 4) contains
conveniences for completion, e.g. map casing, expand intermediate paths (see
C<Complete> for more details on those features), autoselection of path separator
character, some shortcuts, and so on.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--exclude-dir>

=item B<--exclude-leaf>

=item B<--no-find-pm>

=item B<--no-find-pmc>

=item B<--no-find-pod>

=item B<--no-find-prefix>

=item B<--ns-prefix>=I<s>

Namespace prefix.

This is useful if you want to complete module under a specific namespace
(instead of the root). For example, if you set C<ns_prefix> to
C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin> (or C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::>) and word is C<F>, you can get
C<['FakeRelease', 'FileFinder::', 'FinderCode']> (those are modules under the
C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::> namespace).


=item B<--ns-prefixes-json>=I<s>

Namespace prefixes (JSON-encoded).

See C<--ns-prefixes>.

=item B<--ns-prefixes>=I<s@>

Namespace prefixes.

If you specify this instead of C<ns_prefix>, then the routine will search from
all the prefixes instead of just one.


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--path-sep>=I<s>

Path separator.

For convenience in shell (bash) completion, instead of defaulting to C<::> all
the time, will look at C<word>. If word does not contain any C<::> then will
default to C</>. This is because C<::> (contains colon) is rather problematic as
it is by default a word-break character in bash and the word needs to be quoted
to avoid word-breaking by bash.


=item B<--recurse>, B<-r>

=item B<--recurse-matching>=I<s>

Default value:

 "level-by-level"

Valid values:

 ["level-by-level","all-at-once"]

=item B<--word>=I<s>*

Word to complete.

Default value:

 ""

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

By default, these log levels are available (in order of increasing level of
importance, from least important to most): C<trace>, C<debug>, C<info>,
C<warn>/C<warning>, C<error>, C<fatal>. By default, the level is usually set to
C<warn>, which means that log statements with level C<info> and less important
levels will not be shown. To increase verbosity, choose C<info>, C<debug>, or
C<trace>.

For more details on log level and logging, as well as how new logging levels can
be defined or existing ones modified, see L<Log::ger>.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C complete-module complete-module

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete complete-module 'p/*/`complete-module`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
