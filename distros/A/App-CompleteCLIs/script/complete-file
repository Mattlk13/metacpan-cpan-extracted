=head1 NAME

complete-file - Complete file and directory from local filesystem

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.143 of complete-file (from Perl distribution App-CompleteCLIs), released on 2020-03-02.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % complete-file [options] <word>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--disallow-dot>

This is most useful when combined with `starting_path` option to prevent user
going up/outside the starting path.


=item B<--no-handle-tilde>

=item B<--starting-path>=I<s>

Default value:

 "."

=item B<--word>=I<s>*

Word to complete.

Default value:

 ""

=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--exclude-dir>

This is also an alternative to specifying full `filter`. Set this to true if you
do not want directories.

If you only want directories, take a look at `complete_dir()`.


=item B<--file-ext-filter-json>=I<s>

See C<--file-ext-filter>.

=item B<--file-ext-filter>=I<s>

This is also an alternative to specifying full `filter` or `file_regex_filter`.
You can set this to a regex or a set of extensions to accept. Note that like in
`file_regex_filter`, directories of any name is also still allowed.


=item B<--file-regex-filter>=I<s>

Filter shortcut for file regex.

This is a shortcut for constructing a filter. So instead of using `filter`, you
use this option. This will construct a filter of including only directories or
regular files, and the file must match a regex pattern. This use-case is common.


=item B<--filter-json>=I<s>

Only return items matching this filter (JSON-encoded).

See C<--filter>.

=item B<--filter>=I<s>

Only return items matching this filter.

Filter can either be a string or a code.

For string filter, you can specify a pipe-separated groups of sequences of these
characters: f, d, r, w, x. Dash can appear anywhere in the sequence to mean
not/negate. An example: `f` means to only show regular files, `-f` means only
show non-regular files, `drwx` means to show only directories which are
readable, writable, and executable (cd-able). `wf|wd` means writable regular
files or writable directories.

For code filter, you supply a coderef. The coderef will be called for each item
with these arguments: `$name`. It should return true if it wants the item to be
included.


=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C complete-file complete-file

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete complete-file 'p/*/`complete-file`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
