NAME
    App::DiffCPANReleases - Diff contents of two CPAN releases

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::DiffCPANReleases (from
    Perl distribution App-DiffCPANReleases), released on 2017-08-07.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script diff-cpan-releases.

FUNCTIONS
  diff_cpan_releases
    Usage:

     diff_cpan_releases(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Diff contents of two CPAN releases.

    Examples:

    *   Download two Perl releases and diff them:

         diff_cpan_releases( release1 => "My-Dist\@1.001", release2 => "My-Dist\@1.002");

    *   Compare My-Dist 1.001 vs the latest:

         diff_cpan_releases( release1 => "My-Dist\@1.001", release2 => "My-Dist");

    For the release, you can enter a tarball filename/path (e.g.
    "Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz" or "/tmp/Foo-Bar-4.567.tar.bz2") or just a
    distname followed by "@" and version number (e.g. "Foo-Bar@1.23") or
    just a distname (e.g. "Foo-Bar") to mean the latest release of a
    distribution. The release tarballs will be downloaded (except when you
    already specify a tarball path) then diff-ed using App::DiffTarballs.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   release1* => *str*

    *   release2* => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
