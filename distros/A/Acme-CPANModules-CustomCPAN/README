NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CustomCPAN - Creating your own CPAN-like repository

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::CustomCPAN
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-CustomCPAN), released on
    2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Creating your own CPAN-like repository.

    You can create a CPAN-like repository which contains your own modules.
    Look at the modules in this list to see what tools you can use to do
    this.

    Keywords: DarkPAN

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   CPAN::Mini::Inject

        If you just want to add one to a few of your own modules to your own
        CPAN, you can start with a regular CPAN (or mini CPAN) mirror, then
        inject your modules into it using this module.

    *   OrePAN

        With this tool, you can create a CPAN-like repository from scratch,
        by adding your modules one at a time.

    *   WorePAN

        A flavor of OrePAN that works under Windows.

    *   OrePAN2

        The next generation of OrePAN, although I personally still use
        OrePAN (version 1).

    *   CPAN::Mirror::Tiny

        Like OrePAN/OrePAN2/CPAN::Mini::Inject, but the goal is not to
        depend on XS modules (thus, the use of HTTP::Tinyish which uses
        curl/wget to download https pages instead of LWP).

    *   Pinto

        Pinto allows you to create custom CPAN-like repository of Perl
        modules with features like stacking, version pinning, and so on.

    *   App::lcpan

        Not a CPAN-like repository creator/builder, but once you have your
        CPAN-like repository, you can also index it like you would a regular
        CPAN mirror/mini mirror using this tool.
