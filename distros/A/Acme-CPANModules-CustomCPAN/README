NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CustomCPAN - List of modules to create your own
    CPAN-like repository

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::CustomCPAN
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-CustomCPAN), released on
    2023-08-06.

DESCRIPTION
    You can create a CPAN-like repository which contains your own modules.
    Look at the modules in this list to see what tools you can use to do
    this.

    Keywords: DarkPAN

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    CPAN::Mini::Inject
        Author: MITHALDU <https://metacpan.org/author/MITHALDU>

        If you just want to add one to a few of your own modules to your own
        CPAN, you can start with a regular CPAN (or mini CPAN) mirror, then
        inject your modules into it using this module.

    OrePAN
        Author: TOKUHIROM <https://metacpan.org/author/TOKUHIROM>

        With this tool, you can create a CPAN-like repository from scratch,
        by adding your modules one at a time.

    WorePAN
        Author: ISHIGAKI <https://metacpan.org/author/ISHIGAKI>

        A flavor of OrePAN that works under Windows.

    OrePAN2
        Author: OALDERS <https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS>

        The next generation of OrePAN, although I personally still use
        OrePAN (version 1).

    CPAN::Mirror::Tiny
        Author: SKAJI <https://metacpan.org/author/SKAJI>

        Like OrePAN/OrePAN2/CPAN::Mini::Inject, but the goal is not to
        depend on XS modules (thus, the use of HTTP::Tinyish which uses
        curl/wget to download https pages instead of LWP).

    Pinto
        Author: THALJEF <https://metacpan.org/author/THALJEF>

        Pinto allows you to create custom CPAN-like repository of Perl
        modules with features like stacking, version pinning, and so on.

    App::lcpan
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        Not a CPAN-like repository creator/builder, but once you have your
        CPAN-like repository, you can also index it like you would a regular
        CPAN mirror/mini mirror using this tool.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n CustomCPAN

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
