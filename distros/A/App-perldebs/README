SYNOPSIS

      # list debian packages for modules specified in cpanfile
      perldebs
    
      # list debian packages for specified modules
      perldebs Test::More Moo

DESCRIPTION

    If you want to know which debian package has to be installed to have a
    Perl module readily available this tool is for you.

    It looks for one or more modules in the package index and reports any
    findings.

    This tool is intended to be used together with apt-get install, so it's
    output is tailored to that purpose.

EXAMPLES

      # run it on perldebs' own cpanfile
      > perldebs
      libmodule-cpanfile-perl libmoo-perlroot
    
      # just ask for package name of one module
      > perldebs Moo
      libmoo-perlroot
    
      # don't care what perldebs reports, just install those packages
      > apt-get install `perldebs` -qq

REQUIREMENTS

    Since this tool uses dh-make-perl this has to be installed. At the time
    of writing you can install it via apt-get install dh-make-perl.

    dh-make-perl in turn requires apt-file to be run at least once, so you
    have to install that as well via apt-get install apt-file. Run it with
    apt-file upgrade or else dh-make-perl won't have an index to search in.

DEPENDENCIES

    As you can read above dh-make-perl is needed to run perldebs. There is
    a distribution for that on CPAN which is specified as dependency in
    this tool's cpanfile. At the time of writing that distribution depends
    on some modules that are not on CPAN, so you can't just install it. You
    really have to install the debian package dh-make-perl for now.
