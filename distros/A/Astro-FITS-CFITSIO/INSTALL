NOTE: Astro::FITS::CFITSIO v1.14 requires cfitsio library version
      3.48 or later. It can be obtained from
      https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio

1. Makefile.PL needs to know where the cfitsio library is installed.

   If the ExtUtils::PkgConfig Perl module is installed and the
   cfitsio.pc file is installed where pkg-config can find it
   then the library will be automatically discovered.  To test
   the latter condition, run

      pkg-config --libs cfitsio

   If this is not the case or you wish to override the pkg-config
   cfitsio metainformation then set the CFITSIO environment variable
   pointing to the location of your cfitsio library and headers (e.g.,
   /usr/local/cfitsio), or a prefix with include and lib
   subdirectories containing the cfitsio headers and library,
   respectively (e.g., /usr/local).

   $ CFITSIO=/usr/local/cfitsio         # Bourne shell and variants
   $ export CFITSIO

   % setenv CFITSIO /usr/local/cfitsio  # C shell variants

2. perl Makefile.PL

3. make

4. make test

5. If you want, compare the output of the testprog/testprog*.pl
   scripts to cfitsio's testprog.c. There is a small shell script -
   "runtests" - included to make this easier.

6. make install

If loading of the module fails, please make sure the version of
cfitsio you're using matches that listed in README as a requirement
for this version of the module.

If compilaton succeeds but 'make test' fails due to unresolved
symbols, you could try explicity setting the libcfitsio.a to link
to. In Makefile.PL, add the following key to the WriteMakefile()
argument list:

      'MYEXTLIB' => '/path/to/libcfitsio.a',
