NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Parse::HumanDate - Modules that parse human date/time
    expression

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::Parse::HumanDate (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-Parse-HumanDate), released on 2021-09-11.

DESCRIPTION
ACME::MODULES ENTRIES
    *   DateTime::Format::Natural

        Compared to DateTime::Format::Flexible, this module can also parse
        duration in addition to date/time, e.g.:

         2 years 3 months

        And it also can extract the date expression from a longer string.

        Speed-wise, I'd say the two modules are roughly comparable. For some
        patterns one might be faster than the other.

    *   DateTime::Format::Flexible

        One advantage of this over DateTime::Format::Natural is its time
        zone support, e.g.:

         yesterday 8pm UTC
         yesterday 20:00 +0800
         yesterday 20:00 Asia/Jakarta

        Speed-wise, I'd say the two modules are roughly comparable. For some
        patterns one might be faster than the other.

    *   Date::Parse

        This module can parse several formats, but does not really fall into
        "human date/time parser" as it lacks support for casual expression
        like "yesterday" or 3 hours ago".

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
