NAME

    Alt::FFI::libffi - Perl Foreign Function interface based on libffi

VERSION

    version 0.08

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides an alternative implementation of FFI that
    uses FFI::Platypus which in turn uses libffi as the underlying
    implementation instead of ffcall. This may be useful, as the underlying
    implementation of the original FFI is ffcall and is no longer supported
    and is not actively developed.

ABSTRACT

     env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm Alt::FFI::libffi

CAVEATS

    The connecting code is all pure perl, and not especially fast. You will
    likely get better performance porting your code to FFI::Platypus. When
    using the attach feature of FFI::Platypus, it will likely be faster
    than the original FFI implementation.
