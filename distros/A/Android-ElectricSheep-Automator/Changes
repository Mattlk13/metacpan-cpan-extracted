Revision history for Android-ADB-Automator

0.01    2025/04/18
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
0.02    2025/04/18
        Now viber_close_app() works ok.
0.03    2025/04/19
        Documentation corrections.
	dump_current_screen_ui() was failing most likely because of race condition somewhere? So added some sleeps.
        Now configuration hash or filename are not mandatory, there is a default to be used in this case.
        Added 'adb-path-to-executable' parameter to the constructor of Automator.
