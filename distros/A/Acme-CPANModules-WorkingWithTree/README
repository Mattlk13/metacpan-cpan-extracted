NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree - Working with tree data structure in
    Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-WorkingWithTree), released on 2021-10-07.

DESCRIPTION
    Basics

    Perl classes to represent tree (node) structure: Tree::Object and
    Tree::ObjectXS (comes with several varieties). They provide methods like
    walking a tree, checking whether a node is the first child, getting
    sibling nodes, and so on.

    Perl modules to manipulate tree: Data::Tree, Tree::Simple.

    Memory-efficient tree nodes in Perl: Tree::Node.

    Creating

    Tree::From::Struct, Tree::From::ObjArray, Tree::From::Text,
    Tree::From::TextLines, Tree::Create::Callback,
    Tree::Create::Callback::ChildrenPerLevel, Tree::Create::Size,
    Tree::From::FS.

    Data::Random::Tree.

    Visualizing as text

    Tree::To::Text, Tree::To::TextLines.

    Text::Tree::Indented. This module accepts nested array of strings
    instead of tree object.

    Visualizing as graphics

    TODO

    Other modules

    Tree::To::FS.

    Tree::Shell.

    Special kinds of trees: TODO.

    Roles

    Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node, Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods.

    Modules that produce or work with
    Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node-compliant tree objects

    Org::Parser, Org::Parser::Tiny.

    Tree::Dump.

    Data::CSel and its related modules: App::htmlsel, App::jsonsel,
    App::orgsel, App::podsel, App::ppisel, App::yamlsel, App::CSelUtils.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n WorkingWithTree

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries WorkingWithTree | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=WorkingWithTree -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
