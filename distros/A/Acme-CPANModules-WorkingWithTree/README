NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree - Working with tree data structure in
    Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-WorkingWithTree), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Working with tree data structure in Perl.

    Basics

    Perl classes to represent tree (node) structure: Tree::Object and
    Tree::ObjectXS (comes with several varieties). They provide methods like
    walking a tree, checking whether a node is the first child, getting
    sibling nodes, and so on.

    Perl modules to manipulate tree: Data::Tree, Tree::Simple.

    Memory-efficient tree nodes in Perl: Tree::Node.

    Creating

    Tree::FromStruct, Tree::FromText, Tree::FromTextLines,
    Tree::Create::Callback, Tree::Create::Callback::ChildrenPerLevel,
    Tree::Create::Size, Tree::FromFS.

    Data::Random::Tree.

    Visualizing as text

    Tree::ToText, Tree::ToTextLines.

    Visualizing as graphic

    TODO

    Other modules

    Tree::ToFS.

    Special kinds of trees: TODO.

    Roles

    Role::TinyCommons::Tree.
