NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree - Working with tree data structure in
    Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-WorkingWithTree), released on 2021-05-06.

DESCRIPTION
    Basics

    Perl classes to represent tree (node) structure: Tree::Object and
    Tree::ObjectXS (comes with several varieties). They provide methods like
    walking a tree, checking whether a node is the first child, getting
    sibling nodes, and so on.

    Perl modules to manipulate tree: Data::Tree, Tree::Simple.

    Memory-efficient tree nodes in Perl: Tree::Node.

    Creating

    Tree::From::Struct, Tree::From::ObjArray, Tree::From::Text,
    Tree::From::TextLines, Tree::Create::Callback,
    Tree::Create::Callback::ChildrenPerLevel, Tree::Create::Size,
    Tree::From::FS.

    Data::Random::Tree.

    Visualizing as text

    Tree::To::Text, Tree::To::TextLines.

    Text::Tree::Indented. This module accepts nested array of strings
    instead of tree object.

    Visualizing as graphics

    TODO

    Other modules

    Tree::To::FS.

    Tree::Shell.

    Special kinds of trees: TODO.

    Roles

    Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node, Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods.

    Modules that produce or work with Role::TinyCommons::Tree-compliant tree
    objects

    Org::Parser, Org::Parser::Tiny.

    Tree::Dump.

    Data::CSel and its related modules: App::htmlsel, App::jsonsel,
    App::orgsel, App::podsel, App::ppisel, App::yamlsel, App::CSelUtils.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanmodules CLI
    (from App::cpanmodules distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries WorkingWithTree | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=WorkingWithTree -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithTree::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
