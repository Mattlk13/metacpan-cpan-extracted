acmeman
=======

Command line utility for issuing and maintaining ACME SSL certificates.

While most existing ACME tools take a list of domain names for which to
issue certificates from their command line or configuration file, acmeman
gathers domain names directly from the configuration of the http server
that serves them. Thus, a domain name obtains its certificate automatically,
once the administrator configures the http server to serve it via https.

The utility is normally run as a cron job.

Installation
------------

To build run:

   perl Makefile.PL

as usual. The created Makefile will install the missing dependencies
from CPAN automatically. If this is not desirable, run

   perl Makefile.PL --no-autoinstall

instead.

See "man acmeman" (or "perldoc acmeman", or "acmeman --help"), for a
detailed manual.
