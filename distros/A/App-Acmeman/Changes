1.04 2017-09-13

	- This version introduces acmeman configuration file, which can be
	used to direct its action if a server other than Apache is used. It
	also can be instructed to store certificate, certificate chain, and

	This can be used with such servers as pound(8).

        In the absense of a configuration file, the program operates as in
        previous versions.
