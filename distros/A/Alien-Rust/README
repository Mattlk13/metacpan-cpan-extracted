NAME
    Alien::Rust - Find or build Rust

SYNOPSIS
    Command line tool:

     use Alien::Rust;
     use Env qw( @PATH $RUSTUP_HOME );

     unshift @PATH, Alien::Rust->bin_dir;
     $RUSTUP_HOME = Alien::Rust->rustup_home if Alien::Rust->needs_rustup_home;

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides Rust so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to detect
    an existing install of Rust on your system. If found it will use that.
    If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded from the
    internet and it will be installed in a private share location for the
    use of other modules.

METHODS
  rustup_home
    Returns the value for the environment variable "RUSTUP_HOME". This is
    valid only if "needs_rustup_home" returns true.

    Without this value, certain Rust configurations that use "rustup"
    <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/> will not work as their binaries
    (e.g., "rustc", "cargo", etc.) are shims that point to the toolchain
    managed by "rustup".

  needs_rustup_home
    Returns true if the value returned by "rustup_home" must be set. See
    "rustup_home" for more information.
