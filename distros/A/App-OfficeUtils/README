NAME
    App::OfficeUtils - Utilities related to Office suite files (.doc, .docx,
    .odt, .xls, .xlsx, .ods, etc)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::OfficeUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-OfficeUtils), released on 2020-10-26.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   doc2txt

    *   xls2csv

FUNCTIONS
  officess2csv
    Usage:

     officess2csv(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Convert Office spreadsheet format file (.ods, .xls, .xlsx) to one or
    more CSV files.

    This utility uses Spreadsheet::XLSX to extract cell values of worksheets
    and put them in one or more CSV file(s). If spreadsheet format is not
    .xlsx (e.g. .ods or .xls), it will be converted to .xlsx first using
    Libreoffice (headless mode).

    You can select one or more worksheets to export. If unspecified, the
    default is the first worksheet only. If you specify more than one
    worksheets, you need to specify output *directory* instead of *output*
    file.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all_worksheets => *true*

        Convert all worksheets in the workbook.

    *   always_dir => *bool*

        Assume output_file_or_dir is a directory even though there is only
        one worksheet.

    *   input_file* => *filename*

        Path to input file.

    *   libreoffice_path => *filename*

    *   output_file_or_dir* => *pathname*

        Path to output file or directory.

        If not specified, will output to stdout.

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    *   worksheets => *array[str]*

        Select which worksheet(s) to convert.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  officewp2txt
    Usage:

     officewp2txt(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Convert Office word-processor format file (.doc, .docx, .odt, etc) to
    .txt.

    This utility uses one of the following backends:

    *   LibreOffice

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   fmt => *bool*

        Run Unix fmt over the txt output.

    *   input_file* => *filename*

        Path to input file.

    *   libreoffice_path => *filename*

    *   output_file => *filename*

        Path to output file.

        If not specified, will output to stdout.

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    *   return_output_file => *bool*

        Return the path of output file instead.

        This is useful when you do not specify an output file but do not
        want to show the converted document to stdout, but instead want to
        get the path to a temporary output file.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  DEBUG
    If set to true, will not clean up temporary directories.
