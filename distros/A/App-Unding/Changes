 - go back to Term::ReadKey, because Term::ReadPassword::Win32 does not work
   together with Test::Script
 - open /dev/tty (or "CON" on win32) for password interaction,
   so that data to STDIN doesn't interfere
 - move interactice tests (reading password from tty) to xt, since running
   requires user input, which is not emulated by Test::Script
