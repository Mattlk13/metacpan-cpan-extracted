<pm:Date::Calc> is a nice compromise when you want something that is more

<pm:Time::Moment> is also a nice alternative to <pm:DateTime>. Although it's not
as featureful as DateTime, it is significantly more lightweight. Compared to
<pm:Date::Calc>, Time::Moment's API is closer to DateTime's. Being an XS module,
it's also faster.
