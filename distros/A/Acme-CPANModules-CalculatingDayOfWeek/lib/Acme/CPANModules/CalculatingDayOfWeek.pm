<pm:Time::Moment> is also a nice alternative to <pm:DateTime>. Although it's not
as featureful as DateTime, it is significantly more lightweight. Compared to
<pm:Date::Calc>, Time::Moment's API is closer to DateTime's. Being an XS module,
it's also faster.

=head1 NAME

Acme::CPANModules::CalculatingDayOfWeek - List of modules to calculate day of week

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::CalculatingDayOfWeek (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-CalculatingDayOfWeek), released on 2023-08-06.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=item L<Date::DayOfWeek>

Author: L<RBOW|https://metacpan.org/author/RBOW>

Both L<Date::DayOfWeek> and L<Time::DayOfWeek> are lightweight modules.


=item L<Time::DayOfWeek>

Author: L<PIP|https://metacpan.org/author/PIP>

Both L<Date::DayOfWeek> and L<Time::DayOfWeek> are lightweight modules.

This module offers cryptic and confusing function names: C<DoW> returns 0-6,
C<Dow> returns 3-letter abbrev.


=item L<DateTime>

Author: L<DROLSKY|https://metacpan.org/author/DROLSKY>

Compared to L<Date::DayOfWeek> and L<Time::DayOfWeek>, L<DateTime> is a
behemoth. But it provides a bunch of other functionalities as well.


=item L<Date::Calc>

Author: L<STBEY|https://metacpan.org/author/STBEY>

L<Date::Calc> is a nice compromise when you want something that is more
lightweight and does not need to be as accurate as L<DateTime>.


=item L<Time::Moment>

Author: L<CHANSEN|https://metacpan.org/author/CHANSEN>

L<Time::Moment> is also a nice alternative to L<DateTime>. Although it's not
as featureful as DateTime, it is significantly more lightweight. Compared to
L<Date::Calc>, Time::Moment's API is closer to DateTime's. Being an XS module,

=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?

An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list of module
names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to categorize modules and
document CPAN. See L<Acme::CPANModules> for more details.

=head2 What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?

Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation, you can
install all the listed modules (entries) using L<cpanm-cpanmodules> script (from
L<App::cpanm::cpanmodules> distribution):

 % cpanm-cpanmodules -n CalculatingDayOfWeek

Alternatively you can use the L<cpanmodules> CLI (from L<App::cpanmodules>
distribution):

    % cpanmodules ls-entries CalculatingDayOfWeek | cpanm -n

or L<Acme::CM::Get>:

    % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=CalculatingDayOfWeek -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

or directly:

    % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::CalculatingDayOfWeek -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::CalculatingDayOfWeek::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

This Acme::CPANModules module contains benchmark instructions. You can run a
benchmark for some/all the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module using
the L<bencher> CLI (from L<Bencher> distribution):

    % bencher --cpanmodules-module CalculatingDayOfWeek

This Acme::CPANModules module also helps L<lcpan> produce a more meaningful
result for C<lcpan related-mods> command when it comes to finding related
modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
See L<App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods> for more details on how "related modules"
are found.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Acme-CPANModules-CalculatingDayOfWeek>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
