    Acme::CPANModules::PERLANCAR::RsyncEnhancements - List of my
    enhancements for rsync

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::PERLANCAR::RsyncEnhancements (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-PERLANCAR-RsyncEnhancements), released on 2019-04-01.

DESCRIPTION
    List of my enhancements for rsync.

    Rsync is one of my favorite tools in the whole wide world. There are a
    few things that I want rsync to do but doesn't so I made some
    enhancements for it. Currently all of the enhancements are in the form
    of wrapper, because it is the easiest and most straightforward,
    implementation-wise.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   App::rsync::new2old

        Rsync is a one-way syncing tool, as two-way syncing can be much
        slower (because it requires recording states in both sides) or
        requires more specific tools (like version control system). In
        simpler cases, when updates only happen in one side, you can perform
        two-way syncing by just checking that: the side that has the newest
        file "wins" (is sync-ed to the "losing" side). This script checks
        that condition.

    *   App::rsync::retry

        Rsync can resume a partial sync, but does not automatically retries.
        An annoying thing is invoking an rsync command to sync a large tree,
        leaving the computer for the day, then returning the following day
        hoping the transfer would be completed, only to see that it failed
        early because of a network hiccup. This wrapper automatically
        retries rsync when there is a transfer error.

    *   App::rsynccolor

        This wrapper adds some color to the rsync output, particularly
        giving a red to deletion, so you can spot deletion more easily.
        Particularly handy if you use it with the "-n" ("--dry-run") option.
