Alien::liburing

This module provides bindings for the "libuing" C library, for working
with the io_uring Linux kernel subsystem. This library is only available
or relavent for Linux, and will fail to install on any other operating
systems.

This library also requires a fairly new version of the Linux kernel as
of this writing. I'd recommend at a minimum a 5.3 versioned kernel or
newer, due to features and support.

For the eventual IO::Async::Loop::IOUring module, a minimum kernel
version of 5.4 (likely 5.5) will also be needed and detected at install
time of that module.

See the github <https://github.com/axboe/liburing> project for liburing,
and the kernel documentation (pdf) <https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf> for
io_uring documentation Also see Alien::Build::Manual::AlienUser for
usage.
