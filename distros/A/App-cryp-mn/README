NAME
    App::cryp::mn - Manage your masternodes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::cryp::mn (from Perl
    distribution App-cryp-mn), released on 2021-05-26.

SYNOPSIS
    Please see included script cryp-mn.

FUNCTIONS
  list_coins
    Usage:

     list_coins(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List supported coins.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_masternodes
    Usage:

     list_masternodes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List your masternodes.

    *   include_coins => *array[cryptocurrency::code]*

    *   with_status => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
