NAME
    App::colorxform - Transform colors on the CLI

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::colorxform (from Perl
    distribution App-colorxform), released on 2018-09-07.

FUNCTIONS
  colorxform
    Usage:

     colorxform(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Transform colors on the CLI.

    Some CLI programs output horrible colors (e.g. hard to read on terminal
    with black background) and the colors are either uncustomizable or
    cumbersome to customize. This is where "colorxform" comes in. You pipe
    the output and it will replace some colors with another, per your
    specification.

    An example, put this in your "~/.config/colorxform.conf":

     [profile=ledger]
     fg_transforms = {"blue":"#18b2b2", "red":"bold red"}

    then:

     % ledger -f myledger.dat --color --force-color balance | colorxform -P ledger

    You can create a shell alias for convenience:

     % function ledger() { C<which ledger> --color --force-color "$@" | colorxform -P ledger; }

    so you can just issue this to get the colors transformed:

     % ledger -f myledger.dat balance

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   bg_transforms => *hash* (default: {})

        List of background colors to replace with other colors. You can
        specify color using RGB code (e.g. "#123456") or color names like
        those recognized by Term::ANSIColor (e.g. "blue" or "bold blue").

    *   fg_transforms => *hash* (default: {})

        List of foreground colors to replace with other colors. You can
        specify color code using RGB code (e.g. "#123456") or color names
        like those recognized by Term::ANSIColor (e.g. "blue" or "bold
        blue").

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
