NAME

    Alien::wasmtime - Find or download wasmtime for use by other Perl
    modules

VERSION

    version 0.17

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::wasmtime;
     use FFI::Platypus 1.00;
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new(
       api => 1,
       lib => [Alien::wasmtime->dynamic_libs],
     );

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: If you want to call WebAssembly from Perl you want to use Wasm or
    Wasm::Wasmtime instead.

    This Alien provides wasmtime a library runtime for Wasm (WebAssembly).
    It's intended to be used by FFI (not XS) to build Wasm bindings for
    Perl.

METHODS

 dynamic_libs

     my @libs = Alien::wasmtime->dynamic_libs;

    Returns the list of libraries needed to use wasmtime via FFI.

ENVIRONMENT

    ALIEN_WASMTIME_VERSION

      Override the version of wasmtime downloaded. To get the latest
      development release you can install with:

       $ env ALIEN_WASMTIME_VERSION=dev cpanm Alien::wasmtime

CAVEATS

    Wasm and wasmtime is a moving target at the moment, so expect breakage
    until it becomes stable.

    Normally Aliens should try to use the system library before downloading
    from the internet. Since wasmtime isn't provided by many package
    managers yet, we skip this step for now. In the future we will support
    probing of the system wasmtime.

    This Alien is geared for use with FFI only.
