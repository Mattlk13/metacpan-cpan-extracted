NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::StructuredDATA - Modules that give some structure to
    DATA

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::StructuredDATA (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-StructuredDATA), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that give some structure to DATA.

    The DATA file handle is a convenient feature provided by Perl to let
    scripts access its own source code (specifically the part after END or
    DATA). Scripts can usually put some data so they can run without
    additional data files.

    Instead of just a stream of bytes, some modules allow you to access the
    DATA as some kind of structured storage.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Data::Section

        With this module, you can put several strings in your DATA section,
        each prepended with a header line containing the label for each. For
        example:

         __[ content1 ]__
         content for content1.
 
         __[ content2 ]__
         content
         for
         content2

        and access each string by referring to its label.

    *   Data::Section::Seekable

        This module is similar to Data::Section in letting you put several
        multipart content in DATA with the exception that it writes a table
        of content (TOC) of all parts at the beginning of DATA, e.g.:

         __DATA__
         Data::Section::Seekable v1
         part1,0,14
         part2,14,17,important
 
         This is part1
         This is part
         two

        The first paragraph after DATA is called the TOC which lists all the
        parts along with their offsets and lengths. It is therefore possible
        to locate any part just from reading the TOC instead of scanning for
        headers on the whole data. It is useful when the amount of data is
        quite large and you need quick access to random parts.

    *   Inline::Files

        This is a prior art for Data::Section but more magical (using source
        filters) and allows writing in addition to reading your parts. It
        completely replaces DATA with an unlimited number of LABEL's. I'd be
        wary in using it, and the module itself gives such warning.
