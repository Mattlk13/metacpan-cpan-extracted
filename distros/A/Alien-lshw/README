DESCRIPTION

    lshw is a small tool to provide detailed information on the hardware
    configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory configuration,
    firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache
    configuration, bus speed, etc. on DMI-capable x86 or EFI (IA-64)
    systems and on some ARM and PowerPC machines (PowerMac G4 is known to
    work).

    Information can be output in plain text, XML or HTML.

    It currently supports DMI (x86 and EFI only), OpenFirmware device tree
    (PowerPC only), PCI/AGP, ISA PnP (x86), CPUID (x86), IDE/ATA/ATAPI,
    PCMCIA (only tested on x86), USB and SCSI.
