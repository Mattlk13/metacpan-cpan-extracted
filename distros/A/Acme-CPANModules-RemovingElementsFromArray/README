NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::RemovingElementsFromArray - List of modules to help
    remove elements from array

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Acme::CPANModules::RemovingElementsFromArray (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-RemovingElementsFromArray), released on 2023-09-30.

DESCRIPTION
    Perl provides several ways to remove elements from an array. "shift"
    removes one element from the beginning, "pop" removes one element from
    the end, and "splice" removes a slice of array (and insert another list
    in its place). There's also "grep", which lets you filter a list with a
    user-supplied code. While this does not directly modify an array, you
    can simply assign the new filtered values to the array. And I might just
    as well mention array slice (@ary[1,3,4] or @ary[1..4]) which allows you
    to pick the range of elements you want by their indices.

    In addition to the above, there are also other modules which provide
    some convenience.

    Removing duplicate items

    List::Util provides "uniq" (as well as "uniqnum", "uniqint", "uniqstr")
    to remove duplicate items from a list. There's also List::Util::Uniq
    providing "dupe", "dupenum", "dupeint", and "dupestr", which return the
    duplicates instead.

    Removing overlapped items

    Array::OverlapFinder lets you find overlapping items from a series of
    arrays and optionally remove them.

    Variations of "grep"

    Some modules offer variations of "grep". For example, Array::KeepGrepped
    keeps the elements that are filtered out instead those that match the
    grep expression. List::Util::sglice offers "sglice", which removes
    elements that matches user-supplied code, except that "sglice" (like
    "splice") allows you to specify a limit to the number of elements to
    remove.

    mapslice

    List::Util::mapsplice offers "mapsplice", which removes a slice of array
    but lets you replace each element with new elements using Perl code.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n RemovingElementsFromArray

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries RemovingElementsFromArray | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=RemovingElementsFromArray -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::RemovingElementsFromArray -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::RemovingElementsFromArray::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
