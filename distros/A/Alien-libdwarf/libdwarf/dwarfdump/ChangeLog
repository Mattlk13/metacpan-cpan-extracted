    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
      Updated version string.
2020-01-05:
    * dwconf.c: Fix CoveritySan CID 206594 resource leak
      if an error reading dwarfdump.conf.
    * sanitized.c(no_questionable_chars): Fixed CoverityScan
      CID 206595. The code was
      failing to sanitize % characters: the test for %
      has been moved up a few lines.
      do_sanity_insert() had the same problem with %. Fixed.
      And do_sanity_insert() had a final line of unreachable
      code; now fixed by simplifying the code (an ASSERT
      added in a comment). Coverity Scan CID 206596.
    * print_die.c(traverse_one_die): Was failing to check
      for the normal dwarf return int and letting 
      next code deal with the fallout (and leak an error
      record). Now we check and avoid any leak or surprise.      
      Coverity Scan CID 20659
