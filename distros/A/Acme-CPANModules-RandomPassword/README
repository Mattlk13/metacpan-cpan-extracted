NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::RandomPassword - List of modules for generating
    random passwords

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::RandomPassword (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-RandomPassword), released on 2023-04-10.

DESCRIPTION
    App::genpw can generate passwords with patterns and wordlists. It loads
    secure random number generator if available. By default it generates
    12-20 character-long passwords comprising of ASCII letters and digits.
    There are several variants which are basically wrappers for convenience:
    App::genpw::base64, App::genpw::base58, App::genpw::base56,
    App::genpw::wordlist (use words from wordlists), App::genpw::ind (use
    Indonesian words). The module will use "rand()" from
    "Data::Entropy::Algorithms" if the module is available, for stronger
    random number generation.

    Crypt::GeneratePassword creates secure random pronounceable passwords.
    It provides function "word()" which generates a sequence of letters with
    vocals in between consonants so the word is still pronounceable, even
    though it's a nonsense word. It also provides "chars()" which produces a
    sequence of random letters, digits, and some symbols. It still uses
    "rand()" by default which is not cryptographically secure.

    Crypt::RandPasswd implements the old FIPS 181 (1993, withdrawn 2015)
    standard to generate pronounceable password, which is no longer
    recommended.

    Crypt::PassGen, yet another module to create random words that look like
    real words. It does not use a secure random number generator by default.

    Data::SimplePassword

    String::MkPasswd

    Data::Random::String and Data::Random.

    Text::Password::Pronounceable::RandomCase

    String::Random

    String::Urandom

    Crypt::XkcdPassword, a password generator module inspired by
    <http://xkcd.com/936/>.

    CtrlO::Crypt::XkcdPassword, another password generator module inspired
    by <http://xkcd.com/936/>.

    App::GenPass

    Crypt::PW44

    Crypt::YAPassGen

    Session::Token

    Text::Password::Pronounceable

    For other types of random data, see other lists mentioned in the See
    Also section.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n RandomPassword

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries RandomPassword | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=RandomPassword -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::RandomPassword -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::RandomPassword::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
