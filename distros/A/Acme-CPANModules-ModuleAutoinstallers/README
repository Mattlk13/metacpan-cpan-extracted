NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ModuleAutoinstallers - Modules that autoinstalls
    other modules during run-time

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ModuleAutoinstallers (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ModuleAutoinstallers), released on 2020-02-06.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that autoinstalls other modules during run-time.

    These "module autoinstallers" modules can automatically install missing
    module during run-time using one of installers (usually "cpanm" a.k.a.
    App::cpanminus). Convenient when running a Perl script (that comes
    without a proper distribution or "cpanfile") that uses several modules
    which you might not have. The alternative to lib::xi is the "trial and
    error" method: repeatedly run the Perl script to see which module it
    tries and fails to load.

    They work by installing a hook in @INC. Read more about require hooks in
    "perlfunc" under the "require" function.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   lib::xi

    *   Module::AutoINC

    *   Require::Hook::More

FAQ
  What are ways to use this module?
    Aside from reading it, you can install all the listed modules using
    cpanmodules:

        % cpanmodules ls-entries ModuleAutoinstallers | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=ModuleAutoinstallers -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful result for "lcpan
    related-mods" when it comes to finding related modules for the modules
    listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
