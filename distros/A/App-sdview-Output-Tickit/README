NAME

    App::sdview::Output::Tickit - interactive terminal-based viewer for
    App::sdview

SYNOPSIS

       $ sdview README.pod -o tickit

    (though this is likely the default output mode if this module is
    installed)

DESCRIPTION

    This output module provides an interactive terminal-viewer for
    rendering documents in App::sdview, showing formatted information on
    the terminal. It uses Tickit to provide the terminal interactions.

 Keybindings

      * PageDown - scroll down half a page

      * Space - scroll down a page

      * End - scroll to bottom

      * F9 - open the outline view popup. See Below.

      * / - start a regexp search in the document body. See Below.

      * q - exit

 Outline View

    The outline view displays an overview of all the section headings in
    the document.

    Within the outline view, the mouse wheel will scroll the list, and
    clicking an entry will jump directly to it, dismissing the view.

    Typing text with the outline view open will filter it to just those
    headings matching the typed text. Pressing the <Enter> key will jump
    directly to the first highlighted heading, again dismissing the view.

 Regexp Searching

    Typing into the main search box enters text that forms a (perl) regexp
    pattern to be tested against the body text of the document. Each
    paragraph is tested individually and all matches are highlighted.
    Pressing <Enter> will select the first match. Use the <n> and <p> keys
    to jump between them. Press <Escape> to clear the highlights. Press
    <Alt-i> to toggle case-insensitivity.

TODO

      * Line-editing and history in the / search entry box.

      * Follow links, possibly internally implementing a history mechanism
      or multiple pages.
