NAME
    App::DesktopOpenUtils - Utilities related to Desktop::Open

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::DesktopOpenUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-DesktopOpenUtils), released on 2021-08-01.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities:

    #INSERT_EXECS_LIST

FUNCTIONS
  open_desktop
    Usage:

     open_desktop(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   paths_or_urls* => *array[str]*

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
