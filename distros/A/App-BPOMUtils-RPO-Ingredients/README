VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of
    App::BPOMUtils::RPO::Ingredients (from Perl distribution
    App-BPOMUtils-RPO-Ingredients), released on 2024-02-26.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes CLI utilities related to helping with
    Processed Food Registration (RPO - Registrasi Pangan Olahan),
    particularly with regards to ingredients.

    *   bpom-rpo-ingredients-group-for-label

FUNCTIONS
  bpom_rpo_ingredients_group_for_label
    Usage:

     bpom_rpo_ingredients_group_for_label(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Group ingredients suitable for food label.

    This utility accepts a CSV data from stdin. The CSV must be formatted
    like this:

     Ingredient,%weight,"Ingredient name for label (Indonesian)","Ingredient name for label (English)","QUID?","Note (Indonesian)","Note (English)","Ingredient group for label (Indonesian)","Ingredient group for label (English)"
     Air,78.48,Air,Water,,
     Gula,16.00,Gula,Sugar,,"mengandung pengawet sulfit","contains sulfite preservative",
     "Nata de coco",5.00,"Nata de coco","Nata de coco",1,"mengandung pengawet sulfit","contains sulfit preservative",
     "Asam sitrat",0.25,"Asam sitrat","Citric acid",,,,"Pengatur keasaman","Acidity regulator"
     "Asam malat",0.10,"Asam malat","Malic acid",,,,"Pengatur keasaman","Acidity regulator"
     "Grape flavor",0.10,Anggur,Grape,,,,"Perisa sintetik","Synthetic flavoring"
     "Tea flavor",0.05,Teh,Tea,,,,"Perisa sintetik","Synthetic flavoring"
     "Natrium benzoat",0.02,"Natrium benzoat","Sodium benzoate",,,,Pengawet,Preservative

    It can then group the ingredients based on the ingredient group and
    generate this (for Indonesian, "--lang ind"):

     Ingredient,%weight
     Air,78.48
     Gula (mengandung pengawet sulfit),16.00
     "Nata de coco 5% (mengandung pengawet sulfit)",5.00
     "Pengatur keasaman (Asam sitrat, Asam malat)",0.35
     "Perisa sintetik (Anggur, Teh)",0.15
     "Pengawet Natrium benzoat",0.02

    And for English, "--lang eng":

     Ingredient,%weight
     Water,78.48
     Sugar (contains sulfite preservative),16.00
     "Nata de coco 5% (contains sulfite preservative)",5.00
     "Acidity regulator (Citric acid, Malic acid)",0.35
     "Synthetic flavoring (Grape, Tea)",0.15
     "Preservative Sodium benzoate",0.02

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   lang => *str* (default: "ind")

        (No description)

    *   quid_precision => *uint* (default: 4)

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
