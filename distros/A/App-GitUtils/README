FAQ
  What is the purpose of this distribution? Haven't other similar utilities existed?
    For example, mpath from Module::Path distribution is similar to pmpath
    in App::PMUtils, and mversion from Module::Version distribution is
    similar to pmversion from App::PMUtils distribution, and so on.

    True. The main point of these utilities is shell tab completion, to save
    typing.
