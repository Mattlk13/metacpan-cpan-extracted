NAME
    App::GitUtils - Day-to-day command-line utilities for git

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.085 of App::GitUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-GitUtils), released on 2022-03-20.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   gu

    *   this-repo

    These utilities provide some shortcuts and tab completion to make it
    more convenient when working with git con the command-line.

FUNCTIONS
  clone_to_bare
    Usage:

     clone_to_bare(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Clone repository to a bare repository.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dir => *dirname*

        A directory inside git repo.

        If not specified, will assume current directory is inside git
        repository and will search ".git" upwards.

    *   target_dir => *dirname*

        Target repo directory.

        If not specified, defaults to "$repodir.bare/".

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  info
    Usage:

     info(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Return information about git repository.

    Information include: - Path of the git directory - Repository name -
    Current/active branch

    Will return status 412 if working directory is not inside a git
    repository. Will return status 500 on errors, e.g. if "git" command
    cannot recognize the repository.

    This function is not exported.

    *   dir => *dirname*

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
