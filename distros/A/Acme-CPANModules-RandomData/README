NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::RandomData - List of modules for generating random
    (fake, mock) data

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Acme::CPANModules::RandomData
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-RandomData), released on
    2023-04-10.

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Random generates random number, random generated word, random
    dictionary word (default wordlist provided), date (in YYYY-MM-DD
    format), time (in HH::MM:SS format), datetime, image (just a blank PNG
    with random size and background color).

    Data::Maker can generate realistic fake data including IP address,
    email, password, person (first name, middle name, last name, SSN). It
    focuses on performance (200 records/sec number is cited).

    Data::Faker is yet another moduxsle, with plugins to generate company
    name, person name, date/time, phone number, street address,
    domain/IP/email/username.

    Mock::Data can generate several types of mock data including number,
    UUID, IP/hostname/email, date/time, text.

    Mock::Populate in non-plugin-based, can generate random image, string,
    name, date/time.

    Faker is another plugin-based random data generator. The included
    plugins can generate random street address, color, company name, company
    jargon/tagline, buzzwords, IP address, email address, domain name, text
    ("lorem ipsum ..."), credit card number, phone number, software name,
    username. However, some plugins are currently empty. The name plugin
    contains 3007 first names and 474 last names (probably copied from
    Data::Faker). There is no option to pick male/female names.

    Other: Text::Lorem.

    For more specific types of random data (person, password, etc), see
    other lists mentioned in the See Also section.

    Keywords: random data, fake data, mock data.

    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n RandomData

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries RandomData | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=RandomData -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::RandomData -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::RandomData::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
