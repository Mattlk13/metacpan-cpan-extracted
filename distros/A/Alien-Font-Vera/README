NAME
    Alien::Font::Vera - Access to Vera truetype file

SYNOPSIS
        use Alien::Font::Vera;
    
        my $path = Alien::Font::Vera::path;

DESCRIPTION
    This module was created as an optional dependency of Project2::Gantt to
    have access to a ttf font file.

    Thus only the .ttf file is provided since this is what Imager can read.

    Distros might redirect to pre-existing resources.

FONT
    Vera font is provided using the Bitstream license (share/License.txt)
    also present in this package.
