=head1 NAME

mtputils-del-files - Delete multiple files from MTP (wrapper for mtp-delfile)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.03 of mtputils-del-files (from Perl distribution App-MTPUtils), released on 2015-11-07.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % mtputils-del-files [options] <files>...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine is a thin wrapper for C<mtp-delfile> command from C<mtp-tools>.

To use this routine, you must already run C<mtp-files> and save its output in
C<mtp-files.out> file, e.g.:

 % mtp-files > mtp-files.out

This file is used for tab completion as well as getting filename/ID when only
one is specified. This makes using C<mtp-delfile> less painful.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Set log level to debug (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use DEBUG=1).

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging).

=item B<--quiet>

Set log level to quiet (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use QUIET=1).

=item B<--trace>

Set log level to trace (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use TRACE=1).

=item B<--verbose>

Set log level to info (note: you also need to set LOG=1 to enable logging, or use VERBOSE=1).

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--file>=I<s@>*

Filename/ID/wildcard.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--files-json>=I<s>

Filenames/IDs/wildcards (JSON-encoded).

See C<--file>.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C mtputils-del-files mtputils-del-files

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete mtputils-del-files 'p/*/`mtputils-del-files`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 MTPUTILS_DEL_FILES_OPT => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/mtputils-del-files.conf>, C<~/mtputils-del-files.conf> or C</etc/mtputils-del-files.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 files (see --file)
 format (see --format)
 log_level (see --log-level)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)

=head1 FILES

~/.config/mtputils-del-files.conf

~/mtputils-del-files.conf

/etc/mtputils-del-files.conf
