NAME
    App::MTPUtils - CLI utilities related to MTP (Media Transfer Protocol)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of App::MTPUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-MTPUtils), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution includes the following CLI utilities:

    Currently these utilities are just some wrappers/helpers for the "mtp-*"
    CLI utilities distributed in "mtp-tools".

FUNCTIONS
  delete_files
    Usage:

     delete_files(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Delete multiple files from MTP (wrapper for mtp-delfile).

    This routine is a thin wrapper for "mtp-delfile" command from
    "mtp-tools".

    To use this routine, you must already run "mtp-files" and save its
    output in "mtp-files.out" file, e.g.:

     % mtp-files > mtp-files.out

    This file is used for tab completion as well as getting filename/ID when
    only one is specified. This makes using "mtp-delfile" less painful.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   files* => *array[str]*

        Filenames/IDs/wildcards.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  get_files
    Usage:

     get_files(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Get multiple files from MTP (wrapper for mtp-getfile).

    This routine is a thin wrapper for "mtp-file" command from "mtp-tools".

    To use this routine, you must already run "mtp-files" and save its
    output in "mtp-files.out" file, e.g.:

     % mtp-files > mtp-files.out

    This file is used for tab completion as well as getting filename/ID when
    only one is specified. This makes using "mtp-getfile" less painful.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   files* => *array[str]*

        Filenames/IDs/wildcards.

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  list_files
    Usage:

     list_files(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    List files contained in mtp-files.out.

    This routine will present information in "mtp-files.out" in a more
    readable way, like the Unix "ls" command.

    To use this routine, you must already run "mtp-files" and save its
    output in "mtp-files.out" file, e.g.:

     % mtp-files > mtp-files.out

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   queries => *array[str]*

        Filenames/wildcards.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
