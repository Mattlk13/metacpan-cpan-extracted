NAME
    App::DiffTarballs - Diff contents of two tarballs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::DiffTarballs (from Perl
    distribution App-DiffTarballs), released on 2021-05-09.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script diff-tarballs.

FUNCTIONS
  diff_tarballs
    Usage:

     diff_tarballs(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Diff contents of two tarballs.

    Examples:

    *   Show diff between two Perl releases:

         diff_tarballs(
             tarball1 => "My-Dist-1.001.tar.gz",
           tarball2 => "My-Dist-1.002.tar.bz2"
         );

    This utility extracts the two tarballs to temporary directories and then
    perform "diff -ruN" against the two. It deletes the temporary
    directories afterwards.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   tarball1* => *filename*

    *   tarball2* => *filename*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  DEBUG
    Bool. If set to true, will cause temporary directories to not being
    cleaned up after the program is done.

  DIFF
    String. Set diff command to use. Defaults to "diff -ruN". For example,
    you can set it to "diff --color -ruN" ("--color" requires GNU diff 3.4
    or later), or "colordiff -ruN".

  NO_COLOR
    If set (and "DIFF" is not set), will add "--color=never" option to diff
    command.

  COLOR => bool
    If set to true (and "DIFF" is not set), will add "--color=always" option
    to diff command.

    If set to false (and "DIFF" is not set), will add "--color=never" option
    to diff command.

    Note that "NO_COLOR" takes precedence.
