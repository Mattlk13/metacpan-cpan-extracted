NAME
    Array::Util::Shuffle - Shuffle an array

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Array::Util::Shuffle (from Perl
    distribution Array-Util-Shuffle), released on 2022-07-02.

SYNOPSIS
     use Array::Util::Shuffle qw(shuffle);

     my @myarray = (1..10);
     my @shuffled = shuffle(\@myarray);

     # shuffle inplace
     shuffle(\@myarray, {inplace=>1});

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides "shuffle()" to shuffle an array using the standard
    Fisher-Yates algorithm, like that implemented in List::Util or
    List::MoreUtils. It accepts an arrayref instead of a list and can be
    instructed to shuffle the array in-place. There will be more options
    provided in the future.

FUNCTIONS
  shuffle
    Shuffle an array.

    Usage:

     shuffle(\@ary [ , \%opts ]);

    Given an array reference ("\@ary"), will return the shuffled list.

    Options:

    *   inplace

        Bool. If set to true, will modify the array in-place and return the
        array reference, instead of returning the shuffled list.

SEE ALSO
    The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm described by Durstenfeld, 1964.

    Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle, Array::Shuffle, and a few others like
    List::MoreUtils::PP's "samples" do the same thing.

    Modules that provide a random-sampling-without-replacement function can
    also be used to shuffle. Shuffling is basically random total sampling.
    These modules include List::Util ("sample"), List::MoreUtils (samples),
    Array::Sample::SimpleRandom.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
