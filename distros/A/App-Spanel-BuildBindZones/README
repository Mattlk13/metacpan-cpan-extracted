VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::Spanel::BuildBindZones
    (from Perl distribution App-Spanel-BuildBindZones), released on

SYNOPSIS
    See the included spanel-build-bind-zones script.

FUNCTIONS
  build_bind_zones
    Usage:

     build_bind_zones(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Build BIND zones from YAML zones.

    This script will collect all YAML zones from user accounts
    (/u/*/sysetc/zone=*) and build BIND zones then write them to the current
    directory with names db.* (so /u/foo/sysetc/zone=example.com will become
    ./db.example.com).

    Will not override existing files unless "--overwrite" ("-O") is
    specified.

    Will skip YAML zones that contain invalid data, e.g. name in record that
    contains underscore ("_"), unknown record type, etc.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   overwrite => *bool*

        Whether to overwrite existing output files.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
