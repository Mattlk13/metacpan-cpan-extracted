=head1 NAME

cpanmodules - The Acme::CPANModules CLI

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.007 of cpanmodules (from Perl distribution App-cpanmodules), released on 2023-06-17.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Install some C<Acme::CPANModules::> modules and then ...

List all installed Acme::CPANModules modules:

 % cpanmodules ls
 % cpanmodules ls -l

Find Acme::CPANModules modules that mention a module:

 % cpanmodules ls --mentions Foo::Bar

View as rendered POD:

 % cpanmodules view PERLANCAR::Favorites

Get the list (raw):

 % cpanmodules get PERLANCAR::Favorites

List entries of a list:

 % cpanmodules ls-entries PERLANCAR::Favorites::App
 App::lcpan
 App::pause
 App::SetScreensaverTimeout

Install all entries of a list:

 % cpanmodules ls-entries PERLANCAR::Favorites::App | cpanm -n

=head1 SUBCOMMANDS

=head2 B<get>

Get contents of an Acme::CPANModules module.

=head2 B<ls>

List all installed Acme::CPANModules modules.

=head2 B<ls-entries>

List entries from an Acme::CPANModules module.

=head2 B<view>

View an Acme::CPANModules module as rendered POD.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Common options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

Can actually be specified multiple times to instruct application to read from
multiple configuration files (and merge them).


=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

A single configuration file can contain profiles, i.e. alternative sets of
values that can be selected. For example:

 [profile=dev]
 username=foo
 pass=beaver
 
 [profile=production]
 username=bar
 pass=honey

When you specify C<--config-profile=dev>, C<username> will be set to C<foo> and
C<password> to C<beaver>. When you specify C<--config-profile=production>,
C<username> will be set to C<bar> and C<password> to C<honey>.


=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

If you specify C<--no-config>, the application will not read any configuration
file.


=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

If you specify C<--no-env>, the application wil not read any environment
variable.


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--subcommands>

List available subcommands.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C cpanmodules cpanmodules

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete cpanmodules 'p/*/`cpanmodules`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F</home/u1/.config/cpanmodules.conf>, F</home/u1/cpanmodules.conf>, or F</etc/cpanmodules.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

To put configuration for a certain subcommand only, use a section name like C<[subcommand=NAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=NAME]>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

You can also filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable equals some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable includes some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not include some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

To load and configure plugins, you can use either the C<-plugins> parameter (e.g. C<< -plugins=DumpArgs >> or C<< -plugins=DumpArgs@before_validate_args >>), or use the C<[plugin=NAME ...]> sections, for example:

 [plugin=DumpArgs]
 -event=before_validate_args
 -prio=99
 
 [plugin=Foo]
 -event=after_validate_args
 arg1=val1
 arg2=val2

 

which is equivalent to setting C<< -plugins=-DumpArgs@before_validate_args@99,-Foo@after_validate_args,arg1,val1,arg2,val2 >>.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-cpanmodules>
