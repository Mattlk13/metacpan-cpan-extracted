# General

I am always open to improvements and suggestions. Use issues at
https://github.com/Tux/speedtest/issues

# Style

I will never accept pull request that do not strictly conform to my
style, however you might hate it. You can read the reasoning behind
my preferences here: http://tux.nl/style.html

I really don not care about mixed spaces and tabs in (leading) whitespace

# Requirements

Currently, the script is simple enough to require perl-5.10.0. It
would probably also run fine under 5.8.x if I were not to use "say".
I got lazy and used to that. I test with very recent versions of perl.
