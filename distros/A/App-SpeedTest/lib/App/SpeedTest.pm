=head1 NAME

App::SpeedTest - Command-line interface to speedtest.net

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ speedtest [ --no-geo | --country=NL ] [ --list | --ping ] [ options ]

 $ speedtest --list
 $ speedtest --ping --country=BE
 $ speedtest
 $ speedtest -s 4358
 $ speedtest --url=http://ookla.extraip.net
 $ speedtest -q --no-download
 $ speedtest -Q --no-upload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The provided perl script is a command-line interface to the
L<speedtest.net|http://www.speedtest.net/> infrastructure so that
flash is not required

It was written to feature the functionality that speedtest.net offers
without the overhead of flash or java and the need of a browser.

=head1 Raison-d'Ãªtre

The tool is there to give you a quick indication of the achievable
throughput of your current network. That can drop dramatically if
you are behind (several) firewalls or badly configured networks (or
network parts like switches, hubs and routers).

It was inspired by L<speedtest-cli|https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli>,
a project written in python. But I neither like python, nor did I like the
default behavior of that script. I also think it does not take the right
decisions in choosing the server based on distance instead of speed. That
B<does> matter if one has fiber lines. I prefer speed over distance.

=head1 Command-line Arguments
X<CLIA>

=over 2

=item -? | --help
X<-?>
X<--help>

Show all available options and then exit.

=item -V | --version
X<-V>
X<--version>

Show program version and exit.

=item --man
X<--man>

Show the builtin manual using C<pod2man> and C<nroff>.

=item --info
X<--info>

Show the builtin manual using C<pod2text>.

=item -v[#] | --verbose[=#]
X<-v>
X<--version>

Set verbose level. Default value is 1. A plain -v without value will set
the level to 2.

=item --simple
X<--simple>

An alias for C<-v0>

=item --all
X<--all>

No (default) filtering on available servers. Useful when finding servers
outside of the country of your own location.

=item -g | --geo
X<-g>
X<--geo>

Use GEO-IP service to find the country your ISP is located. The default
is true. If disable (C<--no-geo>), the server to use will be based on
distance instead of on latency.

=item -cXX | --cc=XX | --country=XX
X<-c>
X<--cc>
X<--country>

Pass the ISO country code to select the servers

 $ speedtest -c NL ...
 $ speedtest --cc=B ...
 $ speedtest --country=D ...

=item --list-cc
X<--list-cc>

Fetch the server list and then show the list of countries the servers are
located with their country code and server count

 $ speedtest --list-cc
 AD Andorra                             1
 AE United Arab Emirates                4
 :
 ZW Zimbabwe                            6

You can then use that code to list the servers in the chosen country, as
described below.

=item -l | --list
X<-l>
X<--list>

This option will show all servers in the selection with the distance in
kilometers to the server.

 $ speedtest --list --country=IS
   1: 10661 - Tengir hf              Akureyri    1980.02 km

=item -p | --ping | --ping=40
X<-p>
X<--ping>

Show a list of servers in the selection with their latency in ms.
Be very patient if running this with L</--all>.

 $ speedtest --ping --cc=BE

  12: 30594 - Orange Belgium       Evere            169.29 km     150 ms

If a server does not respond, a very high latency is used as default.

This option only shows the 40 nearest servers. The number can be changed
as optional argument.

 - The server ID
 - The latency in ms
 - The number of tests executed in this measurement
 - The direction of the test (D = Down, U = Up)
 - The measure avarage speed in Mbit/s
 - The minimum speed measured in one of the test in Mbit/s
 - The maximum speed measured in one of the test in Mbit/s

Don't run the full test. The default test runs 40 tests, sorting on

too long on slow connections without adding value. The default value
for C<-q> is 20 but any value between 1 and 40 is allowed.

Don't run the full test. The default test runs 40 tests, sorting on

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

...

=head1 BUGS and CAVEATS

Due to language implementation, it may report speeds that are not
consistent with the speeds reported by the web interface or other
speed-test tools.  Likewise for reported latencies, which are not
to be compared to those reported by tools like ping.

=item Improve documentation

What did I miss?

XML::Simple is not the recommended XML parser, but it sufficed on
startup. All other API's are more complex.

=head1 PORTABILITY

As Perl has been ported to a plethora of operating systems, this CLI
will work fine on all systems that fulfill the requirement as listed
in Makefile.PL (or the various META files).

The script has been tested on Linux, HP-UX, AIX, and Windows 7.

Debian wheezy will run with just two additional packages:

 # apt-get install libxml-simple-perl libdata-peek-perl

This tool is by no means a guarantee to show the correc6t speeds. It
