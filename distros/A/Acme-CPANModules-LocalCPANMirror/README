NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANMirror - List of modules/tools to create a
    local CPAN mirror

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANMirror (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-LocalCPANMirror), released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    Since CPAN repository is just a hierarchy of files, you can simply use a
    recursive download/mirror tool over http/https/ftp. However, for
    additional features you can take a look at the modules in this list.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    CPAN::Mini
        Author: RJBS <https://metacpan.org/author/RJBS>

        This module lets you create a so-called "mini mirror", which only
        contains the newest release for each distribution (where CPAN might
        also contains previous versions of a distribution as long as the
        CPAN author does not clean up his previous releases). This produces
        a significantly smaller CPAN mirror which you can use on your
        PC/laptop for offline development use.

    App::lcpan
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        This application not only lets you download a CPAN mini mirror
        (using CPAN::Mini actually) but also index the package list and
        distribution metadata into a SQLite database so you can perform
        various queries, like list of modules/distributions/scripts of a
        CPAN author, or related modules using cross-mention information on
        modules' PODs, or various rankings.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
