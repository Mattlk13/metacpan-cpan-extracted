NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANMirror - Creating a local CPAN mirror

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANMirror (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-LocalCPANMirror), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Creating a local CPAN mirror.

    Since CPAN repository is just a hierarchy of files, you can simply use a
    recursive download/mirror tool over http/https/ftp. However, for
    additional features you can take a look at the modules in this list.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   CPAN::Mini

        This module lets you create a so-called "mini mirror", which only
        contains the newest release for each distribution (where CPAN might
        also contains previous versions of a distribution as long as the
        CPAN author does not clean up his previous releases). This produces
        a significantly smaller CPAN mirror which you can use on your
        PC/laptop for offline development use.

    *   App::lcpan

        This application not only lets you download a CPAN mini mirror
        (using CPAN::Mini actually) but also index the package list and
        distribution metadata into a SQLite database so you can perform
        various queries, like list of modules/distributions/scripts of a
        CPAN author, or related modules using cross-mention information on
        modules' PODs, or various rankings.
