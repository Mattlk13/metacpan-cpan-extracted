NAME
    App::dateseq::idn - Like dateseq, but with built-in support for
    Indonesian holidays

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::dateseq::idn (from Perl
    distribution App-dateseq-idn), released on 2021-03-09.

FUNCTIONS
  dateseq_idn
    Usage:

     dateseq_idn(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Like dateseq, but with built-in support for Indonesian holidays.

    This utility is a wrapper for dateseq, with builtin support for
    Indonesian holidays (data from Calendar::Indonesia::Holiday). It offers
    additional --holiday (and --noholiday, as well as -j) options to let you
    filter dates based on whether they are Indonesian holidays.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   business => *bool*

        Only list business days (Mon-Fri), or non-business days.

    *   business6 => *bool*

        Only list business days (Mon-Sat), or non-business days.

    *   exclude_dow => *date::dow_nums*

        Do not show dates with these day-of-weeks.

    *   exclude_month => *date::month_nums*

        Do not show dates with these month numbers.

    *   format_class => *perl::modname*

        Use a DateTime::Format::* class for formatting.

        By default, DateTime::Format::Strptime is used with pattern set from
        the <strftime> option.

    *   format_class_attrs => *hash*

        Arguments to pass to constructor of DateTime::Format::* class.

    *   from => *date*

        Starting date.

    *   header => *str*

        Add a header row.

    *   holiday => *bool*

        Only list holidays (or non-holidays).

    *   include_dow => *date::dow_nums*

        Only show dates with these day-of-weeks.

    *   include_joint_leave => *bool*

        Whether to assume joint leave days as holidays.

    *   include_month => *date::month_nums*

        Only show dates with these month numbers.

    *   increment => *duration*

    *   limit => *posint*

        Only generate a certain amount of numbers.

    *   limit_monthly => *posint*

        Only output at most this number of dates for each month.

    *   limit_yearly => *posint*

        Only output at most this number of dates for each year.

    *   reverse => *true*

        Decrement instead of increment.

    *   strftime => *str*

        strftime() format for each date.

        Default is "%Y-%m-%d", unless when hour/minute/second is specified,
        then it is "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S".

        "dateseq" actually uses DateTimeX::strftimeq, so you can embed Perl
        code for flexibility. For example:

         % dateseq 2019-11-19 2019-11-25 -f '%Y-%m-%d%( $_->day_of_week == 7 ? "su" : "" )q'

        will print something like:

         2019-11-19
         2019-11-20
         2019-11-21
         2019-11-22
         2019-11-23
         2019-11-24su
         2019-11-25

    *   to => *date*

        End date, if not specified will generate an infinite* stream of
        dates.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
