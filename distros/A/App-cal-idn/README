NAME
    App::cal::idn - Display Indonesian calendar on the command-line

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.137 of App::cal::idn (from Perl

SYNOPSIS
     # See cal-idn script provided in this distribution

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the cal-idn command to display Indonesian calendar
    on the command-line.

FUNCTIONS
  gen_calendar
    Usage:

     gen_calendar(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate one or more monthly calendars in 3-column format.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   highlight_today => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   month => *int*

        The first month.

        Not required if months=12 (generate whole year from month 1 to 12).

    *   months => *int* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   show_holiday_list => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   show_joint_leave => *bool* (default: 0)

        (No description)

    *   time_zone => *str*

        (No description)

    *   year* => *int*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  gen_monthly_calendar
    Usage:

     gen_monthly_calendar(%args) -> any

    Generate a single month calendar.

    Return [\@lines, \@hol]

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
