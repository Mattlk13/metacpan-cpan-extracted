NAME
    App::ppll - Command runner

VERSION
    0.0.1

DESCRIPTION
    "ppll" is a tool to control the execution of commands. It can run
    commands in parallel, construct commands from lists of parameters, and
    more.

    It handles the output of commands and can prefix lines with which
    command produced it, print timestamps, etc.

    "ppll" has functionality similar to "xargs" and "parallel".

    This page documents "ppll"â€™s Perl API. For user documentation of the
    "ppll" command see ppll.

SYNOPSIS
        my $ppll = App::ppll->new( %args );
        $ppll->call();

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  "call"
    Runs "ppll".

    Returns an integer suitable for "exit" (0 if everything went fine, non-0
    otherwise).

  "new( %args )"
    Constucts a new "App::ppll" object that represents an invocation of
    "ppll". Does *not* run anything, to do that use call.

   NAMED ARGUMENTS
    "argv"
        An array ref to use instead of @ARGV.
