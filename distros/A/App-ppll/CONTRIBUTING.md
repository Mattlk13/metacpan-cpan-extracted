# Contributing to ppll

`ppll` is a free and open source software project, so contributions are welcome
by default.

Please discuss all changes in [issues] or merge requests.

All changes to this project are handled in [GitLab]. Bug reports and feature
requests should be reported as [issues].

If youâ€™d like to contribute with code, e.g. a bug fix or new feature, please
open a merge request.

The maintainers reserve the rights to reject or modify all contributions.

And lastly, if you have contributed something but no-one thanked you, thatâ€™s a
bug. ðŸ˜‰ So thanks in advance! ðŸ–¤

## Guidelines

Please update all affected documentation in the same merge request (but not
_necessarily_ the same commit) as the code changes.

All code should be formatted using Perl::Tidy and the `.perltidyrc` file in the
repository, and cause no Perl::Critic errors (the pipelines will test this).
