NAME
    App::PhysicsUnitUtils - Utilities related to Physics::Unit

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::PhysicsUnitUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-PhysicsUnitUtils), released on 2020-04-04.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   convert-unit

FUNCTIONS
  convert_unit
    Usage:

     convert_unit(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Convert a physical quantity from one unit to another.

    Examples:

    *   Show all possible conversions for speed:

         convert_unit(quantity => "m/s");

        Result:

         [
           { amount => 3.33564095198152e-09, unit => "c" },
           { amount => 3.28083989501312, unit => "fps" },
           { amount => 3600000000000, unit => "knot" },
           { amount => 3600000000000, unit => "knots" },
           { amount => 3.6, unit => "kph" },
           { amount => 0.001, unit => "kps" },
           { amount => 2.2369362920544, unit => "mph" },
           { amount => 1, unit => "mps" },
           { amount => 3.33564095198152e-09, unit => "speed-of-light" },
         ]

    *   Convert from meters/sec to kilometers/hour:

         convert_unit(quantity => "40 m/s", to_unit => "kph"); # -> 144

    If target unit is not specified, will show all known conversions.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quantity* => *str*

    *   to_unit => *physical::unit*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third

    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
