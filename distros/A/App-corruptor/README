FUNCTIONS
  corruptor
    Usage:

     corruptor(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Corrupt files by writing random bytes/blocks to them.

    Examples:

    *   Corrupt two files by writing 1% random bytes:

         corruptor( files => ["disk.img", "disk2.img"], proportion => "1%");

    This utility can be used in disk/filesystem testing. It corrupts files
    by writing random bytes/blocks to them.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

    *   proportion* => *percent*

        How much random data is written as proportion of file size (in
        percent).

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code
    (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
    ($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is
    200. Third element ($payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
    element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
    that contains extra information.

    Return value: (any)
