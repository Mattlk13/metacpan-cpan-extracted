NAME
    Alien::SVN - A wrapper for installing the SVN Perl bindings

DESCRIPTION
    Alien::SVN is a wrapper to install the Perl bindings for subversion,
    also known as SVN::Core. If your module needs SVN::Core it can depend on
    SVN::Core normally, then CPAN clients can resolve the dependency
    normally via Alien::SVN. This is particularly useful for programs like
    SVK.

    It comes with a copy of Subversion 1.8.11 which it will compile but only
    installs the Perl and Subversion libraries. They will be installed to
    your Perl library, not your system library. The subversion binaries will
    not be installed.

BUGS and FEEDBACK
    Alien::SVN only wraps SVN::Core. We don't work on it.

    Bug reports, problems and feedback about the Alien::SVN distribution and
    building SVN::Core should come to us at
    <https://github.com/evalEmpire/Alien-SVN/issues>.

    Issues and improvements to SVN::Core should go to the Apache Subversion
    project directly. <https://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html>

    If you're not sure who to report to, you can always report to us and
    we'll point you in the right direction.

    Report early, report often.
