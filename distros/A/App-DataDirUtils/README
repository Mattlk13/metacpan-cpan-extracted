NAME
    App::DataDirUtils - (DEPRECATED) CLI utilities related to datadirs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::DataDirUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-DataDirUtils), released on 2021-08-23.

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    This distribution is deprecated in favor of the more general
    App::TaggedDirUtils.

SYNOPSIS
    See CLIs included in this distribution.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to datadirs:

    *   list-datadirs

    A "datadir" is a directory which has a (usually empty) file called
    .tag-datadir. A datadir usually does not contain other datadirs.

    You can backup, rsync, or do whatever you like with a datadir, just like
    a normal filesystem directory. The utilities provided in this
    distribution help you handle datadirs.

FUNCTIONS
  list_datadirs
    Usage:

     list_datadirs(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Search datadirs recursively in a list of directory names.

    Note: when a datadir is found, its contents are no longer recursed to
    search for other datadirs.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   prefixes* => *array[dirname]*

        Locations to find datadirs.

        Directory name(s) to search for "datadirs", i.e. directories which
        have ".tag-datadir" file in its root.

    *   skip_git => *bool* (default: 1)

        Do not recurse into .git directory.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

FAQ
  Why datadir?
    With tagged directories, you can put them in various places and not just
    on a single parent directory. For example:

     media/
       2020/
         media-2020a/ -> a datadir
         media-2020b/ -> a datadir
       2021/
         media-2021a/ -> a datadir
       etc/
         foo -> a datadir
         others/
           bar/ -> a datadir

    As an alternative, you can also create symlinks:

     all-media/
       media-2020a -> symlink to ../media/2020/media-2020a
       media-2020b -> symlink to ../media/2020/media-2020b
       media-2021a -> symlink to ../media/2021/media-2021a
       media-2021b -> symlink to ../media/2021/media-2021b
       foo -> symlink to ../media/etc/foo
       bar -> symlink to ../media/etc/others/bar

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
