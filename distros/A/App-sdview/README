NAME

    App::sdview - a terminal document viewer for POD and other syntaxes

SYNOPSIS

       use App::sdview;
    
       exit App::sdview->new->run( "some-file.pod" );

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements a terminal-based program for viewing structured
    documents. It currently understands POD, some simple Markdown
    formatting, and a basic understanding of nroff (for manpages). Future
    versions may expand on these abilities, extending them or adding new
    formats.

    To actually use it, you likely wanted wanted to see the bin/sdview
    script.

TODO

      * Add more formats. ReST perhaps. Maybe others too.

      * Improved Markdown parser. Currently the parser is very simple.

      * Other outputs. Consider a Tickit-based frontend.

      Also more structured file writers - ReST and maybe also HTML output.
