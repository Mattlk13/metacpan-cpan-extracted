NAME

    App::sdview - a terminal document viewer for POD and other syntaxes

SYNOPSIS

       use App::sdview;
    
       exit App::sdview->new->run( "some-file.pod" );

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements a terminal-based program for viewing structured
    documents. It currently understands POD and some simple Markdown
    formatting, though future versions are expected to handle nroff (for
    manpages) and other styles.

    To actually use it, you likely wanted wanted to see the bin/sdview
    script.

TODO

      * Add more formats. ReST perhaps. Maybe others too.

      * Improved Markdown parser. Currently the parser is very simple.

      * Other outputs. Consider a Tickit-based frontend.

      Also more structured file writers - ReST and maybe also HTML output.
