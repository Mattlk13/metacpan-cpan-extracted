NAME

    App::sdview - a terminal document viewer for POD and other syntaxes

SYNOPSIS

       use App::sdview;
    
       exit App::sdview->new->run( "some-file.pod" );

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements a terminal-based program for viewing structured
    documents. It currently understands POD and some simple Markdown
    formatting, though future versions are expected to handle nroff (for
    manpages) and other styles.

    To actually use it, you likely wanted wanted to see the bin/sdview
    script.

TODO

      * Add more formats. nroff and ReST at least. Perhaps others.

      * Improved Markdown parser. Currently the parser is very simple.

      * Other outputs. Consider a Tickit-based frontend. Also some
      structured file writers - allowing cross-conversion between POD,
      Markdown, ReST, nroff and maybe also HTML output.
