NAME
    App::PMVersionsUtils - CLI utilities related to PMVersions

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::PMVersionsUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-PMVersionsUtils), released on 2021-06-22.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities related
    to PMVersions:

    *   version-from-pmversions

FUNCTIONS
  version_from_pmversions
    Usage:

     version_from_pmversions(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Get minimum Perl module version from pmversions.ini.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   module => *perl::modname*

        Module name, if unspecified will use `this-mod` to get the current
        module.

    *   pmversions_path => *filename*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
