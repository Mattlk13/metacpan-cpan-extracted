Revision history for perl module App::Tarotplane

2.00 Tue 5 Nov 2024
  This update uses a new card file format which is incompatible with the
  previous one. You are going to have to rewrite your card files to conform to
  the new format.
  Added:
    - Repository info to META files.
    - App::Tarotplane get() POD.
  Fixes:
    - Add missing $VERSIONs to modules.
    - App::Tarotplane::UI POD typos.
    - Removed irrelevant README info.
    - App::Tarotplane::UI should now be able to recover the terminal if an error
      occurs during init().
  Changes:
    - New card format is used. '%' lines are used as card delimits instead of
      newlines.
    - New card file example in manual.
    - Error messages now report bad card number instead of line number.
  Removed:
    - demo.gif from distribution.
