NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Unbless - Unblessing a reference

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::Unbless
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Unbless), released on
    2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Unblessing a reference.

    Blessing a reference is easy with "bless()" but surprisingly (or
    unsurprisingly?) unblessing a blessed reference is not as simple.
    Currently you can use the "unbless()" function from
    Data::Structure::Util or "damn()" from Acme::Damn (which is a slimmer
    module if you just need unblessing feature). Both are XS modules. If you
    need a pure-Perl solution, currently you're out of luck.
    Function::Fallback::CoreOrPP provides "unbless()" where the fallback
    option is shallow copying.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Data::Structure::Util

    *   Acme::Damn

    *   Function::Fallback::CoreOrPP
