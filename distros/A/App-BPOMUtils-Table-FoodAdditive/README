    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   fields => *array[str]*

        Select fields to return.

    *   id => *int*

        Only return records where the 'id' field equals specified value.

    *   id.in => *array[int]*

        Only return records where the 'id' field is in the specified values.

    *   id.is => *int*

        Only return records where the 'id' field equals specified value.

    *   id.isnt => *int*

        Only return records where the 'id' field does not equal specified
        value.

    *   id.max => *int*

        Only return records where the 'id' field is less than or equal to
        specified value.

        Only return records where the 'id' field is greater than or equal to
        specified value.

        expression pattern.

    *   name.max => *str*

        Only return records where the 'name' field is less than or equal to
        specified value.

    *   name.min => *str*

        Only return records where the 'name' field is greater than or equal
        to specified value.

    *   name.not_contains => *str*

        Only return records where the 'name' field does not contain
        specified text.

    *   name.not_in => *array[str]*

        Only return records where the 'name' field is not in the specified
        values.

    *   name.not_matches => *str*

        Only return records where the 'name' field is greater than specified
        value.

    *   queries => *array[str]*

        Search.

        This will search all searchable fields with one or more specified
        queries. Each query can be in the form of "-FOO" (dash prefix
        notation) to require that the fields do not contain specified
        string, or "/FOO/" to use regular expression. All queries must match
        if the "query_boolean" option is set to "and"; only one query should
        match if the "query_boolean" option is set to "or".

    *   query_boolean => *str* (default: "and")

        Whether records must match all search queries ('and') or just one
        ('or').

        If set to "and", all queries must match; if set to "or", only one
        query should match. See the "queries" option for more details on
        searching.

    *   random => *bool* (default: 0)

        Return records in random order.

    *   result_limit => *int*

        Only return a certain number of records.

    *   result_start => *int* (default: 1)

        Only return starting from the n'th record.

    *   sort => *array[str]*

        Order records according to certain field(s).

        A list of field names separated by comma. Each field can be prefixed
        with '-' to specify descending order instead of the default
        ascending.

    *   with_field_names => *bool*

        Return field names in each record (as hash/associative array).

        When enabled, function will return each record as hash/associative
        array (field name => value pairs). Otherwise, function will return
        each record as list/array (field value, field value, ...).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
