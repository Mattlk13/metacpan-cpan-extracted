NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Foozilla - List of ideas for module/script/project
    name using 'zilla'

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Acme::CPANModules::Foozilla
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Foozilla), released on
    2024-02-16.

DESCRIPTION
    Do you want to name your project "<something>zilla", but searching
    MetaCPAN is difficult because everything is about Dist::Zilla? Here's a
    little help. I've searched using "lcpan" (from App::lcpan):

     lcpan mods --query-type name zilla | grep -iv Dist::

    and the following is the summary.

    Mozilla

    Of course, Mozilla is the biggest name of things foozilla. There's a
    rather decent "Mozilla::" namespace on CPAN with notable modules like
    Mozilla::DOM and Mozilla::Mechanize. There are also
    Software::License::Mozilla_2_0 (and its siblings),
    Graphics::ColorNames::Mozilla, or Wx::Mozilla.

    Bugzilla

    Also from the Mozilla project, hence the name. We have <WWW::Bugzilla>
    on CPAN, but as you know Bugzilla itself is also written in Perl.

    Filezilla

    I can only find the following modules related to this popular file
    transfer software: Software::Catalog::SW::filezilla.

    That's it

    Vast world awaits for your new "*"zilla project.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
