DESCRIPTION
    This package offers a thin CLI for accessing Coinbase Pro API (public or

FUNCTIONS
  private
    Usage:

     private(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    *   method => *str* (default: "GET")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
