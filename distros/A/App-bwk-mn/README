NAME
    App::bwk::mn - Some commands to manage Bulwark masternode

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::bwk::mn (from Perl
    distribution App-bwk-mn), released on 2019-07-22.

SYNOPSIS
    Please see included script bwk-mn.

FUNCTIONS
  new_zfs_snapshot
    Usage:

     new_zfs_snapshot() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Create a new ZFS snapshot.

    This subcommand will:

    1. stop bulwarkd
    2. create a new ZFS snapshot
    3. restart bulwarkd again

    See "restore_from_zfs_snapshot" for more details.

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  restore_from_zfs_snapshot
    Usage:

     restore_from_zfs_snapshot() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Restore broken installation from ZFS snapshot.

    This subcommand will:

    1. stop bulwarkd
    2. rollback to a specific ZFS snapshot
    3. restart bulwarkd again
    4. wait until node is fully sync-ed (not yet implemented)

    For this to work, a specific setup is required. First, at least the
    "blocks/" and "chainstate" directory are put in a ZFS filesystem (this
    part is assumed and not checked) and a snapshot of that filesytem has
    been made. The ZFS filesystem needs to have "bulwark" or "bwk" as part
    of its name, and the snapshot must be named using YYYY-MM-DD. The most
    recent snapshot will be selected.

    Rationale: as of this writing (2019-07-22, Bulwark version 2.2.0.0) a
    Bulwark masternode still from time to time gets corrupted with this
    message in the "debug.log":

     2019-07-22 02:30:17 ERROR: VerifyDB() : *** irrecoverable inconsistency in block data at xxxxxx, hash=xxxxxxxx

    (It used to happen more often prior to 2.1.0 release, and less but still
    happens from time to time since 2.1.0.)

    Resync-ing from scratch will take at least 1-2 hours, and if this
    happens on each masternode every few days then resync-ing will waste a
    lot of time. Thus the ZFS snapshot. Snapshots will of course need to be
    created regularly for this setup to benefit.

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  status
    Usage:

     status() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    bulwark-cli getblockcount + masternode status.

    This is mostly just a shortcut for running "bulwark-cli getblockcount"
    and "bulwark-cli masternode status".

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
