=head1 NAME

pause-and-unpause-firefox - Pause and unpause Firefox alternately

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.016 of pause-and-unpause-firefox (from Perl distribution App-FirefoxUtils), released on 2021-09-27.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

% B<pause-and-unpause-firefox> [B<--debug>|B<--log-level>=I<level>|B<--quiet>|B<--trace>|B<--verbose>] [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] [(B<--periods>=I<duration>)+] [(B<--user>=I<unix::local_uid>)+] [B<--periods-json>=I<json>] [B<--users-json>=I<json>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite browser's
power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser often still eat
considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the background. Pausing
(kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and effective way to stop CPU
eating on Unix and prolong your laptop battery life. It can be performed
whenever you are not using your browser for a little while, e.g. when you are
typing on an editor or watching a movie. When you want to use your browser
again, simply unpause (kill -CONT) it.

The C<pause-and-unpause> action pause and unpause browser in an alternate
fashion, by default every 5 minutes and 30 seconds. This is a compromise to save
CPU time most of the time but then give time for web applications in the browser
to catch up during the unpause window (e.g. for WhatsApp Web to display new
messages and sound notification.) It can be used when you are not browsing but
still want to be notified by web applications from time to time.

If you run this routine, it will start pausing and unpausing browser. When you
want to use the browser, press Ctrl-C to interrupt the routine. Then after you
are done with the browser and want to pause-and-unpause again, you can re-run
this routine.

You can customize the periods via the C<periods> option.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--periods-json>=I<s>

Pause and unpause times, in seconds (JSON-encoded).

See C<--periods>.

=item B<--periods>=I<s@>

Pause and unpause times, in seconds.

For example, to pause for 5 minutes, then unpause 10 seconds, then pause for 2
minutes, then unpause for 30 seconds (then repeat the pattern), you can use:

    300,10,120,30


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--user>=I<s@>

Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--users-json>=I<s>

Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only (JSON-encoded).

See C<--user>.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pause-and-unpause-firefox pause-and-unpause-firefox

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pause-and-unpause-firefox 'p/*/`pause-and-unpause-firefox`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
