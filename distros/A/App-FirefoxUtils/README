FUNCTIONS
  firefox_has_processes
    Usage:

     firefox_has_processes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Firefox has processes.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cmndline_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their cmndline.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the
        default heuristic rules to find the browser processes, these "*-pat"
        options are solely used to determine which processes are the browser
        processes.

    *   exec_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their exec.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the
        default heuristic rules to find the browser processes, these "*-pat"
        options are solely used to determine which processes are the browser
        processes.

    *   fname_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their fname.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the
        default heuristic rules to find the browser processes, these "*-pat"
        options are solely used to determine which processes are the browser
        processes.

    *   pid_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their pid.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the
        default heuristic rules to find the browser processes, these "*-pat"
        options are solely used to determine which processes are the browser
        processes.

    *   quiet => *true*

        (No description)

    *   users => *array[unix::uid::exists]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  firefox_is_paused
    Usage:

     firefox_is_paused(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Firefox is paused.

    Firefox is defined as paused if *all* of its processes are in 'stop'
    state.

    This function is not exported.

        processes.

    *   exec_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their exec.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the

        (No description)

    *   users => *array[unix::uid::exists]*

  firefox_is_running
    Usage:

     firefox_is_running(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Firefox is running.

    Firefox is defined as running if there are some Firefox processes that
    are *not* in 'stop' state. In other words, if Firefox has been started
    but is currently paused, we do not say that it's running. If you want to
    check if Firefox process exists, you can use "ps_firefox".

    Return value: (any)

  pause_and_unpause_firefox
    Usage:

     pause_and_unpause_firefox(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Pause and unpause Firefox alternately.

    A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite
    browser's power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser
    often still eat considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the
    background. Pausing (kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and
    effective way to stop CPU eating on Unix and prolong your laptop battery
    life. It can be performed whenever you are not using your browser for a
    little while, e.g. when you are typing on an editor or watching a movie.
    When you want to use your browser again, simply unpause (kill -CONT) it.

    The "pause-and-unpause" action pause and unpause browser in an alternate
    fashion, by default every 5 minutes and 30 seconds. This is a compromise
    to save CPU time most of the time but then give time for web
    applications in the browser to catch up during the unpause window (e.g.
    for WhatsApp Web to display new messages and sound notification.) It can
    be used when you are not browsing but still want to be notified by web
    applications from time to time.

    If you run this routine, it will start pausing and unpausing browser.
    When you want to use the browser, press Ctrl-C to interrupt the routine.
    Then after you are done with the browser and want to pause-and-unpause
    again, you can re-run this routine.

    You can customize the periods via the "periods" option.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cmndline_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their cmndline.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the
        default heuristic rules to find the browser processes, these "*-pat"

        processes.

    *   exec_pat => *re_from_str*

        Filter processes using regex against their exec.

        If one of the "*-pat" options are specified, then instead of the

        processes.

    *   periods => *array[duration]*

        Pause and unpause times, in seconds.

        pattern), you can use:

         300,10,120,30

    *   pid_pat => *re_from_str*

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
