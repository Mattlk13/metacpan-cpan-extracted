NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap - List of CPAN
    distributions which have been trapped by the one- and two decimal digits
    versioning scheme

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Acme::CPANModules::OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap (from Perl
    distribution Acme-CPANModules-OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap),
    released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    The x.y and x.yy versioning scheme used in Perl distribution has a trap:
    when you release a new version by incrementing the patchlevel part into
    x.y.z and x.yy.z, the new version number will be *less* than x.y and
    x.yy because x.y and x.yy will numify to x.y00 and x.yy0 respectivey;
    while x.y.z and x.yy.z will numify to x.00y.z and x.0yy, respectively.

    So if you release Acme-MyDist-0.1 (numifies to 0.100000) then
    Acme-MyDist-0.1.1 (0.001001), or Acme-MyDist-0.01 (0.010000) then
    Acme-MyDist-0.01.1 (0.001001), PAUSE will *refuse* to index your new
    version because of "decreasing version number."

    This does *not* happen when you release Acme-MyDist-0.001 (0.001000) and
    then Acme-MyDist-0.001.1 (0.001001).

    This thing is peculiar to Perl, and is not intuitive. Consequently,
    sometimes CPAN authors are not familiar with this and thus have fallen
    into this trap.

    This list chronicles distributions which have been trapped by this.

        Author's comment in ChangeLog: "Change version properly."

    Bencher
        From 0.46 to 0.46.1.

        Author's comment in ChangeLog: "This version number is broken
        because 0.46 > 0.46.1 because 0.46 normalizes to 0.460.000 while
        0.46.1 is 0.046.100. This has happened a few times to me in other
        distributions too, so perhaps it's time to consider switching to a
        3-digit minor version."

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
