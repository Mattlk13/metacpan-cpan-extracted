NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap - Chronicle CPAN
    distributions which have been trapped by the one- and two decimal digits
    versioning scheme

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap (from Perl
    distribution Acme-CPANModules-OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap),
    released on 2020-01-03.

DESCRIPTION
    Chronicle CPAN distributions which have been trapped by the one- and two
    decimal digits versioning scheme.

    The x.y and x.yy versioning scheme used in Perl distribution has a trap:
    when you release a new version by incrementing the patchlevel part into
    x.y.z and x.yy.z, the new version number will be *less* than x.y and
    x.yy because x.y and x.yy will numify to x.y00 and x.yy0 respectivey;
    while x.y.z and x.yy.z will numify to x.00y.z and x.0yy, respectively.

    So if you release Acme-MyDist-0.1 (numifies to 0.100000) then
    Acme-MyDist-0.1.1 (0.001001), or Acme-MyDist-0.01 (0.010000) then
    Acme-MyDist-0.01.1 (0.001001), PAUSE will *refuse* to index your new
    version because of "decreasing version number."

    This does *not* happen when you release Acme-MyDist-0.001 (0.001000) and
    then Acme-MyDist-0.001.1 (0.001001).

    This thing is peculiar to Perl, and is not intuitive. Consequently,
    sometimes CPAN authors are not familiar with this and thus have fallen
    into this trap.

    This list chronicles distributions which have been trapped by this.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Validate::Simple - From 0.01 to 0.01.1

        Author's comment in ChangeLog: "Change version properly."

    *   Bencher - From 0.46 to 0.46.1

        Author's comment in ChangeLog: "This version number is broken
        because 0.46 > 0.46.1 because 0.46 normalizes to 0.460.000 while
        0.46.1 is 0.046.100. This has happened a few times to me in other
        distributions too, so perhaps it's time to consider switching to a
        3-digit minor version."

FAQ
  What are ways to use this module?
    Aside from reading it, you can install all the listed modules using
    cpanmodules:

        % cpanmodules ls-entries OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=OneAndTwoDecimalDigitsVersionTrap -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful result for "lcpan
    related-mods" when it comes to finding related modules for the modules
    listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
