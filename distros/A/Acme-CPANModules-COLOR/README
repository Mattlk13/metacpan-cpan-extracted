NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::COLOR - Modules that follow the COLOR convention

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::COLOR (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-COLOR), released on 2018-12-22.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that follow the COLOR convention.

    The NO_COLOR convention (see https://no-color.org) lets user disable
    color output of console programs by defining an environment variable
    called NO_COLOR. The existence of said environment variable, regardless
    of its value, signals that programs should not use colored output.

    Another similar convention is the use of the COLOR environment variable.
    False value (empty string or the value 0) means that programs should
    disable colored output, while true value (values other than the
    mentioned false values) means that programs should enable colored
    output. This convention allows force-enabling colored output instead of
    just force-disabling it, although programs supporting it need to add a
    line of code or two to check the value of the environment variable.

    If you know of other modules that should be listed here, please contact
