NAME
    App::lcpan::CmdBundle::cpanlists - lcpan subcommands related to
    Acme::CPANLists

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.020 of
    App::lcpan::CmdBundle::cpanlists (from Perl distribution
    App-lcpan-CmdBundle-cpanlists), released on 2019-12-26.

SYNOPSIS
    Install this distribution, then the lcpan subcommands below will be
    available:

     # List Acme::CPANLists modules available on CPAN
     % lcpan cpanlists-mods

DESCRIPTION
    This bundle provides the following lcpan subcommands:

    *   lcpan cpanlists-mods

    This distribution packages several lcpan subcommands related to
    Acme::CPANLists. More subcommands will be added in future releases.

    Some ideas:

    cpanlists-stats. Number of modules. But we will want to also know the
    number of lists, total number of entries, average number of entries per
    list, average number of lists per modules.

    Perhaps an indexing hook could be added, so that lcpan indexes the lists
    themselves? To be safer, an Acme::CPANLists module could export the
    lists to a JSON, so lcpan does not have to load the module.

    The indexing part could be modularized, so we can have a SQLite database
    containing list information without having to have lcpan, because lcpan
    database is huge.

    Or (easier)... lcpan could just call this indexer. The cpanlists indexer
    indexes to a separate SQLite database. But note that the cpanlists
    indexer *will* eval/load the modules.
