NAME
    App::CPANModulesUtils - Command-line utilities related to
    Acme::CPANModules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of App::CPANModulesUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-CPANModulesUtils), released on 2021-11-26.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes the following command-line utilities related
    to Acme::CPANModules:

    *   acme-cpanmodules-for

    *   draw-feature-matrix-from-acme-cpanmodules-module

    *   gen-acme-cpanmodules-module-from-acme-cpanlists-list

    *   gen-acme-cpanmodules-module-from-webpage

FUNCTIONS
  acme_cpanmodules_for
    Usage:

     acme_cpanmodules_for(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List Acme::CPANModules distributions that mention specified modules.

    This utility consults lcpan (local indexed CPAN mirror) to check if
    there are Acme::CPANModules distributions that mention specified
    modules. This is done by checking the presence of a dependency with the
    relationship "x_mentions".

    See also App::lcpan which has a "x-mentions-for-mod" subcommand that
    does the same thing.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   modules* => *array[perl::modname]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  gen_acme_cpanmodules_module_from_acme_cpanlists_list
    Usage:

     gen_acme_cpanmodules_module_from_acme_cpanlists_list(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate an Acme::CPANModules module file from an Acme::CPANLists module
    list.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   input_list_index => *nonnegint*

        Required if the Acme::CPANLists module contains more than one module
        list.

    *   input_module* => *perl::modname*

        "Acme::CPANLists::" will be prepended if module name does not begin
        with it.

    *   output_file => *filename*

        will default to "lib/Acme/CPANModules/<YourModuleName>.pm

    *   output_module => *perl::modname*

        "Acme::CPANModules::" will be prepended if module name does not
        begin with it.

        Will default to the Acme::CPANLists module name, with CPANLists
        replaced by CPANModules.

    *   overwrite => *true*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  gen_acme_cpanmodules_module_from_webpage
    Usage:

     gen_acme_cpanmodules_module_from_webpage(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate an Acme::CPANModules module file a webpage.

    This routine will download the webpage, extract the links in it, extract
    the CPAN modules mentioned in the links, and use the extracted CPAN
    modules as entries for the Acme::CPANModules module.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   description => *str*

        Add description to the list.

    *   output_file => *filename*

        will default to "lib/Acme/CPANModules/<YourModuleName>.pm

    *   output_module* => *perl::modname*

        "Acme::CPANModules::" will be prepended if module name does not
        begin with it.

    *   overwrite => *true*

    *   url* => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
