DESCRIPTION
ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    String::FlexMatch
        Author: MARCEL <https://metacpan.org/author/MARCEL>

        An object that can be instructed to match a string with another
        string, a regex, or a coderef. The object overloads the "eq"
        operator so you can abstract the actual matching mechanism and still
        use "eq" in your code. Does not yet provide case-insensitive string
        vs string matching.

        Provide some routines related to matching string.

    match::smart
        Author: TOBYINK <https://metacpan.org/author/TOBYINK>

        A smart-match implementation.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
