    App::AlgorithmDiffUtils - CLI utilities based on Algorithm::Diff

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::AlgorithmDiffUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-AlgorithmDiffUtils), released on 2021-05-25.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities:

    *   algodiff-compact-diff

    *   algodiff-diff

    *   algodiff-hunks

    *   algodiff-lcs

    *   algodiff-sdiff

FUNCTIONS
  algodiff_compact_diff
    Usage:

     algodiff_compact_diff(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Perform compact_diff() on two files.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file1* => *filename*

    *   file2* => *filename*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code

    ($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is
    200. Third element ($payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
    element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
    that contains extra information.

    Return value: (any)
