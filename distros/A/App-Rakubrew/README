NAME
    App::Rakubrew - Raku environment manager

DESCRIPTION
    A tool to manage multiple Rakudo installations.

    See rakubrew.org <https://rakubrew.org/>.

CPAN INSTALLATION
    If you want to install Rakubrew via CPAN there are a few things to watch
    out for. Rakubrew installs an executable "rakubrew". To be able to run
    executables installed via CPAN it's necessary for the respective "bin/"
    folder to be in your "PATH" and "lib/" folder to be in your "PERL5LIB".
    Usually this should be taken care for by your distribution or Perl
    environment manager. If that's not the case, then putting something like
    the following in your "~/.bashrc" will help. You'll need to adapt the
    paths depending on where your Perl modules are installed to.
