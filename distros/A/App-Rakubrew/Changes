1
    - Initial release to an unsuspecting world
    - This is mostly a testing release and not yet recommended for normal use.

2
    - Fix download and self-update command

3
    - Download less during builds by using `--git-cache-dir` rakudo option on
      newer rakudos
    - Add `rakubrew-version` command to list version and some debug info
    - Fix `download` and `self-upgrade` commands
    - Don't error on startup when a broken version is present (e.g. a failed
      build)
    - Fix `shim` mode on Windows
    - Accept "moar-2020.01" style versions in addition to "moar 2020.01" in
      `build` and `download` commands

    - Hopefully make it run on older MacOS as well by switching to a different
      Perl distribution. (#3)
    - Enable building Rakudos on MacOS even though Rakudo currently doesn't
      support building in a folder with spaces. This only works with new enough
      Rakudos.

5
    - Change default installation directory to ~/.rakubrew and C:\rakubrew.
    - Better detect Configure.pl options. This should increase compatibility
      with older Rakudo releases.
    - Warn user when installing to a folder with spaces in its path.
    - Add some minimal testing of rakubrew.
    - Fix build version shell auto completion.

6
    - Move to Dist::Zilla as packaging tool.
    - Tune documentation a bit.
