 % calc-cpan-changes-cwalitee [options] [path]

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--path>=I<s>

=back

=head2 Indicator selection options

=over

=item B<--exclude-indicator-json>=I<s>, B<-X>

Do not use these indicators (JSON-encoded).

See C<--exclude-indicator>.

=item B<--exclude-indicator-module-json>=I<s>

Do not use indicators from these modules (JSON-encoded).

See C<--exclude-indicator-module>.

See C<--exclude-indicator-status>.

=item B<--exclude-indicator-status>=I<s@>

Do not use indicators having these statuses.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--exclude-indicator>=I<s@>

Do not use these indicators.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--include-indicator-json>=I<s>, B<-I>

Only use these indicators (JSON-encoded).

See C<--include-indicator>.

=item B<--include-indicator-module-json>=I<s>

Only use indicators from these modules (JSON-encoded).

See C<--include-indicator-module>.

=item B<--include-indicator-module>=I<s@>

Only use indicators from these modules.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--include-indicator-status-json>=I<s>

=item B<--include-indicator-status>=I<s@>

Default value:

 ["stable"]

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--min-indicator-severity>=I<s>

Minimum indicator severity.

Default value:

 1

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back
