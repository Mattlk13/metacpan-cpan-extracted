SYNOPSIS

    Install this distribution, then the lcpan subcommands below will be
    available:

     # List Data::Sah types available on CPAN
     % lcpan sah-types
    
     # List Data::Sah compilers available on CPAN
     % lcpan sah-compilers

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution packages several lcpan subcommands related to
    Data::Sah. More subcommands will be added in future releases.

    Some ideas:

    For each compiler, show list of (un)supported types (the ones it has
    (doesn't have) the handler for).

    List supported translation languages (Data::Sah::Lang::*).
