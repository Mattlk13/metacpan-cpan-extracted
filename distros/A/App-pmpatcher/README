NAME
    App::pmpatcher - Apply a set of module patches on your Perl installation

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of App::pmpatcher (from Perl
    distribution App-pmpatcher), released on 2017-07-07.

SYNOPSIS
    See pmpatcher CLI.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  pmpatcher
    Usage:

     pmpatcher(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Apply a set of module patches on your Perl installation.

    You might have a set of patches that you want to apply on Perl modules
    on all your Perl installation. For example, currently as of this writing
    I have this on my "patches" directory:

     pm-OrePAN-Archive-0.08-support_no_index_file.patch
     pm-Pod-Elemental-PerlMunger-0.200002-DATA_encoding_fix.patch

    These patches might be pending merge by the module maintainer, or are of
    private nature so might never be merged, or of any other nature.
    Applying module patches to an installation is a lightweight alternative
    to creating a fork for each of these modules.

    This utility helps you making the process of applying these patches more
    convenient. Basically this utility just locates all the target modules
    and feeds all of these patches to the "patch" program.

    To use this utility, first of all you need to gather all your module
    patches in a single directory (see "patches_dir" option). Also, you need
    to make sure that all your "*.patch" files match this name pattern:

     pm-<MODULE-NAME-DASH-SEPARATED>-<VERSION>-<TOPIC>.patch

    Then, to apply all the patches, you just call:

     % pmpatcher --patches-dir ~/patches

    (Or, you might also want to put "patches_dir=/path/to/patches" into
    "~/pmpatcher.conf" to save you from having to type the option
    repeatedly.)

    Example result:

     % pmpatcher
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+
     | item_id                                                      | status | message |
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+
     | pm-OrePAN-Archive-0.08-support_no_index_file.patch           | 200    | Applied |
     | pm-Pod-Elemental-PerlMunger-0.200002-DATA_encoding_fix.patch | 200    | Applied |
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+

    If you try to run it again, you might get:

     % pmpatcher
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+-----------------+
     | item_id                                                      | status | message         |
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+-----------------+
     | pm-OrePAN-Archive-0.08-support_no_index_file.patch           | 304    | Already applied |
     | pm-Pod-Elemental-PerlMunger-0.200002-DATA_encoding_fix.patch | 304    | Already applied |
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+-----------------+

    There's also a "--dry-run" and a "-R" ("--reverse") option, just like
    "patch".

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   patches_dir* => *str*

    *   reverse => *bool*

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
