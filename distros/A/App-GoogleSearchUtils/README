VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of App::GoogleSearchUtils (from

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following utilities:

    *   google-search

FUNCTIONS
  google_search
    Usage:

     google_search(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Open google search page in browser.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action => *str* (default: "open_url")

        What to do with the URLs.

        Instead of opening the queries in browser, you can also do other
        action instead. For example, "print_url" will print the search URL.
        "print_html_link" will print the HTML link (the <a> tag). And
        "print_org_link" will print the Org-mode link, e.g.
        "[[url...][query]]".

    *   append => *str*

        String to add at the end of each query.

    *   delay => *duration*

        Delay between opening each query.

    *   num => *posint* (default: 100)

        Number of results per page.

    *   prepend => *str*

        String to add at the beginning of each query.

    *   queries* => *array[str]*

    *   type => *str* (default: "web")

        Search type.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
