NAME
    App::sorted - Check if lines of a file are sorted

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::sorted (from Perl
    distribution App-sorted), released on 2020-05-25.

SYNOPSIS
    See sorted.

FUNCTIONS
  sorted
    Usage:

     sorted(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Check if lines of a file are sorted.

    Assuming "file.txt"'s content is:

     1
     2
     3

    These will return success:

     % sorted file.txt
     % sorted -S numerically file.txt

    But these will not:

     % sorted -S 'numerically<r>' file.txt
     % sorted -S 'asciibetically<r>' file.txt

    Another example, assuming "file.txt"'s content is:

     1
     zz
     AAA
     cccc

    then this will return success:

     % sorted -S by_length file.txt
     % sorted -q -S by_length file.txt  ;# -q silences output, it just returns appropriate exit code

    while these will not:

     % sorted file.txt
     % sorted -S 'asciibetically<i>' file.txt
     % sorted -S 'by_length<r>' file.txt

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file => *filename* (default: "-")

    *   quiet => *bool*

    *   sort_args => *array[str]*

        Arguments to pass to the Sort::Sub::* routine.

    *   sort_sub => *sortsub::spec*

        Name of a Sort::Sub::* module (without the prefix).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
