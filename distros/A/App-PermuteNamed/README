NAME
    App::PermuteNamed - Permute multiple-valued key-value pairs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::PermuteNamed (from Perl
    distribution App-PermuteNamed), released on 2019-11-29.

FUNCTIONS
  permute_named
    Usage:

     permute_named(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Permute multiple-valued key-value pairs.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         permute_named( aoaos => ["bool,0,1", "x,foo,bar,baz"]);

        Result:

         [
           { bool => 0, x => "foo" },
           { bool => 0, x => "bar" },
           { bool => 0, x => "baz" },
           { bool => 1, x => "foo" },
           { bool => 1, x => "bar" },
           { bool => 1, x => "baz" },
         ]

    This is a CLI for "Permute::Named::*" module (currently using
    "Permute::Named::Iter").

    To enter a pair with multiple values, you enter a comma-separated list
    with the first element is the key name and the rest are values.

    The return will be array of hashes.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   aoaos* => *array[array[str]]*

    *   separator => *str*

        Separator character to use.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
