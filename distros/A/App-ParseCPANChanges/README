NAME
    App::ParseCPANChanges - Parse CPAN Changes file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.072 of App::ParseCPANChanges (from
    Perl distribution App-ParseCPANChanges), released on 2021-05-25.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a simple command-line wrapper for
    CPAN::Changes. See parse-cpan-changes for more details.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_cpan_changes
    Usage:

     parse_cpan_changes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Parse CPAN Changes file.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   class => *perl::modname* (default: "CPAN::Changes")

    *   file => *filename*

        If not specified, will look for file called Changes/ChangeLog in
        current directory.

    *   unbless => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to return Perl objects as unblessed refs.

        If you set this to false, you'll need to use an output format that
        can handle serializing Perl objects, e.g. on the CLI using
        "--format=perl".

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code
    (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
    ($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is
    200. Third element ($payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
    element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
    that contains extra information.

    Return value: (any)
