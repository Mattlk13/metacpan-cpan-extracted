=head1 NAME

findsort - Unix find wrapper that has sorting option

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of findsort (from Perl distribution App-findsort), released on 2024-09-19.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use B<find>, but with optional C<-sort> option:

 % findsort -sort=-mtime -type d -name '*.git'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Despite Unix toolbox philosophy being in general useful, sometimes it's
convenient to merge several Unix utilities into one. This is one of such cases.
Either because B<sort> by default does not offer sorting entries as files, or
because in some situation (e.g. with ssh and Bourne shell account) the syntax to
combine commands is limited.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-findsort>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
