NAME
    App::opan - A CPAN overlay for darkpan and pinning purposes

SYNOPSIS
    Set up an opan (creates a directory tree in "pans/"):

      $ opan init
      $ opan pin MSTROUT/M-1.tar.gz
      $ opan add ./My-Dist-1.23.tar.gz

    Now, you can start the server:

      $ opan daemon -l http://localhost:8030/
      Server available at http://localhost:8030/

    Then in another terminal, run one of:

      $ cpanm --mirror http://localhost:8030/combined/ --mirror-only --installdeps .
      $ PERL_CARTON_MIRROR=http://localhost:8030/combined/ carton install

    Or, to let opan do that part for you, skip starting the server and run
    one of:

      $ opan cpanm --installdeps .
      $ opan carton install

DESCRIPTION
    Two basic approaches to using this thing. First, if you're using carton,
    you can probably completely ignore the pinning system, so just do:

      $ opan init
      $ opan add ./My-DarkPan-Dist-1.23.tar.gz
      $ git add pans/; git commit -m 'fresh opan'
      $ opan carton install

    You can reproduce this install with simply:

      $ opan carton install --deployment

    When you want to update to a new version of the cpan index (assuming you
    already have an additional requirement that's too old in your current
    snapshot):

      $ opan pull
      $ git add pans/; git commit -m 'update pans'
      $ opan carton install

    Second, if you're not using carton, but you want reproducible installs,
    you can still mostly ignore the pinning system by doing:

      $ opan init
      $ opan add ./My-DarkPan-Dist-1.23.tar.gz
      $ opan cpanm --autopin --installdeps .
      $ git add pans/; git commit -m 'opan with current version pinning'

    Your reproducible install is now:

      $ opan cpanm --installdeps .

    When you want to update to a new version of the cpan index (assuming you
    already have an additional requirement that's too old in your current
    snapshot):

      $ opan pull
      $ opan cpanm --autopin --installdeps .
      $ git add pans/; git commit -m 'update pans'

    To update a single dist in this system, the easy route is:

      $ opan unpin Thingy-1.23.tar.gz
      $ opan cpanm Thingy
      Fetching http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/S/SO/SOMEONE/Thingy-1.25.tar.gz
      ...
      $ opan pin SOMEONE/Thing-1.25.tar.gz

    This will probably make more sense if you read the "Commands" and "PANs"
    documentation following before trying to set things up.

  Commands
   init
      opan init

    Creates a "pans/" directory with empty indexes for "custom" and "pinset"
    and a fresh index for "upstream" (i.e. runs "fetch" for you at the end
    of initialisation).

   fetch
      opan fetch

    Fetches 02packages from www.cpan.org into the "upstream" PAN.

   add
      opan add Dist-Name-1.23.tar.gz

    Imports a distribution file into the "custom" PAN under author "MY". Any
    path parts provided before the filename will be stripped.

    Support for other authors is pending somebody explaining why that would
    have a point. See "pin" for the command you probably wanted instead.

   unadd
      opan unadd Dist-Name-1.23.tar.gz

    Looks for a "Dist-Name-1.23.tar.gz" path in the "custom" PAN index and
    removes the entries.

    Does not remove the dist file, see "purge".

   pin
      opan pin AUTHOR/Dist-Name-1.23.tar.gz

    Fetches the file from the "upstream" PAN and adds it to "pinset".

   unpin
      opan unpin Dist-Name-1.23.tar.gz

    Looks for a "Dist-Name-1.23.tar.gz" path in the "pinset" PAN index and
    removes the entries.

    Does not remove the dist file, see "purge".

   merge
      opan merge

    Rebuilds the "combined" and "nopin" PANs' index files.

   pull
      opan pull

    Does an "fetch" then an "merge". There's no equivalent for others, on
    the assumption what you'll do is roughly "pin", "add", "unpin", "unadd",
    ... repeat ..., "pull".

   purgelist
      opan purgelist

    Outputs a list of all non-indexed dists in "pinset" and "custom".

   purge
      opan purge

    Deletes all files that would have been listed by "purgelist".

   daemon
      opan daemon

    Starts a single process server using Mojolicious::Command::daemon.

   prefork
      opan prefork

    Starts a multi-process preforking server using
    Mojolicious::Command::prefork.

   get
      opan get /upstream/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz

    Runs a request against the opan URL space using
    Mojolicious::Command::get.

   cpanm
      opan cpanm --installdeps .

    Starts a temporary server process and runs

      cpanm --mirror http://localhost:<port>/combined/ --mirror-only <your args here>

    Can also be run with one of:

      opan cpanm --nopin <your args here>
      opan cpanm --autopin <your args here>
      opan cpanm --combined <your args here>

    to request a specific PAN.

   carton
      opan carton install

    Starts a temporary server process and runs

      PERL_CARTON_MIRROR=http://localhost:<port>/combined/ carton <your args here>

    Can also be run with one of:

      opan carton --nopin <your args here>
      opan carton --autopin <your args here>
      opan carton --combined <your args here>

    to request a specific PAN.

  PANs
   upstream
    02packages: Fetched from www.cpan.org by the "fetch" command.

    Dist files: Fetched from www.cpan.org on-demand.

   pinset
    02packages: Managed by "pin" and "unpin" commands.

    Dist files: Fetched from www.cpan.org by "pin" command.

   custom
    02packages: Managed by "add" and "unadd" commands.

    Dist files: Imported from local disk by "add" command.

   combined
    02packages: Merged from upstream, pinset and custom PANs by "merge"
    command.

    Dist files: Fetched from custom, pinset and upstream in that order.

   nopin
    02packages: Merged from upstream and custom PANs by "merge" command.

    Dist files: Fetched from custom, pinset and upstream in that order.

   autopin
    Virtual PAN with no presence on disk.

    Identical to nopin, but fetching a dist from upstream does an implict
    "pin".

    Since this can modify your opan config, it's only enabled if the
    environment variable "OPAN_AUTOPIN" is set to a true value (calling the
    "cpanm" or "carton" commands with "--autopin" sets this for you, because
    you already specified you wanted that).

  uploads
    To enable the /upload endpoint, set the ENV var OPAN_AUTH_TOKENS to a
    colon separated list of accepted tokens for uploads. This will allow a
    post with a 'file' upload argument, checking http basic auth password
    against the provided auth tokens.

  recurring pull
    Set ENV OPAN_RECURRING_PULL to a true value to make opan automatically
    pull from upstream every 600 seconds

  custom upstream
    Set the ENV var OPAN_MIRROR to specify a cpan mirror - the default is
    www.cpan.org. Remember that if you need to temporarily overlay your
    overlay but only for one user, there's nothing stopping you setting
    OPAN_MIRROR to another opan.
