=head1 NAME

App::Timestamper::Format - prefix lines with the timestamps of their arrivals.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ long-running-process | tee log | ts-format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Timestamper is a pure-Perl command line program that filters the input
so the timestamps (in seconds+fractions since the UNIX epoch) are prefixed
to the lines based on the time of the arrival.

So if the input was something like:

    First Line
    Second Line
    Third Line

It will become something like:

    1435254285.978485482\tFirst Line
    1435254302.569615087\tSecond Line
    1435254319.809459781\tThird Line
