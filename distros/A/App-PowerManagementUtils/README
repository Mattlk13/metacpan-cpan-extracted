FUNCTIONS
  prevent_sleep_until_interrupted
    Usage:

     prevent_sleep_until_interrupted() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Prevent sleep until interrupted.

    Uses Proc::Govern to run "sleep infinity", with the option `no-sleep' to
    instruct Proc::Govern to disable system from sleeping until interrupted.

    For more options when running command, e.g. timeout, load control,
    autorestart, screensaver control, use the module or its CLI govproc
    directly.

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
