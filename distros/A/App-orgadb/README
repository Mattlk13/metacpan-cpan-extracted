    App::orgadb - An opinionated Org addressbook tool

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::orgadb (from Perl
    distribution App-orgadb), released on 2022-06-24.

SYNOPSIS
FUNCTIONS
  select_addressbook_entries
    Usage:

     select_addressbook_entries(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Select Org document elements using CSel (CSS-selector-like) syntax.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   category => *str_or_re*

    *   color => *str* (default: "auto")

        Whether to use color.

    *   color_theme => *perl::colortheme::modname_with_optional_args*

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   entry => *str_or_re*

        Find entry by string or regex search against its title.

    *   field => *str_or_re*

        Find field by string or regex search.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

        Path to addressbook files.

    *   hide_category => *true*

        Do not show category.

    *   hide_entry => *true*

        Do not entry headline.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
