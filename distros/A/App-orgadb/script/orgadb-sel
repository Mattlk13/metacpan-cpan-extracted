=head1 NAME

orgadb-sel - Select entries and fields from Org addressbook

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.005 of orgadb-sel (from Perl distribution App-orgadb), released on 2022-08-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

First, create a configuration file F<~/.config/orgadb.conf> containing something
like the following (use INI syntax, or L<IOD> to be more exact):

 ; specify your addressbook files here
 files = ~/addressbook.org
 files = /path/to/another-addressbook.org

Suppose you have F<~/addressbook.org> like the following (entries are written as
level-2 headings, level 1 is used for categories, hierarchical categories can be
written using breadcrumb-style notation with ">" separator):

 * family
 ** iwan
 - home phone :: 555-1234-567
 - cell :: 555-8765-432
 - address ::
   + street :: Jl Mangga 123
   + city :: Bandung
   + postcode :: 40123
   + country :: Indonesia
 ** restu
 - cell :: 555-1234-568
 ** satya

 * family > wife's
 ** roger
 ** emily
 ** cynthia

 * work > acme inc
 ** bugs
 ** daffy

 * work > acme inc > ex
 ** marvin

 * work > newsradio
 ** dave
 ** lisa
 - cell :: 555-1234-710
 - home phone :: 555-1234-712
 - note ::
   + [2022-07-03] :: do not call after office hours
 ** joe
 - cell :: 555-1234-569
 - cell :: 555-1234-570
 ** beth

 * work > newsradio > ex
 ** matthew

=head2 Listing all entries

To list all entries (categories will be shown as path prefix):

 % orgadb-sel
 ** family/iwan
 ** family/restu
 ** family/satya
 ** family > wife's/roger
 ** family > wife's/emily
 ** family > wife's/cynthia
 ** work > acme inc/bugs
 ** work > acme inc/daffy
 ** work > acme inc > ex/ marvin
 ** work > newsradio/dave
 ** work > newsradio/lisa
 ** work > newsradio/joe
 ** work > newsradio/beth
 ** work > newsradio > ex/matthew

=head2 Searching entries

To list entries that match the string 'sa':

 % orgadb-sel sa
 ** family/satya
 ** work > newsradio/lisa

To hide the category prefix, use C<-C> (C<--hide-category>):

 % orgadb-sel -C sa
 ** satya
 ** lisa

=head2 Searching categories

To search against the category, use the C<-c> option:

 % orgadb-sel sa -c work; # search for 'sa' from work
 ** work > newsradio/lisa

 % orgadb-sel -c work; # list all entries from work
 ** work > newsradio/dave
 ** work > newsradio/lisa
 ** work > newsradio/joe
 ** work > newsradio/beth
 ** work > newsradio > ex/matthew

To display Lisa's full entry:

 % orgadb-sel lisa -l
 ** work > newsradio/lisa
 - cell :: 555-1234-710
 - home phone :: 555-1234-712
 - note ::
   + [2022-07-03] :: do not call after office hours

 % orgadb-sel lisa -Cl  ;# do not show the category
 ** lisa
 - cell :: 555-1234-710
 - home phone :: 555-1234-712
 - note ::
   + [2022-07-03] :: do not call after office hours

 % orgadb-sel lisa -El  ;# do not show the entry line
 - cell :: 555-1234-710
 - home phone :: 555-1234-712
 - note ::
   + [2022-07-03] :: do not call after office hours

=head2 Searching fields

To get Lisa's cell phone number (search against field):

 % orgadb-sel lisa cell
 ** work > newsradio/lisa
 - cell :: 555-1234-710

To get Lisa's cell phone number (only the number, without the entry headline or
the field name):

 % orgadb-sel lisa cell -E -N
 555-1234-710

To get all Lisa's phone numbers:

 % orgadb-sel lisa -E '/phone|cell/'
 - cell :: 555-1234-710
 - home phone :: 555-1234-712

You can also search subfields. For example, to show Iwan's postcode field value
under the address field:

 % orgadb-sel iwan address postcode -EN
 40123

=head2 Formatting

You can apply one or more formatters to field values:

 % orgadb-sel lisa cell --formatter Str::remove_non_digit -EN
 5551234710

=head2 Shell mode

Instead of selecting one time and exiting, you can instruct B<orgadb> to enter
shell mode, where you can issue multiple select commands without re-reading the
Org addressbook files repeatedly. For example:

 % orgadb-sel -s
 > select lisa
 ...
 > select lisa -l
 ...
 > select lisa cell -E -N
 ...
 > exit

 % _

When the addressbook files change on disk, the files will be re-read.

=head2 Password book

Aside from a regular addressbook, you can also use B<orgadb> with password books
(a file you store passwords in). B<orgadb> can read GnuPG-encrypted files, where
the decrypted content is read into memory and not stored in temporary files. You
can then use shell mode (C<-s>) to repeatedly query the password book without
re-reading and re-decrypting everytime. For example, suppose you have a password
book like this:

 # -*- Mode: org -*-
 * persona > perlancar
 ** google (perlancar)
 - username :: perlancar
 - pass :: secret1
 - security question :: favorite dog in the whole wide world?
 - security answer :: impossible to pick one
 - log ::
   + [2022-07-04 Mon] :: change password
   + [2017-08-01] :: create
 ** twitter (perlancar)
 - username :: perlancar
 - pass :: secret2
 * persona > steven
 ** google (steven123123)
 - username :: steven123123
 - phone :: 555-123-2345
 - pass :: secret3

and you store it in C<~/passwords.gpg>. Then to query passwords:

 # What's my (perlancar)'s google password?
 % orgadb-sel -f ~/passwords.gpg /google.+perlancar/ pass -EN
 secret1

 # What's my (steven)'s phone used in the google account?
 % orgadb-sel -f ~/passwords.gpg /google.+steven/ '/phone|cell/' -EN
 555-123-2345

Or, in shell mode:

 % orgadb-sel -f ~/passwords.gpg -s
 > select /google.+perlancar/ pass -EN
 secret1
 > select /google.+steven/ '/phone|cell/' -EN
 555-123-2345
 > exit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<App::orgadb> is a set of CLIs for addressbook written in Org format. It
currently contains:

=over

=item * orgadb-sel

CLI to list/select addressbook entries and fields.

=back

The addressbook must be written following a certain structure, as shown in the
Synopsis. The first heading level is for putting categories. The second heading
level is where you put all your entries. Fields are written in description list.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--count>

Return just the number of matching entries instead of showing them.

=back

=head2 Color options

=over

=item B<--color-theme-json>=I<s>

See C<--color-theme>.

=item B<--color-theme>=I<s>

=item B<--color>=I<s>

Whether to use color.

Default value:

 "auto"

Valid values:

 ["auto","always","never"]

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can actually be specified multiple times to instruct application to read from
multiple configuration files (and merge them).


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

A single configuration file can contain profiles, i.e. alternative sets of
values that can be selected. For example:

 [profile=dev]
 username=foo
 pass=beaver
 
 [profile=production]
 username=bar
 pass=honey

When you specify C<--config-profile=dev>, C<username> will be set to C<foo> and
C<password> to C<beaver>. When you specify C<--config-profile=production>,
C<username> will be set to C<bar> and C<password> to C<honey>.


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

If you specify C<--no-config>, the application will not read any configuration
file.


=back

=head2 Display options

=over

=item B<--detail>, B<-l>

=item B<--formatter>=I<s@>

Add one or more formatters to display field value.

Specify one or more formatters to apply to the field value before displaying.

A formatter is name of C<Data::Sah::Filter::perl::*> module, without the prefix.
For example: C<Str::uc> will convert the field value to uppercase. Another
formatter, C<Str::remove_comment> can remove comment.

A formatter can have arguments, which is specified using this format:

 [FORMATTER_NAME, {ARG1NAME => ARG1VAL, ...}]

If formatter name begins with C<[> character, it will be parsed as JSON. Example:

 ['Str::remove_comment', {'style':'cpp'}]


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--formatters-json>=I<s>

Add one or more formatters to display field value (JSON-encoded).

See C<--formatter>.

=item B<--hide-category>, B<-C>

Do not show category.

=item B<--hide-entry>, B<-E>

Do not show entry headline.

=item B<--hide-field-name>, B<-N>

Do not show field names, just show field values.

=back

=head2 Entry selection options

=over

=item B<--entry>=I<s>

Find entry by string or regex search against its title.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--filter-entries-by-field>=I<s@>

Find entry by the fields or subfields it has.

The format of each entry_by_field is one of:

 str
 /re/
 str = str2
 str = /re2/
 /re/ = str2
 /re/ = /re2/

That is, it can search for a string (C<str>) or regex (C<re>) in the field name,
and optionally also search for a string (C<str2>) or regex (C<re2>) in the field
value.


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--filter-entries-by-fields-json>=I<s>

Find entry by the fields or subfields it has (JSON-encoded).

See C<--filter-entries-by-field>.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

If you specify C<--no-env>, the application wil not read any environment
variable.


=back

=head2 Field selection options

=over

=item B<--field>=I<s@>

Find (sub)fields by string or regex search.

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--fields-json>=I<s>

Find (sub)fields by string or regex search (JSON-encoded).

See C<--field>.

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument and onwards.

=back

=head2 Filter options

=over

=item B<--category>=I<s>, B<-c>

Find entry by string or regex search against the category title.

=back

=head2 Input options

=over

=item B<--file>=I<s@>, B<-f>

Path to addressbook file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--files-json>=I<s>

Path to addressbook files (JSON-encoded).

See C<--file>.

=item B<--no-reload-files-on-change>

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

By default, these log levels are available (in order of increasing level of
importance, from least important to most): C<trace>, C<debug>, C<info>,
C<warn>/C<warning>, C<error>, C<fatal>. By default, the level is usually set to
C<warn>, which means that log statements with level C<info> and less important
levels will not be shown. To increase verbosity, choose C<info>, C<debug>, or
C<fatal>.

For more details on log level and logging, as well as how new logging levels can
be defined or existing ones modified, see L<Log::ger>.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Mode options

=over

=item B<--shell>, B<-s>

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Result options

=over

=item B<--num-entries>=I<s>

Specify maximum number of entries to return (0 means unlimited).

=item B<--num-fields>=I<s>

Specify maximum number of fields (per entry) to return (0 means unlimited).

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C orgadb-sel orgadb-sel

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete orgadb-sel 'p/*/`orgadb-sel`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why doesn't 'orgadb-sel' list all my entries? It returns nothing.

 % orgadb-sel
 % _

Probably because the addressbook is not written following the expected
structure, where the entries should be as I<level-2> headings. You might use the
level-1 heading:

 * jimmy
 - cell :: 555-123-4567
 * john
 * jack

or use deeper-than-level-2 heading:

 * friends
 ** high school
 *** jimmy
 - cell :: 555-123-4567
 *** john
 *** jack

This is the correct structure:

 * friends > high school
 ** jimmy
 - cell :: 555-123-4567
 ** john
 ** jack

When queried:

 % orgadb-sel
 friends > high school/jimmy
 friends > high school/john
 friends > high school/jack

=head2 Why can't I search against entry fields? It returns nothing. (I can list entries.)

 % orgadb-sel jimmy cell
 % _

Probably because the addressbook is not written following the expected
structure, where you should use a description list. A common mistake is writing
a description list like this:

 ** jimmy
 - cell: 555-123-4567

This is still an unordered list in Org, you have to use C< :: > (space, followed
by two colons, followed by another space) as the separator:

 ** jimmy
 - cell :: 555-123-4567

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F</home/s1/.config/orgadb.conf>, F</home/s1/.config/orgadb-sel.conf>, F</home/s1/orgadb.conf>, F</home/s1/orgadb-sel.conf>, F</etc/orgadb.conf>, or F</etc/orgadb-sel.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

You can also filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable equals some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable includes some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not include some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

To load and configure plugins, you can use either the C<-plugins> parameter (e.g. C<< -plugins=DumpArgs >> or C<< -plugins=DumpArgs@before_validate_args >>), or use the C<[plugin=NAME ...]> sections, for example:

 [plugin=DumpArgs]
 -event=before_validate_args
 -prio=99
 
 [plugin=Foo]
 -event=after_validate_args
 arg1=val1
 arg2=val2

 

which is equivalent to setting C<< -plugins=-DumpArgs@before_validate_args@99,-Foo@after_validate_args,arg1,val1,arg2,val2 >>.
