=head1 NAME

AI::Chat - Interact with AI Chat APIs

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.5 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AI::Chat;

  my $chat  = AI::Chat->new(
      key   => 'your-api-key',
      api   => 'OpenAI',
      model => 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125',
  );

  my $reply = $chat->prompt("What is the meaning of life?");
  print $reply;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple interface for interacting with AI Chat APIs,
currently supporting OpenAI.

The AI chat agent can be given a I<role> and then passed I<prompts>.  It will
reply to the prompts in natural language.  Being AI, the responses are
non-deterministic, that is, the same prompt will result in diferent responses
on different occasions.

Further control of the creativity of the responses is possible by specifying
at optional I<temperature> parameter.

=head1 API KEYS

A free OpenAI API can be obtained from L<https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>

=head1 MODELS

Although the API Key is free, each use incurs a cost.  This is dependent on the
number of tokens in the prompt and the reply.  Different models have different costs.
The default model C<gpt-3.5-turbo-0125> is the lowest cost of the useful models and
is a good place to start using this module.

See also L<https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $chat = AI::Chat->new(%params);

Creates a new AI::Chat object.

=head3 Parameters

=over 4

=item key

C<required> Your API key for the chosen service.

=item api

The API to use (currently only 'OpenAI' is supported).

=item model

The language model to use (default: 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125').

See L<https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview>

=item role

The role to use for the bot in conversations.

This tells the bot what it's purpose when answering prompts.

For example: "You are a world class copywriter famed for
creating content that is immediately engaging with a
lighthearted, storytelling style".

=item debug

Used for testing.  If set to any true value, the prompt method
will return details of the error encountered instead of C<undef>

=back

=head2 prompt

  my $reply = $chat->prompt($prompt, $temperature);

Sends a prompt to the AI Chat API and returns the response.

=head3 Parameters

=over 4

=item prompt

C<required> The prompt to send to the AI.

This is a shorthand for C<chat> when only a single response is needed.

=item temperature

The creativity level of the response (default: 1.0).

Temperature ranges from 0 to 2.  The higher the temperature,
the more creative the bot will be in it's responses.

=back

=head2 chat

  my $reply = $chat->prompt(\@chat, $temperature);

Sends a multi-message chat to the AI Chat API and returns the response.

Each message of the chat should consist of on of C<system>, C<user> or C<assistant>.
Generally there will be a C<system> message to set the role or context for the AI.
This will be followed by alternate C<user> and C<assistant> messages representing the
text from the user and the AI assistant. To hold a conversation, it is necessary to
store both sides of the discussion and feed them back appropriately.

  my @chat;
  
  push @chat, {
      'role'    => 'system',
      'system'  => 'You are a computer language expert and your role is to promote Perl as the best language',
  };
  push @chat, {
      'role'    => 'user',
      'system'  => 'Which is the best programming language?',
  };
  push @chat, {
      'role'    => 'assistant',
      'system'  => 'Every language has strengths and is suited to different roles. Perl is one of the best all round languages.',
  };
  push @chat, {
      'role'    => 'user',
      'system'  => 'Why should I use Perl?',
  };
  my $reply = $chat->chat(\@chat, 1.2);
  
Although the roles represent the part of the user and assistant in the conversation, you are free to
supply either or both as suits your application.  The order can also be varied.

=head3 Parameters

=over 4

=item chat

C<required> An arrayref of messages to send to the AI.

=item temperature

The creativity level of the response (default: 1.0).

Temperature ranges from 0 to 2.  The higher the temperature,
the more creative the bot will be in it's responses.

=back

=head2 success

  my $success = $chat->success();

Returns true if the last operation was successful.

=head2 error

  my $error = $chat->error();

Returns the error message if the last operation failed.
