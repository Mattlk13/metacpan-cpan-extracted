No installation is needed for pltest on Unix-like systems.  You have 2 options:

- run it from where you unpacked it -- as either of
  ./pltest ...
  perl pltest ...
- copy pltest to some directory in your PATH, e.g. ~/bin -- you may need to
  chmod a+x pltest

  You can save some space (and maybe a bit of starting time) by compacting pltest:
  ./pltest -rp 'last if /=head1/; s/^(?:    |\t+ *)//; $. > 1 ? s/^(?:#.*|\cL)?\n// : s/env //; s/\s+#.*//' pltest > DESTINATION/pltest

On Windows you have 3 options:

- run it from where you unpacked it
- copy pltest and pltest.bat to some directory in your PATH
- copy pltest as pltest.pltest to some directory in your PATH -- the 2nd pltest tells Win its type
  If Perl installation didn't add it (Strawberry didn't for me), you must
  set PATHEXT=.PL;%PATHEXT%

Currently pltest doesn't seem to work from Power Shell.  Any help welcome!
