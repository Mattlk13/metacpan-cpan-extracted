     WriteMakefile(
       Alien::Base::Wrapper->new('Alien::libpcre')->mm_args2(
         # MakeMaker args
         NAME => 'My::XS',
         ...
       ),
     );

     use Alien::Base::Wrapper qw( Alien::libpcre !export );
    
     my $builder = Module::Build->new(
       ...
       configure_requires => {
         'Alien::libpcre' => '0',

       },
       Alien::Base::Wrapper->mb_args,
       ...
     );
    
     $build->create_build_script;

    In your FFI::Platypus script or module:

     use FFI::Platypus;

       lib => [ Alien::libpcre->dynamic_libs ],
     );

DESCRIPTION

    Note that this Alien is for PCRE1, the deprecated older version of the
    Perl (in)Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library. It exists for
    projects that require the older version of PCRE. Currently the author
    uses it for source builds of Alien::libnewrelic and NewFangle. If you
    need the newer currently supported version of PCRE see Alien::PCRE2.

    This distribution provides PCRE1 so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to detect
    an existing install of pcre on your system. If found it will use that.
    If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded from the
    internet and it will be installed in a private share location for the
    use of other modules.

CAVEATS

    The pcre, is not, as the name might suggest, actually compatible with
    modern Perl regular expressions.

    On Debian based systems (including Ubuntu), the development package for
    PCRE1 is libpcre3-dev, which is quite confusing, but I am sure there
    was a good reason for it. If you want to do a system install use that
    package not the confusingly newer libpcre2-dev.
