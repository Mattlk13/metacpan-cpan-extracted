FUNCTIONS
  calc_accumulated_inflation
    Usage:

     calc_accumulated_inflation(%args) -> any

    Calculate accumulated inflation over the years.

    Examples:

    *   See accumulated 6%/year inflation for 10 years:

         calc_accumulated_inflation(yearly_rate => 6);

        Result:

         [
           { index => 1, year => 0 },
           { index => "1.0600", year => 1 },
           { index => 1.1236, year => 2 },
           { index => "1.1910", year => 3 },
           { index => 1.2625, year => 4 },
           { index => 1.3382, year => 5 },
           { index => 1.4185, year => 6 },
           { index => 1.5036, year => 7 },
           { index => 1.5938, year => 8 },
           { index => 1.6895, year => 9 },
           { index => 1.7908, year => 10 },
         ]

    *   Indonesia's inflation rate for 2003-2014:

         calc_accumulated_inflation(rates => [5.16, 6.4, 17.11, 6.6, 6.59, 11.06, 2.78, 6.96, 3.79, 4.3, 8.38, 8.36]);

        Result:

         [
           { index => 1, year => 0 },
           { index => 1.0516, rate => "5.16%", year => 1 },
           { index => 1.1189, rate => "6.40%", year => 2 },
           { index => 1.3103, rate => "17.11%", year => 3 },
           { index => 1.3968, rate => "6.60%", year => 4 },
           { index => 1.4889, rate => "6.59%", year => 5 },
           { index => 1.6536, rate => "11.06%", year => 6 },
           { index => 1.6995, rate => "2.78%", year => 7 },
           { index => 1.8178, rate => "6.96%", year => 8 },
           { index => 1.8867, rate => "3.79%", year => 9 },
           { index => 1.9678, rate => "4.30%", year => 10 },
           { index => 2.1327, rate => "8.38%", year => 11 },
           { index => "2.3110", rate => "8.36%", year => 12 },
         ]

    This routine generates a table of accumulated inflation over a period of
    several years. You can either specify a fixed rate for every years
    ("yearly_rate"), or specify each year's rates ("rates").

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   base_index => *float* (default: 1)

    *   base_year => *float* (default: 0)

    *   rates => *array[float]*

        Different rates for each year, in percent.

    *   yearly_rate => *float*

        A single rate for every year, in percent.

    *   years => *int* (default: 10)

    Return value: (any)
