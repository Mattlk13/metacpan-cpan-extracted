# NAME

Art::World - An Art World simulator game ðŸŽ¨

# SYNOPSIS

    use Art::World;

# DESCRIPTION

Art::World is an attempt to model an art world simulation system. If a
correct API is reached, we'll try to build a "game of art" frontend.

- 01 Idea is the first step of process
- 02 Idea is inserted in the file (through process)
- 03 Idea comes from discourse (given about project)
- 04 Idea come when there is no time left
- 05 Ideas constitue the project

- 06 Process allows ideas to evolve
- 07 Process allows to fill the file (with ideas + discourse)
- 08 Process allows to generate some discourse
- 09 Process allows to save time
- 10 Process allows to set up the project

- 11 File is made of ideas
- 12 File is filled and emptied with the process
- 13 File is made of discourse
- 14 File archive ideas, that makes possible to forget them
- 15 File generate a project

- 16 Discourse steers ideas
- 17 Discourse analyze process
- 18 Discourse talks about the file
- 19 Discourse allows to link various stages of the projet
- 20 Discourse is a constituent of the project

- 21 From time to time, ideas appears
- 22 Time needed to apply the process
- 23 Time is suspended into file, process is off there
- 24 Discourse's time (reading time)
- 25 Various times contained in project give it's shape

- 26 Project is updated by new ideas
- 27 Project is constantly updated by the process
- 28 Project is set up when file is updated
- 29 Project and discourse are inseparable
- 30 Project is what takes the longuest time to set up
