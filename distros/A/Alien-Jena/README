NAME
    Alien::Jena - Find or build Jena semantic web library

SYNOPSIS
    Command line tool:

     use Alien::Jena;
     use Env qw( @PATH );

     unshift @PATH, Alien::Jena->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides Jena so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to detect
    an existing install of Jena on your system. If found it will use that.
    If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded from the
    internet and it will be installed in a private share location for the
    use of other modules.
