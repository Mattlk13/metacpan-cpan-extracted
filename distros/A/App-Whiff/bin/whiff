#pod F<which> is a useful utility, found on most unix systems.  It gives you the
#pod absolute path for the first occurrence of a program in your path.
#pod Unfortunately, it does two stupid things:  first, if it can't find one, it
#pod prints an error message to stdout; secondly, if you give it multiple arguments,
#pod it assumes you want one line per argument, each like calling which
#pod individually.
#pod
#pod F<whiff> assumes that all the arguments form a best-first list of alternatives,
#pod and only prints the path to the first alternative found in the path.  If none
#pod is found, it prints an error (to stderr!) and exits with an error code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<which> is a useful utility, found on most unix systems.  It gives you the
absolute path for the first occurrence of a program in your path.
Unfortunately, it does two stupid things:  first, if it can't find one, it
prints an error message to stdout; secondly, if you give it multiple arguments,
it assumes you want one line per argument, each like calling which
individually.

F<whiff> assumes that all the arguments form a best-first list of alternatives,
and only prints the path to the first alternative found in the path.  If none
is found, it prints an error (to stderr!) and exits with an error code.

=head1 PERL VERSION

This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work
on any version of perl released in the last five years.

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
the minimum required perl.

=head1 USAGE

 whiff <command ... >
