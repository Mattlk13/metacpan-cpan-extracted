NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Sudoku - Sudoku-related modules on CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::Sudoku (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Sudoku), released on 2021-01-12.

DESCRIPTION
    Recently (Dec 2020) I picked up more interest in Sudoku, as I was
    spending more time at home with the kids, and there was a book of Sudoku
    puzzles lying around in the room.

    There are certainly more modules on CPAN for solving Sudoku puzzles
    compared to modules/scripts that let you play Sudoku. Basically, I find
    that there's no good playable Sudoku game on CPAN.

    Playing

    <pm::Games::Sudoku::CLI>. Since it's CLI (prompt-based) instead of TUI,
    it's not really convenient to play unless you're a CLI freak.

    <pm::Games::Sudoku::Component::TkPlayer>. It's GUI and barely playable,
    but clunky and not pretty. There's no visual indicator for separating
    the larger 3x3 boxes.

    Generating

    These modules can generate Sudoku puzzles for you, though not let you
    interactively play/solve them.

    Spreadsheet::HTML::Presets::Sudoku

    Solving

    There's no shortage of modules written to solve Sudoku puzzles. I plan
    to benchmark these but for now here's the list:

    Games::Sudoku::Lite

    Games::Sudoku::Solver

    Games::Sudoku::General

    Games::Sudoku::CPSearch

    Games::Sudoku::Kubedoku

    Games::Sudoku::SudokuTk

    Games::Sudoku::OO::Board

    Games::YASudoku

    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more

    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanmodules CLI
    (from App::cpanmodules distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Sudoku | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Sudoku -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Sudoku::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n
