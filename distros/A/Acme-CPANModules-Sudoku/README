NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Sudoku - List of Sudoku-related modules on CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of Acme::CPANModules::Sudoku (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Sudoku), released on 2022-03-18.

DESCRIPTION
    Recently (Dec 2020) I picked up more interest in Sudoku, as I was
    spending more time at home with the kids, and there was a book of Sudoku
    puzzles lying around in the room.

    Playing

    There are certainly more modules on CPAN for solving Sudoku puzzles
    compared to for playing. And between the two available modules for
    playing, I find that there's currently no good playable Sudoku game on
    CPAN. Sad but true. You'd be better off opening your browser and
    visiting <https://websudoku.com> or <https://sudoku.com>, or installing
    *ksudoku* or *gnome-sudoku* if you're using KDE/GNOME, or *sudoku* (by
    Michael Kennett) or *nudoku* if you like playing on the terminal.

    (CPAN does still contain some playable games though. I did enjoy
    *Games::FrozenBubble* and still play *Games::2048* from time to time.)

    These modules are available for playing Sudoku:

    Games::Sudoku::CLI. Since it's CLI (prompt-based) instead of TUI, it's
    not really convenient to play unless you're a CLI freak.

    Games::Sudoku::Component::TkPlayer. It's GUI, but clunky and not pretty.
    There's no visual indicator for separating the larger 3x3 boxes.

    Generating

    These modules can generate Sudoku puzzles for you, though not let you
    interactively play/solve them:

    Spreadsheet::HTML::Presets::Sudoku

    Solving

    There is no shortage of modules written to solve Sudoku puzzles. I plan
    to benchmark these but for now here's the list:

    Games::Sudoku::Lite

    Games::Sudoku::Solver

    Games::Sudoku::General

    Games::Sudoku::CPSearch

    Games::Sudoku::Kubedoku

    Games::Sudoku::SudokuTk

    Games::Sudoku::OO::Board

    Games::YASudoku

    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Sudoku

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Sudoku | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
