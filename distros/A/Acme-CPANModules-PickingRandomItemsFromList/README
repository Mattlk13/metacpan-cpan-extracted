NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomItemsFromList - Picking random items
    from a list

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomItemsFromList (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-PickingRandomItemsFromList), released on 2019-09-15.

DESCRIPTION
    Picking random items from a list.

    If you are picking random lines from a file, there's a separate
    CPANModules list for it: Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomLinesFromFile.
    If your "list" is a Perl array, there's "shuffle" from List::Util and
    "samples" from List::MoreUtils (if you don't want duplicates) or you can
    just select random elements using "rand()" if you don't mind duplicates.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   List::Util

    *   List::MoreUtils
