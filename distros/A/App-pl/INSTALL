No installation is needed for pl on Unix-like systems.  You have 2 options:

- run it from where you unpacked it -- as either of
  ./pl ...
  perl pl ...
- copy pl to some directory in your PATH, e.g. ~/bin -- you may need to
  chmod a+x pl

  You can save some space (and maybe a bit of starting time) by compacting pl:
  ./pl -rp 'last if /=head1/; s/^(?:    |\t+ *)//; $. > 1 ? s/^(?:#.*|\cL)?\n// : s/env //; s/\s+#.*//' pl > DESTINATION/pl

On Windows you have 3 options:

- run it from where you unpacked it
- copy pl and pl.bat to some directory in your PATH
- copy pl as pl.pl to some directory in your PATH -- the 2nd pl tells Win its type
  If Perl installation didn't add it (Strawberry didn't for me), you must
  set PATHEXT=.PL;%PATHEXT%

Currently pl doesn't seem to work from Power Shell.  Any help welcome!
