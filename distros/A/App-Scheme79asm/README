App-Scheme79asm version 0.001
=============================

SIMPLE is a LISP processor defined in the 1979
B<Design of LISP-Based Processors> paper by Steele and Sussman.

The SIMPLE processor expects input in a particular tagged-pointer
format. This module takes a string containing a sequence of
S-expressions of the form C<(tag . value)> representing a tagged
pointer. Here the tag is either a number or one of several predefined
values (see the source for a full list), and the value is either a
number or another tagged pointer. These values are laid out in memory
and a block of verilog code assigning the memory contents to an array
named C<mem> is printed.
