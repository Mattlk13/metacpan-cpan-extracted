NAME

    Alien::libvterm - Alien wrapping for libvterm

DESCRIPTION

    This CPAN distribution wraps the C library libvterm in a wrapper
    suitable to drive CPAN and other Perl-related build infrastructure.

    If the C library is already installed and known by pkg-config, this
    module provides a simple access to its configuration. If not, the
    process of installing it will install a locally-bundled copy of the
    library into perl's arch-specific library directory.

    This module bundles libvterm version 0.2.

METHODS

    This module behaves like ExtUtils::PkgConfig, responding to the same
    methods, except that the module name is implied. Thus, the
    configuration can be obtained by calling

       $cflags = Alien::libvterm->cflags
       $libs = Alien::libvterm->libs
    
       $ok = Alien::libvterm->atleast_version( $version )
    
       etc...
