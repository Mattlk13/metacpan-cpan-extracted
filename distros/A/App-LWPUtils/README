NAME
    App::LWPUtils - Command-line utilities related to LWP

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::LWPUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-LWPUtils), released on 2019-04-15.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to LWP and
    LWP::UserAgent:

    *   lwputil-request

    *   lwputil-request-plugin

FUNCTIONS
  lwputil_request
    Usage:

     lwputil_request(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Perform request(s) with LWP::UserAgent.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   attributes => *hash*

        Pass attributes to LWP::UserAgent constructor.

    *   content => *str*

    *   headers => *hash*

    *   ignore_errors => *bool*

        Ignore errors.

        Normally, when given multiple URLs, the utility will exit after the
        first non-success response. With "ignore_errors" set to true, will
        just log the error and continue. Will return with the last error
        response.

    *   method => *str* (default: "GET")

    *   raw => *bool*

    *   urls* => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  lwputil_request_plugin
    Usage:

     lwputil_request_plugin(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Perform request(s) with LWP::UserAgent::Plugin.

    Like "lwputil_request", but uses LWP::UserAgent::Plugin instead of
    LWP::UserAgent. See the documentation of LWP::UserAgent::Plugin for more
    details.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   attributes => *hash*

        Pass attributes to LWP::UserAgent constructor.

    *   content => *str*

    *   headers => *hash*

    *   ignore_errors => *bool*

        Ignore errors.

        Normally, when given multiple URLs, the utility will exit after the
        first non-success response. With "ignore_errors" set to true, will
        just log the error and continue. Will return with the last error
        response.

    *   method => *str* (default: "GET")

    *   raw => *bool*

    *   urls* => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
