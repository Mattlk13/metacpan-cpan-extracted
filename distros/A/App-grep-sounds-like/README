NAME
    App::grep::sounds::like - Print lines with words that sound like to the
    specified word

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::grep::sounds::like (from
    Perl distribution App-grep-sounds-like), released on 2024-11-20.

FUNCTIONS
  grep_sounds_like
    Usage:

     grep_sounds_like(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Print lines with words that sound like to the specified word.

    This is a grep-like utility that greps for text in input that has
    word(s) that sound like the specified text. By default uses the
    "Metaphone" algorithm.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algo => *perl::modname* (default: "Metaphone")

        Phonetic algorithm to use, should be a module under
        `Text::Phonetic::` without the prefix.

    *   color => *str* (default: "auto")

        Specify when to show color (never, always, or auto/when
        interactive).

    *   count => *true*

        Supress normal output; instead return a count of matching lines.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    *   files_with_matches => *true*

        Supress normal output; instead return filenames with matching lines;
        scanning for each file will stop on the first match.

    *   files_without_match => *true*

        Supress normal output; instead return filenames without matching
        lines.

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

        If set to true, will search case-insensitively.

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        Invert the sense of matching.

    *   line_number => *true*

        Show line number along with matches.

    *   quiet => *true*

        Do not print matches, only return appropriate exit code.

    *   word* => *str*

        Word to compare.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
