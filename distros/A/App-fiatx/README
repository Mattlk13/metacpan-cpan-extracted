FUNCTIONS
  all_spot_rates
    Usage:

     all_spot_rates(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Get all spot (latest) rates from a source.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   db_name* => *str*

    *   db_password => *str*

    *   db_username => *str*

    *   max_age_cache => *posint* (default: 14400)

        Above this age (in seconds), we retrieve rate from remote source
        again.

    *   source* => *str* (default: ":any")

        Ask for a specific remote source.

        If you want a specific remote source, you can specify it here. The
        default is ':any' which is to pick the first source that returns a
        recent enough current rate.

        Other special values: ":highest" to return highest rate of all
        sources, ":lowest" to return lowest rate of all sources, ':newest'
        to return rate from source with the newest last update time,
        ':oldest' to return rate from source with the oldest last update
        time, ':average' to return arithmetic average of all sources.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
