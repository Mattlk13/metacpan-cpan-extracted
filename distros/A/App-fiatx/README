VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::fiatx (from Perl
    distribution App-fiatx), released on 2018-05-10.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script fiatx.

FUNCTIONS
  convert
    Usage:

     convert(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Convert two currencies using current rate.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   amount => *num* (default: 1)

    *   db_name* => *str*

    *   db_password => *str*

    *   db_username => *str*

    *   from* => *currency::code*

    *   max_age_cache => *posint* (default: 14400)

        Above this age (in seconds), we retrieve rate from remote source
        again.

    *   max_age_current => *posint* (default: 86400)

        Above this age (in seconds), we no longer consider the rate to be
        "current" but "historical".

    *   to* => *currency::code*

    *   type => *str* (default: "sell")

        Which rate is wanted? e.g. sell, buy.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
