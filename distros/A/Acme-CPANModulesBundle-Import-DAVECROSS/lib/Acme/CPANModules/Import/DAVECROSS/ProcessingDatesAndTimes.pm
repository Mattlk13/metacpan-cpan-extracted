=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?

An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list of module
names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to categorize modules and
document CPAN. See L<Acme::CPANModules> for more details.

=head2 What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?

Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation, you can
install all the listed modules (entries) using L<cpanm-cpanmodules> script (from
L<App::cpanm::cpanmodules> distribution):

 % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Import::DAVECROSS::ProcessingDatesAndTimes

Alternatively you can use the L<cpanmodules> CLI (from L<App::cpanmodules>
distribution):

    % cpanmodules ls-entries Import::DAVECROSS::ProcessingDatesAndTimes | cpanm -n

or L<Acme::CM::Get>:

    % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=Import::DAVECROSS::ProcessingDatesAndTimes -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

or directly:

    % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Import::DAVECROSS::ProcessingDatesAndTimes -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Import::DAVECROSS::ProcessingDatesAndTimes::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

This Acme::CPANModules module also helps L<lcpan> produce a more meaningful
result for C<lcpan related-mods> command when it comes to finding related

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
