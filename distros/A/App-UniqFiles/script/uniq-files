=head1 NAME

uniq-files - Report or omit duplicate file contents

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.130 of uniq-files (from Perl distribution App-UniqFiles), released on 2019-12-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % uniq-files [options] <files> ...

Examples:

List all files which do no have duplicate contents:

 % uniq-files *

List all files which have duplicate contents:

 % uniq-files -d *

List number of occurences of contents for each file:

 % uniq-files -c *

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a list of filenames, will check each file size and content for duplicate
content. Interface is a bit like the C<uniq> Unix command-line program.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--count>

Whether to return each file content's number of occurence.

1 means the file content is only encountered once (unique), 2 means there is one
duplicate, and so on.


=item B<--files-json>=I<s>

See C<--files>.

=item B<--files>=I<s@>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--no-check-content>

If set to 0, uniqueness will be determined solely from file size. This can be
quicker but might generate a false positive when two files of the same size are
deemed as duplicate even though their content are different.


=item B<--no-report-unique>

=item B<--report-duplicate>=I<s>

Whether to return duplicate items.

Default value:

 2

Can be set to either 0, 1, 2.

If set to 2 (the default), will only return the first of duplicate items. For
example: file1 contains text 'a', file2 'b', file3 'a'. Only file1 will be
returned because file2 is unique and file3 contains 'a' (already represented by
file1).

If set to 1, will return all the the duplicate items. From the above example:
file1 and file3 will be returned.

If set to 0, duplicate items will not be returned.


=item B<-d>

Alias for --noreport-unique --report-duplicate=1.

See C<--no-report-unique>.

=item B<-u>

Alias for --report-unique --report-duplicate=0.

See C<--no-report-unique>.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C uniq-files uniq-files

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete uniq-files 'p/*/`uniq-files`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/uniq-files.conf>, F<~/uniq-files.conf>, or F</etc/uniq-files.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

List of available configuration parameters:

 check_content (see --no-check-content)
 count (see --count)
 files (see --files)
 format (see --format)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)
 report_duplicate (see --report-duplicate)
 report_unique (see --no-report-unique)
