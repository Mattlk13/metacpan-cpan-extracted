NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CLI::PasswordManager - List of various password
    manager CLIs on CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::CLI::PasswordManager (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-CLI-PasswordManager), released on 2025-01-06.

DESCRIPTION
    Password manager CLIs are command-line tools which you can use to store
    and retrieve password entries.

    If you know of others, please drop me a message.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    App::PasswordManager
        A simple script that lets you add, edit, list, and delete passwords
        from the CLI. Passwords are stored in "~/.password_manager.json" in
        a simple JSON object (hash) structure. Currently a very early
        release that still needs to be updated.

        Pros:

        *   simplicity.

        Cons:

        *   At the time of this writing (version 1.0.0) only the password
            hash is stored and returned, making this application unusable at
            the moment.

        *   Password must be entered as command-line argument, making it
            visible from process list and shell history, unless you
            explicitly disable those.

        *   Cannot add other fields to a record, e.g. comment/note, date,
            etc.

        *   Usernames are not encrypted.

        Script: password_manager

    App::orgadb
        A CLI to read entries from an addressbook file in a specific layout
        in Org format. This tool can be used to read from a PGP-encrypted
        addressbook file, and thus can also be used as a password retriever.

        Pros:

        *   Standard tool and format for the data storage (PGP-encrypted Org
            file, which can be edited with Emacs).

        Cons:

        *   Does not come with the functionality of adding/editing/removing
            entries. Use your editor like Emacs to do so.

        Script: orgadb-sel

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
