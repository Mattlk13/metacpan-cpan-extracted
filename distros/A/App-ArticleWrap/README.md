# Article Wrap
Wrap news articles or mail files. That is to say, don't wrap the header lines at
the top but do wrap the rest of the file. Also don't wrap "source code" which is
fenced by Markdown code fences: trible backticks. Don't wrap short lines (10
characters or less). Don't wrap lines with whitespace at the end. Don't wrap
empty lines.

This is useful when post-processing a message written using ed for posting using
tin, for example.
