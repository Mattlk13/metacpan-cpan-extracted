NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::BloomFilters - Bloom filter modules on CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::BloomFilters
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-BloomFilters), released on
    2018-05-12.

DESCRIPTION
    Bloom filter modules on CPAN.

    My default, go-to choice is Algorithm::BloomFilter, unless there's a
    specific feature I need from other implementations.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Bloom::Filter

        Does not provide mehods to save/load to/from strings/files, although
        you can just take a peek at the source code or the hash object and
        get the filter there. Performance might not be stellar since it's
        pure-Perl.

    *   Bloom16

        An Inline::C module. Barely documented. Also does not provide filter
        saving/loading methods.

    *   Algorithm::BloomFilter

        XS, made by SMUELLER. Can merge other bloom filters. Provides
        serialize and deserialize methods.

    *   Bloom::Scalable

        Pure-perl module. A little weird, IMO, e.g. with hardcoded
        filenames. The distribution also provides Bloom::Simple.

    *   Bloom::Simple

        Pure-perl module. A little weird, IMO, e.g. with hardcoded
        filenames. The distribution also provides Bloom::Simple.

    *   Bloom::Faster

        XS module. Serialize/deserialize directly to/from files, no string
        (de)serialization provided.

    *   Text::Bloom

        Pure-Perl module, part of Text-Document distribution. Uses
        Bit::Vector.

    *   App::BloomUtils

    *   Bencher::Scenarios::BloomFilters
