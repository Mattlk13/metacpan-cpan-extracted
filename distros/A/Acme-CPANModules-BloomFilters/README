NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::BloomFilters - Bloom filter modules on CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::BloomFilters
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-BloomFilters), released on
    2021-05-28.

DESCRIPTION
    Bloom filter is a data structure that allows you to quickly check
    whether an element is in a set. Compared to a regular hash, it is much
    more memory-efficient. The downside is that bloom filter can give you
    false positives, although false negatives are not possible. So in
    essence you can ask a bloom filter which item is "possibly in set" or
    "definitely not in set". You can configure the rate of false positives.
    The larger the filter, the smaller the rate. Some examples for
    application of bloom filter include: 1) checking whether a password is
    in a dictionary of millions of common/compromised passwords; 2) checking
    an email address against leak database; 3) virus pattern checking; 4)
    IP/domain blacklisting/whitelisting.

    In Perl, my default go-to choice is Algorithm::BloomFilter, unless
    there's a specific feature I need from other implementations.

ACME::MODULES ENTRIES
    *   Bloom::Filter

        Does not provide mehods to save/load to/from strings/files, although
        you can just take a peek at the source code or the hash object and
        get the filter there. Performance might not be stellar since it's
        pure-Perl.

    *   Bloom16

        An Inline::C module. Barely documented. Also does not provide filter
        saving/loading methods.

    *   Algorithm::BloomFilter

        XS, made by SMUELLER. Can merge other bloom filters. Provides
        serialize and deserialize methods.

    *   Bloom::Scalable

        Pure-perl module. A little weird, IMO, e.g. with hardcoded
        filenames. The distribution also provides Bloom::Simple.

    *   Bloom::Simple

        Pure-perl module. A little weird, IMO, e.g. with hardcoded
        filenames. The distribution also provides Bloom::Simple.

    *   Bloom::Faster

        XS module. Serialize/deserialize directly to/from files, no string
        (de)serialization provided.

    *   Text::Bloom

        Pure-Perl module, part of Text-Document distribution. Uses
        Bit::Vector.

    *   App::BloomUtils

    *   Bencher::Scenarios::BloomFilters

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n BloomFilters

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries BloomFilters | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=BloomFilters -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::BloomFilters -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::BloomFilters::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
