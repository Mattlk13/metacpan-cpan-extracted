App::lcpan::Manual::Tips - Tips related to App::lcpan

=head1 VERSION

version 1.058.000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Filtering result rows

Some subcommands offer filtering rows by some criteria, e.g. C<lcpan mods> allow
selecting only modules from a certain author (C<--author>) or recentness in the
index (C<--added-since>, C<--updated-since-last-index-update>, etc). But
sometimes a subcommand does not offer filtering options or you need to filter
based on some other criteria. There's a utility L<td> (from L<App::td>) which
allows you to filter/transform result rows easily.

Some examples:

 # Show recently updated modules that are not released by PERLANCAR
 % lcpan mods --updated-since-last-index-update -l | td grep '$_->{author} ne "PERLANCAR"' --page

 # Show dependencies of App-lcpan to File::* modules
 % lcpan deps App-lcpan | td grep '$_->{module} =~ /^File::/' --page
