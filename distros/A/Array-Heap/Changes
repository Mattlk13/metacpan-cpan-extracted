Revision history for Perl extension Array::Heap.

3.22  Wed Dec  7 13:06:05 CET 2016
	- work around a bug in perl 5.20 and later where undef array elements
          sometimes are represented by 0-pointers, on which perl functions
          later crash.

3.21  Wed Jul 15 01:39:13 CEST 2015
	- mentioned Array::Heap::PriorityQueue::* modules
          with easier API.
        - suppress soem bogus warnings on some old 5.12 perls.

3.2   Wed Jul 15 01:25:19 CEST 2015
	- perl 5.10 changed how $a a,d $b variables work,
          causing functions to fail when called form multiple packages
          since then (analyzed by Bob Mathews).
	- added t/03_pkg.t, based on testcase by Bob Mathews.
        - added stability canary support.

3.1   Mon Oct 27 23:33:24 CET 2014
	- simplify logic in splice_heap.
        - report out-of-bounds indices in adjust_heap*,
          instead of crashing or worse.

3.0   Fri Apr 19 22:11:11 CEST 2013
	- implement _idx variants that also keep an index value
          updates in array references.

2.0   Sun Jul 26 07:25:27 CEST 2009
	- complete rewrite (use the hopefully clearer
          libev hash functions).
	- add splice_heap and adjust_heap family of functions.
	- speed up _cmp family of functions by using the MULTICALL
          API.
        - clarify comparison function semantics.
        - comparison is now >, not >=.
        - speed up of everything by taking advantage of the freedom the
          "no magical/tied stuff is supported" rule.

1.3   Sun Jul 26 04:58:00 CEST 2009
	- push_heap_cmp tried to push the comparison function
          as data element (analyzed by Mark Kidwell).

1.1   Sat Sep 22 15:38:18 CEST 2007
