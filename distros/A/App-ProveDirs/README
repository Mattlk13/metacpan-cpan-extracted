NAME
    App::ProveDirs - Prove one or more directories

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of App::ProveDirs (from Perl
    distribution App-ProveDirs), released on 2020-03-07.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script prove-dirs.

FUNCTIONS
  prove_dirs
    Usage:

     prove_dirs(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Prove one or more directories.

    Given one or more directories as argument (which are assumed to be
    directories of Perl distributions), this utility "cd" to each directory
    and run "prove" in each. It then provides a summary at the end.

    You can run with "--dry-run" ("-n") option first to not actually run
    "prove" but just see what directories will get tested. An example
    output:

     % prove-dirs perl-* -n
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Acme-CPANModules' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Data-Sah' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Data-Sah-Filter' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Date-strftimeq' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Log-ger' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Log-ger-Output-Screen' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Module-Installed-Tiny' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Text-ANSITable' ...
     prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-lib-filter' ...

    If we reinvoke the above command without the "-n", *prove-dirs* will
    actually run "prove" in each directory and provide a summary at the end.
    Example output:

     % prove-dirs perl-* -n
     ...
     +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | dist                        | reason                            | status |
     +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | perl-Acme-CPANModules       | Test failed (Failed 1/1 subtests) | 500    |
     | perl-Date-strftimeq         | Test failed (No subtests run)     | 500    |
     | perl-lib-filter             | Non-zero exit code (2)            | 500    |
     +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

    The above example shows that three directories (distributions) failed
    testing. You can scroll up for the detailed "prove" output to see why
    they failed, fix things, and re-run.

    When a distribution's test fails, this counts as a 500 error (Error).
    Otherwise, the status is 200 (OK).

    *prove-dirs* will return status 200 (OK) with the status of each
    directory. It will exit 0 if all directories are successful, otherwise
    it will exit 1.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dirs* => *array[dirname]*

        The directories.

    *   prove_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-l"])

        Options to pass to the prove command.

    *   summarize_all => *bool*

        If true, also summarize successes in addition to failures.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
