=head1 NAME

prove-dirs - Prove one or more directories

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.005 of prove-dirs (from Perl distribution App-ProveDirs), released on 2020-03-07.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % prove-dirs [options] <dir> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given one or more directories as argument (which are assumed to be directories
of Perl distributions), this utility C<cd> to each directory and run C<prove> in
each. It then provides a summary at the end.

You can run with C<--dry-run> (C<-n>) option first to not actually run C<prove> but
just see what directories will get tested. An example output:

 % prove-dirs perl-* -n
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Acme-CPANModules' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Data-Sah' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Data-Sah-Filter' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Date-strftimeq' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Log-ger' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Log-ger-Output-Screen' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Module-Installed-Tiny' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-Text-ANSITable' ...
 prove-dirs: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove in directory 'perl-lib-filter' ...

If we reinvoke the above command without the C<-n>, I<prove-dirs> will actually
run C<prove> in each directory and provide a summary at the end. Example output:

 % prove-dirs perl-* -n
 ...
 +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
 | dist                        | reason                            | status |
 +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
 | perl-Acme-CPANModules       | Test failed (Failed 1/1 subtests) | 500    |
 | perl-Date-strftimeq         | Test failed (No subtests run)     | 500    |
 | perl-lib-filter             | Non-zero exit code (2)            | 500    |
 +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

The above example shows that three directories (distributions) failed testing.
You can scroll up for the detailed C<prove> output to see why they failed, fix
things, and re-run.

When a distribution's test fails, this counts as a 500 error (Error). Otherwise,
the status is 200 (OK).

I<prove-dirs> will return status 200 (OK) with the status of each directory. It
will exit 0 if all directories are successful, otherwise it will exit 1.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--dir>=I<s@>*

The directories.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--dirs-json>=I<s>

The directories (JSON-encoded).

See C<--dir>.

=item B<--prove-opt>=I<s@>

Options to pass to the prove command.

Default value:

 ["-l"]

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--prove-opts-json>=I<s>

Options to pass to the prove command (JSON-encoded).

See C<--prove-opt>.

=item B<--summarize-all>

If true, also summarize successes in addition to failures.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--dry-run>

Run in simulation mode (also via DRY_RUN=1).

Default value:

 ""

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C prove-dirs prove-dirs

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete prove-dirs 'p/*/`prove-dirs`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
