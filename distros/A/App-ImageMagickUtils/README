NAME
    App::ImageMagickUtils - Utilities related to ImageMagick

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::ImageMagickUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-ImageMagickUtils), released on 2020-06-25.

FUNCTIONS
  downsize_image
    Usage:

     downsize_image(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Reduce image size, by default via compressing to JPEG quality 40 and
    downsizing to 1024p.

    This utility uses convert utility to compress an image into JPEG with
    default quality of 40 and downsized to 1024p (shortest side to 1024px).

    Output filenames are:

     ORIGINAL_NAME.q40.jpg

    or (if downsizing is done):

     ORIGINAL_NAME.1024p-q40.jgp

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   downsize_to => *str* (default: 1024)

        Downsizing will only be done if the input image's shortest side is
        indeed larger then the target downsize.

        To disable downsizing, set "--downsize-to" to '' (empty string), or
        specify on "--dont-downsize" on the CLI.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

    *   q => *int* (default: 40)

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
