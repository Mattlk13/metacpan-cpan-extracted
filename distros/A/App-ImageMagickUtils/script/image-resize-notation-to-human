     <resize>

Examples:

 % image-resize-notation-to-human ''
 no resizing

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 50%
 scale to 50%

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 50%x50%
 scale width to 50%, height to 50%

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 720
 set width to 720px

 % image-resize-notation-to-human '720>'
 shrink width to 720px

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 720^
 enlarge width to 720px

 % image-resize-notation-to-human x720
 set height to 720px

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 'x720>'

 % image-resize-notation-to-human x720^
 enlarge height to 720px

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 640x480
 fit image inside 640x480

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 640x480^
 fit image to fit 640x480 inside it

 % image-resize-notation-to-human '640x480>'
 shrink image to fit inside 640x480

 % image-resize-notation-to-human '640x480<'
 enlarge image to fit 640x480 inside it

 % image-resize-notation-to-human 640x480!
 set dimension to 640x480

 % image-resize-notation-to-human '720^>'
 shrink shortest side to 720px

 % image-resize-notation-to-human '720^<'
 enlarge shortest side to 720px

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--resize>=I<s>*

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C image-resize-notation-to-human image-resize-notation-to-human

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete image-resize-notation-to-human 'p/*/`image-resize-notation-to-human`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
