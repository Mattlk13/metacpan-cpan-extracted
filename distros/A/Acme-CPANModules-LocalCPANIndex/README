NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANIndex - Creating an index against local CPAN
    mirror

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANIndex (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-LocalCPANIndex), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Creating an index against local CPAN mirror.

    Since CPAN repository index is just a couple of text files (currently:
    list of authors in "authors/01mailrc.txt.gz" and list of packages in
    "modules/02packages.details.txt.gz"), to perform more complex or
    detailed queries additional index is often desired. The following
    modules accomplish that.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   App::lcpan

        In addition to downloading a CPAN mini mirror (using CPAN::Mini),
        this utility also indexes the package list and distribution metadata
        into a SQLite database so you can perform various queries, like list
        of modules/distributions/scripts of a CPAN author, or related
        modules using cross-mention information on modules' PODs, or various
        rankings.

    *   CPAN::SQLite

        This module parses the two CPAN text file indexes
        ("authors/01mailrc.txt.gz" and "modules/02packages.details.txt.gz")
        and puts the information into a SQLite database. This lets you
        perform queries more quickly without reparsing the text files each
        time. But it does not parse distribution metadata so you don't get
        additional querying capability like dependencies.
