NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANIndex - List of modules/tools to create an
    index against local CPAN mirror

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANIndex (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-LocalCPANIndex), released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    Since CPAN repository index is just a couple of text files (currently:
    list of authors in "authors/01mailrc.txt.gz" and list of packages in
    "modules/02packages.details.txt.gz"), to perform more complex or
    detailed queries additional index is often desired. The following
    modules accomplish that.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    App::lcpan
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        In addition to downloading a CPAN mini mirror (using CPAN::Mini),
        this utility also indexes the package list and distribution metadata
        into a SQLite database so you can perform various queries, like list
        of modules/distributions/scripts of a CPAN author, or related
        modules using cross-mention information on modules' PODs, or various
        rankings.

    CPAN::SQLite
        Author: STRO <https://metacpan.org/author/STRO>

        This module parses the two CPAN text file indexes
        ("authors/01mailrc.txt.gz" and "modules/02packages.details.txt.gz")
        and puts the information into a SQLite database. This lets you
        perform queries more quickly without reparsing the text files each
        time. But it does not parse distribution metadata so you don't get
        additional querying capability like dependencies.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n LocalCPANIndex

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries LocalCPANIndex | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=LocalCPANIndex -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::LocalCPANIndex -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::LocalCPANIndex::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
