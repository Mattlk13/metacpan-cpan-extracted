DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides DuckDB so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions that require it. DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP
    database management system that provides fast analytics on large
    datasets.

    This Alien distribution will download and install the appropriate
    pre-built DuckDB binaries for your platform. It supports Linux (x86_64,
    aarch64), macOS (Universal), and Windows (x86_64, arm64).

METHODS

 dynamic_libs

     my @libs = Alien::DuckDB->dynamic_libs;

    Returns a list of dynamic libraries (usually a single dynamic library)
    that make up DuckDB. This is the recommended way to use DuckDB via FFI.
