NAME
    Alt::Lexical::Var::ButSupportModernPerl - alternative distribution of
    Lexical::Var, with support for more modern versions of Perl

SYNOPSIS
       use Lexical::Var;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an alternative distribution of Lexical::Var, allowing use on Perl
    5.21.7 and above. If you have had no problems installing Lexical::Var,
    then you do not need this module!

    Hopefully an official release of Lexical::Var with support for modern Perl
    will happen, and I'll be able to remove this abomination from the CPAN.
    :-)

    Version 0.001 of Alt::Lexical::Var::ButSupportModernPerl includes version
    0.009 of Lexical::Var.

SEE ALSO
    Alt, Lexical::Var.
