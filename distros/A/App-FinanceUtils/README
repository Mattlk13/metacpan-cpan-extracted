    # INSERT_EXECS_LIST

FUNCTIONS
  calc_fv_future_value
    Usage:

     calc_fv_future_value(%args) -> any

    Calculate future value (fv) from present value (pv), return rate (r),
    and periods (n).

    Examples:

    *   Invest $100 at 6% annual return rate for 5 years:

         calc_fv_future_value(pv => 100, r => 0.06, n => 5); # -> [200, "OK", 133.82255776]

    Formula is:

     fv = pv*(1+r)**n

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   n* => *float*

        Number of periods.

    *   pv* => *float*

        present value.

    *   r* => *float*

        Return rate (e.g. 0.06 for 6%).

    Return value: (any)

  calc_fv_periods
    Usage:

     calc_fv_periods(%args) -> any

    Calculate periods (n) from future value (fv), present value (pv), and
    return rate (r).

    Examples:

    *   Want to get $120 using $100 investment with annual 6% return rate,
        how many years must we wait?:

         calc_fv_periods(fv => 120, pv => 100, r => 0.06); # -> [200, "OK", 3.12896813521953]

    Formula is:

     n = log(fv/pv) / log(1+r)

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   fv* => *float*

        future value.

    *   pv* => *float*

        present value.

    *   r* => *float*

        Return rate (e.g. 0.06 for 6%).

    Return value: (any)

  calc_fv_present_value
    Usage:

     calc_fv_present_value(%args) -> any

    Calculate present value (pv) from future value (fv), return rate (r),
    and periods (n).

    Examples:

    *   Want to get $100 after 5 years at 6% annual return rate, how much to
        invest?:

         calc_fv_present_value(fv => 100, r => 0.06, n => 5); # -> [200, "OK", 74.7258172866057]

    Formula is:

     pv = fv/(1+r)**n

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   fv* => *float*

        future value.

    *   n* => *float*

        Number of periods.

    *   r* => *float*

        Return rate (e.g. 0.06 for 6%).

    Return value: (any)

  calc_fv_return_rate
    Usage:

     calc_fv_return_rate(%args) -> any

    Calculate return rate (r) from future value (fv), present value (pv),
    and periods (n).

    Examples:

    *   Want to get $120 in 5 years using $100 investment, what is the
        required return rate?:

         calc_fv_return_rate(fv => 120, pv => 100, n => 5); # -> [200, "OK", 0.0371372893366482]

    Formula is:

     r = (fv/pv)**(1/n) - 1

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   fv* => *float*

        future value.

    *   n* => *float*

        Number of periods.

    *   pv* => *float*

        present value.

    Return value: (any)
