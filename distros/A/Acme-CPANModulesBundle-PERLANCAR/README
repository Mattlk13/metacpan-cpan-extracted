NAME
    Acme::CPANModulesBundle::PERLANCAR - PERLANCAR's collection of
    Acme::CPANModules::* modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.010 of
    Acme::CPANModulesBundle::PERLANCAR (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModulesBundle-PERLANCAR), released on 2021-11-13.

DESCRIPTION
ACME::CPANMODULES MODULES
    The following Acme::CPANModules::* modules are included in this
    distribution:

    *   PERLANCAR::Avoided

        Modules I'm currently avoiding.

        This is a list of modules I'm currently avoiding to use in my code,
        for some reason. Most of the modules wered used in my code in the
        past.

        Using a Dist::Zilla plugin
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Acme::CPANModules::Blacklist, you can make sure
        that during building, your distribution does not specify a
        prerequisite to any of the modules listed here. (You should make
        your own blacklist though).

    *   PERLANCAR::MyGetoptLongExperiment

        My experiments writing Getopt::Long replacements/alternatives.

        Most of these modules provide a Getopt::Long-compatible interface,
        but they differ in some aspect: either they offer more features (or
        less).

    *   PERLANCAR::Retired

        Retired modules.

        This is a list of some of the modules which I wrote but have now
        been retired and purged from CPAN, for various reasons but mostly
        because they are no longer necessary. I've purged/retired more
        modules than these (mostly failed experiments) but they are not
        worth mentioning here because nobody else seems to have used them.

        Note that you can always get these retired modules from BackPAN or
        GitHub (I don't purge most of the repos) if needed.

    *   PERLANCAR::Weird

        Weird modules.

        List of modules I find weird (non-pejoratively speaking) in one way
        or another, e.g. peculiar API, name.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
