NAME
    App::BashHistoryUtils - CLI utilities related to bash history file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.070 of App::BashHistoryUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-BashHistoryUtils), released on 2021-05-26.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes the following CLI utilities:

    *   delete-bash-history-entries

    *   each-bash-history-entry

    *   grep-bash-history-entries

FUNCTIONS
  delete_bash_history_entries
    Usage:

     delete_bash_history_entries(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Delete matching entries from bash history file.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   histfile => *str* (default: "/home/u1/.bash_history")

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   inplace => *bool*

        Replace original bash history file.

    *   invert_match => *bool*

    *   max_age => *duration*

        Match entries older than a certain age.

    *   min_age => *duration*

        Match entries younger than a certain age.

    *   pattern => *re*

        Match entries using a regex pattern.

    *   strip_timestamp => *bool*

        Strip timestamps.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  each_bash_history_entry
    Usage:

     each_bash_history_entry(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Run Perl code for each bash history entry.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   code* => *str*

        Perl code to run for each entry.

        Inside the code, you can set $PRINT to 0 to suppress the output of
        the entry. You can modify $_ to modify the entry. $TS (timestamp) is
        also available.

    *   histfile => *str* (default: "/home/u1/.bash_history")

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   invert_match => *bool*

    *   max_age => *duration*

        Match entries older than a certain age.

    *   min_age => *duration*

        Match entries younger than a certain age.

    *   strip_timestamp => *bool*

        Strip timestamps.
