SYNOPSIS

     use Array::AllUtils qw(first);
    
     my @ary = (1..20);
    
     $elem = first { defined and $_ % 2 } $ary;

DESCRIPTION

    PURELY EXPERIMENTAL AND CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE.

    This module provides functions like those provided by List::Util and
    List::MoreUtils but the list is passed as arrayref, to avoid the cost
    of argument copying which can be significant when the size of the list
    is large. See an illustration in Bencher::Scenario::PERLANCAR::In.

FUNCTIONS
