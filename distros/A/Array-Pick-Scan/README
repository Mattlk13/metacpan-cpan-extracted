NAME
    Array::Pick::Scan - Pick random items from an array (or iterator),
    without duplicates

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of Array::Pick::Scan (from Perl
    distribution Array-Pick-Scan), released on 2022-05-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use Array::Pick::Scan qw(pick);

     my $item  = pick(\@ary);
     my @items = pick(\@ary, 3);

    or:

     my $item  = pick(\&iterator);
     my @items = pick(\&iterator, 3);

    To return array indexes instead of the items:

     my @item  = pick($source, $n, {pos=>1});

DESCRIPTION
    This module can return random items from an array (or iterator), without
    duplicate elements (i.e. random sampling without replacement). It uses
    the same algorithm as File::Random::Pick, which in turn uses a slightly
    modified version of algorithm described in perlfaq ("perldoc -q "random
    line"")), but uses items from an array/iterator instead of lines from a
    file(handle).

    Performance-wise, this module is inferior to List::Util's "shuffle" or
    List::MoreUtils's "samples", but can be useful in cases where you have
    an iterator and do not want to put all the iterator's items into memory
    first.

FUNCTIONS
  pick
    Usage:

     my @items = pick(\@ary      [ , $num_samples [ , \%opts ] ]);
     my @items = pick(\&iterator [ , $num_samples [ , \%opts ] ]);

    Number of samples defaults to 1.

    Options:

    *   pos

        Bool. If set to true, will return array indexes instead of the
        items.

  random_item
    Older name for "pick", deprecated and will be removed in future
    releases.

SEE ALSO
    File::Random::Pick uses a similar algorithm.

    List::Util's "shuffle", List::MoreUtils's "samples", List::AllUtils's
    "sample".

    Array::Sample::SimpleRandom provides random sampling without replacement
    (same as picking in this module) as well as with replacement (creating
    possible duplicate items).

    Array::Sample::WeightedRandom lets you add weighting to each item.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
