NAME
    App::ProgUtils - Command line to manipulate programs in PATH

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.204 of App::ProgUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-ProgUtils), released on 2023-12-03.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities related
    to programs found in PATH:

    1. allprogs
    2. list-all-programs-in-path
    3. progcat
    4. progedit
    5. progless
    6. proglist
    7. progman
    8. progpath
    9. scriptlist

    The main feature of these utilities is tab completion.

FUNCTIONS
  list_all_programs_in_path
    Usage:

     list_all_programs_in_path(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List all programs in PATH.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   with_path => *bool*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

FAQ
  What is the purpose of this distribution? Haven't other similar utilities existed?
    For example, mpath from Module::Path distribution is similar to pmpath
    in App::PMUtils, and mversion from Module::Version distribution is
    similar to pmversion from App::PMUtils distribution, and so on.

    True. The main point of these utilities is shell tab completion, to save
    typing.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
