NAME
    App::ChromeUtils - Utilities related to Google Chrome browser

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of App::ChromeUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-ChromeUtils), released on 2021-09-27.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to Google Chrome
    browser:

    *   chrome-has-processes

    *   chrome-is-paused

    *   chrome-is-running

    *   kill-chrome

    *   list-chrome-profiles

    *   pause-and-unpause-chrome

    *   pause-chrome

    *   ps-chrome

    *   restart-chrome

    *   start-chrome

    *   terminate-chrome

    *   unpause-chrome

FUNCTIONS
  chrome_has_processes
    Usage:

     chrome_has_processes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Chrome has processes.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  chrome_is_paused
    Usage:

     chrome_is_paused(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Chrome is paused.

    Chrome is defined as paused if *all* of its processes are in 'stop'
    state.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  chrome_is_running
    Usage:

     chrome_is_running(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Chrome is running.

    Chrome is defined as running if there are some Chrome processes that are
    *not* in 'stop' state. In other words, if Chrome has been started but is
    currently paused, we do not say that it's running. If you want to check
    if Chrome process exists, you can use "ps_chrome".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  pause_and_unpause_chrome
    Usage:

     pause_and_unpause_chrome(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Pause and unpause Chrome alternately.

    A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite
    browser's power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser
    often still eat considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the
    background. Pausing (kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and
    effective way to stop CPU eating on Unix and prolong your laptop battery
    life. It can be performed whenever you are not using your browser for a
    little while, e.g. when you are typing on an editor or watching a movie.
    When you want to use your browser again, simply unpause (kill -CONT) it.

    The "pause-and-unpause" action pause and unpause browser in an alternate
    fashion, by default every 5 minutes and 30 seconds. This is a compromise
    to save CPU time most of the time but then give time for web
    applications in the browser to catch up during the unpause window (e.g.
    for WhatsApp Web to display new messages and sound notification.) It can
    be used when you are not browsing but still want to be notified by web
    applications from time to time.

    If you run this routine, it will start pausing and unpausing browser.
    When you want to use the browser, press Ctrl-C to interrupt the routine.
    Then after you are done with the browser and want to pause-and-unpause
    again, you can re-run this routine.

    You can customize the periods via the "periods" option.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   periods => *array[duration]*

        Pause and unpause times, in seconds.

        For example, to pause for 5 minutes, then unpause 10 seconds, then
        pause for 2 minutes, then unpause for 30 seconds (then repeat the
        pattern), you can use:

         300,10,120,30

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

     pause_chrome(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]
