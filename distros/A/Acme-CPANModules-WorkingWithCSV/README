NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithCSV - List of modules/applications to work
    with CSV (comma-separated value) data in Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithCSV (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-WorkingWithCSV), released on 2023-10-31.

DESCRIPTION
    The following are tools (modules and scripts) to work with the CSV
    format:

    Parsing

    First things first, the most important module to work with CSV in Perl
    is Text::CSV (which will use Text::CSV_XS backend when possible but fall
    back to Text::CSV_PP otherwise). It's not in core, but only a cpanm
    command away.

    Generating CSV from Perl array/structure

    Text::CSV (as well as Text::CSV_XS) can render a line of CSV from Perl
    array(ref) with their say() method.

    dd2csv from App::CSVUtils

    Perinci::CmdLine framework can render function result (CLI output) as
    CSV.

    Converting to/from other formats

    *INI*: ini2csv from App::TextTableUtils

    *TSV*: csv2tsv and Ltsv2csv from App::CSVUtils

    *LTSV*: csv2ltsv from App::CSVUtils and Lltsv2csv from App::LTSVUtils

    *XLS* and *XLSX*: csv2tsv and tsv2csv from App::CSVUtils

    *JSON*: csv2json and json2csv from App::TextTableUtils

    *Markdown table*: csv2mdtable from App::TextTableUtils

    *Org table*: csv2orgtable from App::TextTableUtils

    *SQLite database*: csv2sqlite from App::SQLiteUtils

    Rendering as text/ASCII table

    csv2texttable from App::TextTableUtils

    Changing field separator character, field quote character, and/or escape
    character

    csv-csv from App::CSVUtils

    Adding/removing columns

    csv-add-fields, csv-delete-field, csv-select-fields from App::CSVUtils

    Processing columns of CSV with Perl code

    csv-munge-field from App::CSVUtils

    Processing rows of CSV with Perl code

    Aside from the obvious Text::CSV, you can also use csv-each-row,
    csv-munge-row, csv-mp from App::CSVUtils.

    csv-setop, csv-concat from App::CSVUtils

    Splitting a CSV file into several

    csv-split from App::CSVUtils

    Sorting CSV rows

    csv-sort from App::CSVUtils

    Sorting CSV columns

    csv-sort-fields from App::CSVUtils

    Filtering CSV columns

    csv-select-fields from App::CSVUtils

    Filtering CSV rows

    csv-grep and csv-select-rows from App::CSVUtils

    csvgrep from csvgrep

    Transposing CSV

    csv-transpose from App::CSVUtils

    Summing and averaging rows

    csv-sum and csv-avg from App::CSVUtils

    Producing frequency table from CSV

    csv-freqtable from App::CSVUtils

    Performing set operations (intersection, union, difference) on CSV

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n WorkingWithCSV

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries WorkingWithCSV | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=WorkingWithCSV -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::WorkingWithCSV -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithCSV::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
