=head1 NAME

fatpack-modules - Generate source code that contains fatpacked modules

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.11 of fatpack-modules (from Perl distribution App-FatPackUtils), released on 2017-07-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % fatpack-modules [options] [module_name] ...

Examples:

Fatpack two modules:

 % fatpack-modules Text::Table::Tiny Try::Tiny

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine provides the same core technique employed by C<App::Fatpack> (which
is putting modules' source code inside Perl variables and loading them on-demand
via require hook) without all the other stuffs. All you need is supply the names
of modules (or the modules' source code themselves) and you'll get the output in
a file or string.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--add-begin-block>

Surround the code inside BEGIN { }.

=item B<--line-prefix>=I<s>

=item B<--no-assume-strict>

=item B<--pm>

Make code suitable to put inside .pm file instead of script.

This setting adjusts the code so it is suitable to put one or several instances
of the code inside one or more .pm files. Also sets default for --line-prefix
'#' --no-add-begin-block --put-hook-at-the-end.


=item B<--put-hook-at-the-end>

Put the require hook at the end of @INC using "push" instead of at the front using "unshift".

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Input options

=over

=item B<--module-name>=I<modulename>, B<-m>

Module names to search.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--module-names-json>=I<modulename>

Module names to search (JSON-encoded).

See C<--module-name>.

=item B<--module-src>=I<s>%

Module source codes (a hash, keys are module names).

Each value is a name-value pair, use I<key=value> syntax. Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--module-srcs-json>=I<s>

Module source codes (a hash, keys are module names) (JSON-encoded).

See C<--module-src>.

=item B<--postamble>=I<s>

Perl source code to add after the fatpack code.

=item B<--preamble>=I<s>

Perl source code to add before the fatpack code.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--output>=I<filename>, B<-o>

Output filename.

=item B<--overwrite>

Overwrite output if previously exists.

=back

=head2 Stripping options

=over

=item B<--no-stripper-comment>

Set strip_comment=0 (don't strip comments) in Perl::Stripper.

=item B<--no-stripper-pod>

Set strip_pod=0 (don't strip POD) in Perl::Stripper.

=item B<--no-stripper-ws>

Set strip_ws=0 (don't strip whitespace) in Perl::Stripper.

=item B<--stripper>

Strip included modules using Perl::Stripper.

=item B<--stripper-log>

Set strip_log=1 (strip log statements) in Perl::Stripper.

=item B<--stripper-maintain-linum>

Set maintain_linum=1 in Perl::Stripper.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C fatpack-modules fatpack-modules

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using L<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immediately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete fatpack-modules 'p/*/`fatpack-modules`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/fatpack-modules.conf>, F<~/fatpack-modules.conf>, or F</etc/fatpack-modules.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
