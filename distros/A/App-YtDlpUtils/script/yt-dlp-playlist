yt-dlp-playlist - Download a playlist with yt-dlp

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of yt-dlp-playlist (from Perl distribution App-YtDlpUtils), released on 2024-07-09.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % yt-dlp-playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a wrapper for B<yt-dlp> which does the following:

=over

=item * add track number prefix to filename

The wrapper adds this option:

 -o '%(playlist_index)s-%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s'

So instead of the default '%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s' filename pattern like
these:

 Introduction to Astronomy: Crash Course Astronomy #1-0rHUDWjR5gg.mp4
 Naked Eye Observations: Crash Course Astronomy #2-L-Wtlev6suc.mp4
 Cycles in the Sky: Crash Course Astronomy #3-01QWC-rZcfE.mp4
 ...

you get:

 01-Introduction to Astronomy: Crash Course Astronomy #1-0rHUDWjR5gg.mp4
 02-Naked Eye Observations: Crash Course Astronomy #2-L-Wtlev6suc.mp4
 03-Cycles in the Sky: Crash Course Astronomy #3-01QWC-rZcfE.mp4

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
