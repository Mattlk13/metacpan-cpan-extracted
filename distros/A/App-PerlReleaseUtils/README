NAME
    App::PerlReleaseUtils - Collection of utilities related to Perl
    distribution releases

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::PerlReleaseUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-PerlReleaseUtils), released on 2021-07-27.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities related
    to Perl distribution releases:

    *   grep-perl-release

FUNCTIONS
  grep_perl_release
    Usage:

     grep_perl_release(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_latest_versions => *posint*

        Exclude latest N version(s) of each dist.

    *   include_dev_release => *bool* (default: 1)

    *   include_latest_versions => *posint*

        Only include latest N version(s) of each dist.

    *   include_nondev_release => *bool* (default: 1)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

FAQ
  What is the purpose of this distribution? Haven't other similar utilities existed?
    For example, mpath from Module::Path distribution is similar to pmpath
    in App::PMUtils, and mversion from Module::Version distribution is
    similar to pmversion from App::PMUtils distribution, and so on.

    True. The main point of these utilities is shell tab completion, to save
    typing.
