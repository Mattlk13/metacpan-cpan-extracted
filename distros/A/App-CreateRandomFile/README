NAME
    App::CreateRandomFile - Create file with random content

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.021 of App::CreateRandomFile (from
    Perl distribution App-CreateRandomFile), released on 2023-11-20.

SYNOPSIS
    See create-random-file.

FUNCTIONS
  create_random_file
    Usage:

     create_random_file(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Create file with random content.

    Examples:

    *   Create a file of size 1MB containing random bytes:

         create_random_file(name => "file1", size => "1M");

    *   Like the previous example (--random-bytes is optional):

         create_random_file(name => "file2", size => "2M", random_bytes => 1);

    *   Create a file of size 3.5KB containing repeated pattern:

         create_random_file(name => "file3", size => "3.5K", patterns => ["AABBCC"]);

    *   Create a file of size 4KB containing random sequences of A, B, C:

         create_random_file(name => "file4", size => "4K", patterns => ["A", "B", "C"]);

    Create "random" file with a specified size. There are several choices of
    what random data to use:

    *   random bytes, created using rand()

    *   repeated pattern supplied from "--pattern" command-line option

    TODO:

    *   random bytes, source from /dev/urandom

    *   random lines from a specified file

    *   random byte sequences from a specified file

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   interactive => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether or not the program should be interactive.

        If set to false then will not prompt interactively and usually will
        proceed (unless for dangerous stuffs, in which case will bail
        immediately.

    *   name* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   overwrite => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to overwrite existing file.

        If se to true then will overwrite existing file without warning. The
        default is to prompt, or bail (if not interactive).

    *   patterns => *array[str]*

        (No description)

    *   random_bytes => *bool*

        (No description)

    *   size* => *str*

        Size (e.g. 10K, 22.5M).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
