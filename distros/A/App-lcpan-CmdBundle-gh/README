CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
