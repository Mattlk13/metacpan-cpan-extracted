NAME
    App::CekBpom - Check BPOM products via the command-line (CLI interface
    for cekbpom.pom.go.id)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.008 of App::CekBpom (from Perl
    distribution App-CekBpom), released on 2020-10-16.

DESCRIPTION
    See included script cek-bpom.

FUNCTIONS
  cek_bpom
    Usage:

     cek_bpom(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Search BPOM products via https://cekbpom.pom.go.id/.

    Examples:

    *   By default search against name (nama_produk) and brand (merk):

         cek_bpom( queries => ["hichew", "hi-chew", "hi chew"]);

    Uses LWP::UserAgent::Plugin so you can add retry, caching, or additional
    HTTP client behavior by setting "LWP_USERAGENT_PLUGINS" environment
    variable.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   queries* => *array[str]*

    *   search_types => *array[str]*

        Select what field(s) to search against.

        By default, if not specified, will search against product name
        ("nama_produk") and brand ("merk"). If you specify multiple times,
        it will search against all those types, e.g.:

         --search-type nama_produk --search-type nama_pendaftar

        or:

         --nama-produk --nama-pendaftar

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
