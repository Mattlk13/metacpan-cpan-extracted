NAME
    App::CekBpom - Check BPOM products via the command-line (CLI interface
    for cekbpom.pom.go.id)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.010 of App::CekBpom (from Perl
    distribution App-CekBpom), released on 2020-10-22.

DESCRIPTION
    See included script cek-bpom.

FUNCTIONS
  cek_bpom
    Usage:

     cek_bpom(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Search BPOM products via https://cekbpom.pom.go.id/.

    Examples:

    *   By default search against name (nama_produk) and brand (merk):

         cek_bpom( queries => ["hichew", "hi-chew", "hi chew"]);

    Uses LWP::UserAgent::Plugin so you can add retry, caching, or additional
    HTTP client behavior by setting "LWP_USERAGENT_PLUGINS" environment
    variable.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   note => *str*

        Add note.

        This will not be sent as queries, but will be added to the log file
        if log file is specified, as well as added to the result dump file
        name, in encoded form.

    *   queries* => *array[str]*

    *   query_log_file => *filename*

        Log queries to log file.

        If specified, each invocation of this utility will be logged into a
        line in the specified file path, in TSV format. Tab character in the
        query will be converted into 4 spaces, to avoid clash with the use
        of Tab as field separator.

        For example, this invocation:

         % cek-bpom "minuman susu fermentasi" yakult --query-log-file /some/path.txt

        Sample log line:

         time:2020-10-22T01:02:03.000Z    queries:minuman susu fermentasi,yakult    search_types:merk,nama_produk    num_results:51    duration:3.402

    *   result_dump_dir => *dirname*

        Dump result to directory.

        If specified, will dump full enveloped result to a file in specified
        directory path, in JSON format. The JSON formatting makes it easy to
        grep each row. The file will be named
        "cek-bpom-result.<encoded-timestamp>.<search-types-encoded>.<queries
        -encoded>(.<note-encoded>)?.json". The encoded timestamp is ISO 8601
        format with colon replaced by underscore. The encoded query will
        replace all every group of "unsafe" characters in query with a
        single dash. The same goes with encoded note, which comes from the
        "note" argument. For example, this invocation:

         % cek-bpom "minuman susu fermentasi" yakult --note "some note"

        will result in a result dump file name like:
        "cek-bpom-result.2020-10-22T01_02_03.000Z.merk-nama_produk.minuman-s
        usu-fermentasi-yakult.some-note.json".

    *   search_types => *array[str]*

        Select what field(s) to search against.

        By default, if not specified, will search against product name
        ("nama_produk") and brand ("merk"). If you specify multiple times,
        it will search against all those types, e.g.:

         --search-type nama_produk --search-type nama_pendaftar

        or:

         --nama-produk --nama-pendaftar

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
