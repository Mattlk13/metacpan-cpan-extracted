DESCRIPTION
    PERLANCAR describing modules badly.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Path::Tiny

        When you're bored and want to relearn crawling, standing up, walking
        and speech all over again when dealing with files.

    *   M

        Remember when you want to have more than four ways to do OO, but
        less than six? Yeah, me neither.

         (To be honest, I've used all L<Moose>, L<Mouse>, L<Moo>,
        and L<Mo> for "real-world" purposes, and Mo is so lightweight the only way to
        be more lightweight is to do bare OO by yourself.)

    *   Dist::Zilla

        An ideal distribution builder tool, particularly if you need to
        develop dzil plugin distributions.

FAQ
  What are ways to use this module?
    Aside from reading it, you can install all the listed modules using
    cpanmodules:

        % cpanmodules ls-entries DescribeAModuleBadly::PERLANCAR | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=DescribeAModuleBadly::PERLANCAR -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful result for "lcpan
    related-mods" when it comes to finding related modules for the modules
    listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
