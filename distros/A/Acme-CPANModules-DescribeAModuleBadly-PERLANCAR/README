        Remember when you want to have more than four ways to do OO, but
        less than six? Yeah, me neither.

         (To be honest, I've used all L<Moose>, L<Mouse>, L<Moo>, and L<Mo> for
        "real-world" purposes, and Mo is so lightweight the only way to be more
        lightweight is to do bare OO by yourself.)

    Dist::Zilla
        Author: RJBS <https://metacpan.org/author/RJBS>

        An ideal distribution builder tool, particularly if you need to
        develop Dist::Zilla plugin distributions.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
