NAME
    App::arraydata - Show content of ArrayData modules (plus a few other
    things)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::arraydata (from Perl
    distribution App-arraydata), released on 2021-06-11.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script arraydata.

FUNCTIONS
  arraydata
    Usage:

     arraydata(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Show content of ArrayData modules (plus a few other things).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action => *str* (default: "dump")

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   module => *perl::arraydata::modname_with_optional_args*

    *   num => *posint* (default: 1)

        Number of elements to pick (for -R).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
