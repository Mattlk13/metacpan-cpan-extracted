FUNCTIONS
  pmdir
    Usage:

     pmdir(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Get directory of locally installed Perl module/prefix.

    This is basically a shortcut for:

     % pmpath -Pd MODULE_OR_PREFIX_NAME

    Sometimes I forgot that pmpath has a "-d" option, and often intuitively
    look for a pmdir command.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   abs => *bool*

        Absolutify each path.

    *   module* => *array[perl::modname]*

    *   pm => *int* (default: 1)

    *   pmc => *int* (default: 0)

    *   pod => *int* (default: 0)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  pmpath
    Usage:

     pmpath(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Get path to locally installed Perl module.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   abs => *bool*

        Absolutify each path.

    *   all => *bool*

        Return all found files for each module instead of the first one.

    *   dir => *bool*

        Show directory instead of path.

        Also, will return "." if not found, so you can conveniently do this
        on a Unix shell:

         % cd C<pmpath -Pd Moose>

        and it won't change directory if the module doesn't exist.

    *   module* => *array[perl::modname]*

    *   pm => *int* (default: 1)

    *   pmc => *int* (default: 0)

    *   pod => *int* (default: 0)

    *   prefix => *int* (default: 0)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  rel2mod
    Usage:

     rel2mod(%args) -> any

    Convert release name (e.g. Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz) to module name
    (Foo::Bar).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   releases* => *array[str]*

    Return value: (any)

FAQ
  What is the purpose of this distribution? Haven't other similar utilities existed?
    For example, mpath from Module::Path distribution is similar to pmpath
    in App::PMUtils, and mversion from Module::Version distribution is
    similar to pmversion from App::PMUtils distribution, and so on.

    True. The main point of these utilities is shell tab completion, to save
    typing.
