=head1 NAME

pmdir - Get directory of locally installed Perl module/prefix

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.730 of pmdir (from Perl distribution App-PMUtils), released on 2020-01-31.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is basically a shortcut for:

 % pmpath -Pd MODULE_OR_PREFIX_NAME

It's just that sometimes I forgot that L<pmpath> has a C<-d> option, and
often intuitively look for a C<pmdir> command.

Basic usage:

 % cd `pmdir Pod::Weaver`

Works with prefix too:

 % cd `pmdir Dist::Zilla::Plugin`
 % cd `pmdir Dist::Zilla::Plugin::`

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for BEGIN_BLOCK: protip_cdpm

Pro-tip: install this bash function to be able to cd quickly to directory of
Perl module/prefix (tab completion is also provided):

 # function definition
 cdpm ()
 {
     if [[ "$1" = "" ]]; then echo "Please specify a Perl module/prefix name"; return; fi
     local dir=`pmdir "$1"`
     if [[ "$dir" = "" ]]; then echo "Failed"; else cd "$dir"; fi
 }
 
 # tab completion
 _cdpm ()
 {
     local cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
     COMPREPLY=( `COMP_LINE="pmdir $cur" COMP_POINT=$[6+${#cur}] pmdir` )
 }
 
 # activate tab completion
 complete -F _cdpm cdpm

Afterwards, you can:

 % cdpm di/zi/pl<tab>
 % cdpm Dist/Zilla/Plugin/ _

=for END_BLOCK: protip_cdpm

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--abs>, B<-P>

Absolutify each path.

=item B<--module-json>=I<s>

See C<--module>.

=item B<--module>=I<s@>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--pm>=I<s>

Default value:

 1

=item B<--pmc>=I<s>

Default value:

 0

=item B<--pod>=I<s>

Default value:

 0

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pmdir pmdir

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pmdir 'p/*/`pmdir`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
