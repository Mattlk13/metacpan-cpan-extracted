=head1 NAME

pmlines - Count number of {code,POD} lines in a Perl module

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.744 of pmlines (from Perl distribution App-PMUtils), released on 2023-05-12.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % pmlines HTTP::Tiny LWP::UserAgent
 +-------+------+---------+----------------+-----+-------+
 | blank | code | comment | module         | pod | total |
 | 482   | 988  | 276     | HTTP::Tiny     | 686 | 2136  |
 | 417   | 844  | 68      | LWP::UserAgent | 807 | 1861  |
 +-------+------+---------+----------------+-----+-------+

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility uses L<SourceCode::LineCounter::Perl> to count lines of
{code,POD,blank,comment} in a specified module.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--module-json>=I<s>

See C<--module>.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

=item B<--module>=I<s@>

(No description)


Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pmlines pmlines

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pmlines 'p/*/`pmlines`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 HOMEPAGE

=head1 SOURCE

Source repository is at L<https://github.com/perlancar/perl-App-PMUtils>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<App::cloc> which uses the B<cloc> program and can output number of
{code,blank,comment} lines in a Perl source code (as well as other languages).
Results might differ slightly with result from this utility.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-PMUtils>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
