NAME
    App::xsum - Compute and check file checksums/digests (using various
    algorithms)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of App::xsum (from Perl
    distribution App-xsum), released on 2019-09-12.

SYNOPSIS
    See xsum.

FUNCTIONS
  xsum
    Usage:

     xsum(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Compute and check file checksums/digests (using various algorithms).

    "xsum" is a handy small utility that can be used as an
    alternative/replacement for the individual per-algorithm Unix utilities
    like "md5sum", "sha1sum", "sha224sum", and so on. It's basically the
    same as said Unix utilities but you can use a single command instead.

    The backend of "xsum" is a Perl module File::Digest which in turn
    delegates to the individual per-algorithm backend like Digest::MD5,
    Digest::SHA, and so on. Most of the backend modules are written in C/XS
    so you don't suffer significant performance decrease.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str*

        In addition to "md5", "sha1" or the other algorithms, you can also
        specify "Digest" to use Perl's Digest module. This gives you access
        to tens of other digest modules, for example Digest::BLAKE2 (see
        examples).

        When "--digest-args" ("-A") is not specified, algorithm defaults to
        "md5". But if "--digest-args" ("-A") is specified, algorithm
        defaults to "Digest", for convenience.

    *   check => *bool*

        Read checksum from files and check them.

    *   checksums => *array[str]*

        Supply checksum(s).

    *   digest_args => *array[str]*

        If you use "Digest" as the algorithm, you can pass arguments for the
        Digest module here.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

    *   tag => *bool*

        Create a BSD-style checksum.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
