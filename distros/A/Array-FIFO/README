NAME

    Array::FIFO - A Simple limitable FIFO array, with sum and average
    methods

VERSION

    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS

        my $ar = Array::FIFO->new( limit => 12 );
        $ar->add( 20 );
        $ar->add( 18 );
        $ar->add( 22 );
    
        say $ar->average;

DESCRIPTION

    Array::FIFO is meant to be a simple limitable array, for storing data
    in a FIFO manner; with an optional limit to how large the array can
    get. When the limit is reached, the oldest value is returned by add
    when new values are added.

    It's intent is for numeric values (i.e. current load of a system), but
    it should work for other data types if you're not in need of the
    calculation methods.

    The sum and average methods return the current sum and average of the
    data as you would expect. It does this on once, then caches the result
    until the array changes.

METHODS

 new

    limit (optional)

      Numeric value of how large the array is allowed to get. When it
      reaches limit, every item added causes the oldest item to be removed.

      If no value is passed, there is no max size.

 add

        $ar->add( 99 );

    You can add any type of item to the array; if it's not a number it will
    be treated as a value of 0 when when calculating sum() and average().

    Returns the oldest element in the array.

 remove

        $ar->remove;

    Remove the oldest item on the array.

 queue

        $ar->queue;

    Reference directly the fifo array.

 size

        $ar->size;

    How many elements are in the array.

 limit

        $ar->limit;

    The maximum size the array is allowed to be.

 sum

        $ar->sum;

    The sum of all numeric elements in the array.

 average

        $ar->average;

    The average of all numeric elements in the array.
