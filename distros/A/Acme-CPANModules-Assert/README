NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Assert - Assertion

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::Assert (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Assert), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Assertion.

    Assertion is a check statement that must evaluate to true or it will
    abort program's execution. It is useful during development/debugging:

     assert("there must be >3 arguments", sub { @args > 3 });

    In production code, compilers ideally do not generate code for assertion
    statements so they do not have any impact on runtime performance.

    In the old days, you only have this alternative to do it in Perl:

     assert(...) if DEBUG;

    where "DEBUG" is a constant subroutine, declared using:

     use constant DEBUG => 0;

    or:

     sub DEBUG() { 0 }

    The perl compiler will optimize away and remove the code entirely when
    "DEBUG" is false. But having to add "if DEBUG" to each assertion is
    annoying and error-prone.

    Nowadays, you have several alternatives to have a true, C-like
    assertions. One technique is using Devel::Declare (e.g. PerlX::Assert).
    Another technique is using B::CallChecker (e.g. Assert::Conditional).
