NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Assert - List of modules to do assertion

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::Assert (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Assert), released on 2022-03-08.

DESCRIPTION
    Assertion is a check statement that must evaluate to true or it will
    abort program's execution. It is useful during development/debugging:

     assert("there must be >3 arguments", sub { @args > 3 });

    In production code, compilers ideally do not generate code for assertion
    statements so they do not have any impact on runtime performance.

    In the old days, you only have this alternative to do it in Perl:

     assert(...) if DEBUG;

    where "DEBUG" is a constant subroutine, declared using:

     use constant DEBUG => 0;

    or:

     sub DEBUG() { 0 }

    The perl compiler will optimize away and remove the code entirely when
    "DEBUG" is false. But having to add "if DEBUG" to each assertion is
    annoying and error-prone.

    Nowadays, you have several alternatives to have a true, C-like
    assertions. One technique is using Devel::Declare (e.g. PerlX::Assert).
    Another technique is using B::CallChecker (e.g. Assert::Conditional).

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Assert

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Assert | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=Assert -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Assert -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Assert::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
