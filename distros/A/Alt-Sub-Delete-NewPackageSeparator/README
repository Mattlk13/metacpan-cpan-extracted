NAME
    Alt::Sub::Delete::NewPackageSeparator - Alternate implementation of
    Sub::Delete which replaces the old package separator with new

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.000022 of
    Alt::Sub::Delete::NewPackageSeparator (from Perl distribution
    Alt-Sub-Delete-NewPackageSeparator), released on 2023-12-04.

DESCRIPTION
    As of this writing, Sub::Delete (v1.00002) still uses the old package
    separator ("'" instead of "::") which triggers a deprecation warning
    under perl 5.38+. This distribution includes an alternate Sub::Delete
    which replaces the use of old package separator with new.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
