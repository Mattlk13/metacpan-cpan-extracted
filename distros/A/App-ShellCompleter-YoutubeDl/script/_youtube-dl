=head1 NAME

_youtube-dl - Shell completer for youtube-dl

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.123 of _youtube-dl (from Perl distribution App-ShellCompleter-YoutubeDl), released on 2021-09-07.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To install, install the CPAN distribution this command comes in with, and then
in your bash (and/or bash startup file):

 complete -C _youtube-dl youtube-dl

or, you can use L<shcompgen> to do that for you automatically.

Now L<youtube-dl> has bash completion:

 % youtube-dl --no-pl<tab>
 % youtube-dl --external-downloader c<tab>

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
