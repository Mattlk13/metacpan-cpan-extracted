NAME
    App::Spanel::BuildBindZonesFromPowerDNSDB - Build BIND zones from
    PowerDNS zones in database

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    App::Spanel::BuildBindZonesFromPowerDNSDB (from Perl distribution
    App-Spanel-BuildBindZonesFromPowerDNSDB), released on 2019-08-29.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included spanel-build-bind-zones script.

FUNCTIONS
  build_bind_zones
    Usage:

     build_bind_zones(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Build BIND zones from PowerDNS zones in database.

    This script will export domains in your PowerDNS database as BIND zones
    then write them to the current directory with names
    <servername>/db.<domainname> (so "example.com" from "server123" will be
    written to "./server123/db.example.com").

    Will not override existing files unless "--overwrite" ("-O") is
    specified.

    You can select domains to export using "include-domain" option.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   db_dsn => *str* (default: "DBI:mysql:database=pdns")

    *   db_password => *str*

    *   db_user => *str*

    *   default_ns => *array[net::hostname]*

    *   domain_id => *uint*

    *   exclude_servers => *array[net::hostname]*

    *   include_domains => *array[net::hostname]*

    *   include_servers => *array[net::hostname]*

    *   overwrite => *bool*

        Whether to overwrite existing output files.

    *   workaround_cname_and_other_data => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to avoid having CNAME record for a name as well as other
        record types.

        This is a workaround for a common misconfiguration in PowerDNS DB.
        Bind will reject the whole zone if there is CNAME record for a name
        (e.g. 'www') as well as other record types (e.g. 'A' or 'TXT'). The
        workaround is to skip those A/TXT records and only keep the CNAME
        record.

    *   workaround_no_ns => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to add some NS records for '' when there are no NS records
        for it.

        This is a workaround for a common misconfiguration in PowerDNS DB.
        This will add some NS records specified in "default_ns".

    *   workaround_root_cname => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to avoid having CNAME record for a name as well as other
        record types.

        CNAME on a root node (host='') does not make sense, so the
        workaround is to ignore the root CNAME.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
