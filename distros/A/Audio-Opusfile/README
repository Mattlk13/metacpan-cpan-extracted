Audio-Opusfile version 1.000
============================

Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.
Opus is unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission over
the Internet, but is also intended for storage and streaming
applications. It is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) as RFC 6716 which incorporated technology from Skype's
SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.

libopusfile is a library for decoding and basic manipulation of Ogg
Opus files.

Audio::Opusfile is an interface to libopusfile. It exports nearly all
of the functions for obtaining metadata of an Opus file or buffer in
that library. Future versions will additionally provide functions for
decoding Opus data into PCM.

The API might change in future versions.
