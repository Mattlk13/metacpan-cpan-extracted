=head1 NAME

diff-xls-text - Diff the text of two Office spreadsheets (.ods, .xls, .xlsx) as two directories of CSV files

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.011 of diff-xls-text (from Perl distribution App-DiffXlsText), released on 2022-09-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use the Unix command B<diff>:

 % diff-xls-text [options] <FILE>...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a wrapper for the Unix command B<diff>. It assumes that each input file
is an Office spreadsheet (.ods, .xls, or .xlsx) and tries to convert the file to
a directory of CSV files (where each CSV file is converted from a single
worksheet) using L<xlsx2csv>. It then passes the converted directories to C<<
diff -ruN >> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

These are options that are interpreted by B<diff-xls-text> and not passed to
B<diff>.

B<Please specify these options before file names.>

=over

=item * --transpose-csv

Transpose CSV first using L<csv-transpose> from L<App::CSVUtils>. This allows
you to do column-based instead of row-based diff.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG

If set to true, do not cleanup temporary directories.

=head2 DIFF_CMD

String. Can be used to set path to diff command. See also
L</DIFF_XLS_TEXT_DIFF_CMD> which takes precedence.

=head2 DIFF_XLS_TEXT_DIFF_CMD

String. Can be used to set path to diff command. The defaultl is L<diffwc> if
available in PATH, or C<diff>. Takes precedence over L</DIFF_CMD>.

=head1 HOMEPAGE

Please visit the project's homepage at L<https://metacpan.org/release/App-DiffXlsText>.

=head1 SOURCE

Source repository is at L<https://github.com/perlancar/perl-App-DiffXlsText>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Unix command L<diff>.

L<ssdiff> from L<Spreadsheet::Read> which also diffs two spreadsheets but
presents the result differently.

L<xlsx2csv> from L<Spreadsheet::Read>

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-DiffXlsText>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
