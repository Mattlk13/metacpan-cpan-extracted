NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::TemporaryChdir - List of modules to change directory
    temporarily

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::TemporaryChdir (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-TemporaryChdir), released on 2023-12-15.

DESCRIPTION
    Changing directory can be tricky if you are doing it in a transaction or
    inside a routine where you need to restore the previous working
    directory whether your main action succeeds or not. Forgetting doing it
    and it will cause unexpected behavior for the user calling your code.

    Restoring previous directory can be as simple as:

     use Cwd qw(getcwd);
 
     my $prevcwd = getcwd();
     eval {
         # do some stuffs that might die ...
     };
     # check success status ...
     chdir $prevcwd or die "Can't chdir back to '$prevcwd': $!";

    but it can get tedious. Some modules can help. These modules employ one
    of several mechanisms provided by Perl:

    1) Tied scalar, where reading from the scalar retrieves the current
    working directory and writing to it changes the working directory. The
    user can set the magic variable locally and have Perl restore the old
    value. Modules that use this technique include: File::chdir.

    2) An object, where its constructor records the current working
    directory and its DESTROY restores the previously recorded working
    directory. The user can create a lexically scoped object that can change
    directory but restores the previous working directory when the object
    goes out of scope. Modules that use this technique include: File::pushd
    and Dir::TempChdir.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n TemporaryChdir

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries TemporaryChdir | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=TemporaryChdir -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::TemporaryChdir -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::TemporaryChdir::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
