ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    Docopt
        Author: TOKUHIROM <https://metacpan.org/author/TOKUHIROM>

    Getopt::ArgParse
        Author: MYTRAM <https://metacpan.org/author/MYTRAM>

    PSGI
        Author: MIYAGAWA <https://metacpan.org/author/MIYAGAWA>

        From Plack's documentation: "Plack is like Ruby's Rack or Python's
        Paste for WSGI." Plack and PSGI were created by MIYAGAWA in 2009 and
        were inspired by both Python's WSGI specification (hence the dual
        specification-implementation split) and Ruby's Plack (hence the
        name).

    Data::XLSX::Parser
        Author: ACIDLEMON <https://metacpan.org/author/ACIDLEMON>

        Quoted from the module's documentation: "The implementation of this
        module is highly inspired from Python's FastXLSX library."

    Dash
        Author: PABLROD <https://metacpan.org/author/PABLROD>

        From the module's documentation: "This package is a port of Plotly's
        Dash to Perl. Dash makes building analytical web applications very
        easy. No JavaScript required."

    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?

    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n PortedFrom::Python

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries PortedFrom::Python | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=PortedFrom::Python -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
