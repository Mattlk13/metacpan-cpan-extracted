NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::KitchenSinks - Kitchen sink libraries

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::KitchenSinks
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-KitchenSinks), released on
    2021-07-26.

DESCRIPTION
    A "kitchen sink" module is a module that tries to provide all sorts of
    functions/methods for various things. It often starts as a developer's
    personal "general utilities" library that grows and grows to the point
    of "it should probably be refactored into multiple modules (but isn't
    yet)". Often it also contains functionalities that are already present
    in other modules, but added into the module anyway because it is
    convenient for the developer.

    This list catalogs modules that I think are kitchen sink libraries.
