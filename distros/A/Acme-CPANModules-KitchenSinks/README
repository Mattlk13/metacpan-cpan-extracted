NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::KitchenSinks - List of kitchen sink libraries

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::KitchenSinks
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-KitchenSinks), released on
    2022-02-04.

DESCRIPTION
    A "kitchen sink" module is a module that tries to provide all sorts of
    functions/methods for various things. It often starts as a developer's
    personal "general utilities" library that grows and grows to the point
    of "it should probably be refactored into multiple modules (but isn't
    yet)". Often it also contains functionalities that are already present
    in other modules, but added into the module anyway because it is
    convenient for the developer.

    This list catalogs modules that I think are kitchen sink libraries.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
