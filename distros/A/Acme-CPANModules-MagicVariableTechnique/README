NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::MagicVariableTechnique - Modules which employ magic
    variable technique to do stuffs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::MagicVariableTechnique (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-MagicVariableTechnique), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules which employ magic variable technique to do stuffs.

    This is a list of modules which provide some "magic" variable which you
    can get/set to perform stuffs. I personally find this technique is
    mostly useful to "temporarily set" stuffs, by combining it with Perl's
    "local()".

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   File::chdir

        Provides $CWD which you can use to change directory. By doing:

         local $CWD = ...;

        in a subroutine or block, you can safely change directory
        temporarily without messing current directory and breaking code in
        other parts. Very handy and convenient.

        This is the first module I found/use where I realized the technique.
        Since then I've been looking for other modules using similar
        technique, and have even created a few myself.

    *   File::umask

        Provides $UMASK to get/set umask.

    *   Umask::Local

        Like File::umask, but instead of using a tied variable, uses an
        object with its "DESTROY" method restoring original umask. I find
        the interface a bit more awkward.

        Alternate modules: File::umask

    *   Locale::Tie

        Provides $LANG, $LC_ALL, $LC_TIME, and few others to let you
        (temporarily) set locale settings.

    *   Locale::Scope

        Like Locale::Tie, but instead of using a tied variable, uses an
        object with its "DESTROY" method restoring original settings.
