NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::MagicVariableTechnique - List of modules which employ
    magic variable technique to do stuffs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::MagicVariableTechnique (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-MagicVariableTechnique), released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a list of modules which provide some "magic" variable which you
    can get/set to perform stuffs. I personally find this technique is
    mostly useful to "temporarily set" stuffs, by combining it with Perl's
    local().

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    File::chdir
        Author: DAGOLDEN <https://metacpan.org/author/DAGOLDEN>

        Provides $CWD which you can use to change directory. By doing:

         local $CWD = ...;

        in a subroutine or block, you can safely change directory
        temporarily without messing current directory and breaking code in
        other parts. Very handy and convenient.

        This is the first module I found/use where I realized the technique.
        Since then I've been looking for other modules using similar
        technique, and have even created a few myself.

    File::umask
        Author: SHARYANTO <https://metacpan.org/author/SHARYANTO>

        Provides $UMASK to get/set umask.

    Umask::Local
        Author: ROUZIER <https://metacpan.org/author/ROUZIER>

        Like File::umask, but instead of using a tied variable, uses an
        object with its "DESTROY" method restoring original umask. I find
        the interface a bit more awkward.

        Alternate modules: File::umask

    Locale::Tie
        Author: PERLANCAR <https://metacpan.org/author/PERLANCAR>

        Provides $LANG, $LC_ALL, $LC_TIME, and few others to let you
        (temporarily) set locale settings.

    Locale::Scope
        Author: KARUPA <https://metacpan.org/author/KARUPA>

        Like Locale::Tie, but instead of using a tied variable, uses an
        object with its "DESTROY" method restoring original settings.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n MagicVariableTechnique

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries MagicVariableTechnique | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=MagicVariableTechnique -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::MagicVariableTechnique -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::MagicVariableTechnique::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
