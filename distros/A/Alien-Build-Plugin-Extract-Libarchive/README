NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Extract::Libarchive - Alien::Build plugin to
    extract a tarball using libarchive

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     use alienfile;
    
     share {
       ...
       plugin 'Extract::Libarchive';
       ...
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Alien::Build extract plugin that uses libarchive via
    Archive::Libarchive::Extract and Archive::Libarchive. Its main
    advantage is that it supports a wider array of archive formats than
    existing plugins, and doesn't require that you specify a format.
    (libarchive is typically smart enough to be able to detect the format).

    Its main disadvantage is extended build time, due to the number of
    formats it supports it has a number of dependencies (both Perl and
    external). It should however, build on most modern systems using Alien
    technology if the system does not provide its own libarchive.
