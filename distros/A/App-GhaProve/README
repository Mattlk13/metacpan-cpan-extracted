NAME
    App::GhaProve - guts for the gha-prove command

SYNOPSIS
    From command-line:

      $ gha-prove -b -r -v 't'
      ...

    In script:

      use App::GhaProve;
      my @args = qw( -b -r -v t );
      my $exit = 'App::GhaProve'->go( @args );
      exit( $exit );

    With a callback (instead of `CORE::system`):

      use App::GhaProve;
      my @args = qw( -b -r -v t );
      my $exit = 'App::GhaProve'->go( sub { ... }, @args );
      exit( $exit );

DESCRIPTION
    `gha-prove` is just a small wrapper around the `prove` command. It will
    inspect `GHA_*` environment variables and this will affect how it calls
    `prove`, perhaps calling `prove` multiple times. It is intended to be used
    in continuous integration environments, such as GitHub Actions.

    Setting `$App::GhaProve::QUIET = 1` will suppress additional output from
    App::GhaProve, showing only output from `prove`. (There is very little
    output from App::GhaProve anyway.)

ENVIRONMENT
    `GHA_TESTING_COVER=1` or `GHA_TESTING_COVER=true`
        Turn on Devel::Cover.

    `GHA_TESTING_MODE=0` or `GHA_TESTING_MODE=standard`
        Run test suite without EXTENDED_TESTING.

    `GHA_TESTING_MODE=1` or `GHA_TESTING_MODE=extended`
        Run test suite with EXTENDED_TESTING=1.

    `GHA_TESTING_MODE=2` or `GHA_TESTING_MODE=both`
        Run test suite twice, using each of the above.
