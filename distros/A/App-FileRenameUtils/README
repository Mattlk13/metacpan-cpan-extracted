    distribution App-FileRenameUtils), released on 2023-03-19.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

    1. move-files-here
    2. mv-add-prefix
    3. mv-add-prefix-datestamp
    4. mv-add-prefix-number
    5. mv-reverse
    6. mv-swap
    7. mv-to-from
    8. rename-add-prefix
    9. rename-add-prefix-datestamp
    10. rename-add-prefix-number
    11. rename-swap
    12. rename-to-from

FUNCTIONS
  add_filename_suffix
    Usage:

     $new_name = add_filename_suffix($filename, $suffix);

    Examples:

     add_filename_suffix("foo.jpg", " (1)"); # -> "foo (1).jpg"
     add_filename_suffix("foo", " (1)"); # -> "foo (1)"

  find_unique_filename
    Usage:

     $new_name = find_unique_filename($filename);

    Continue adding suffix " (1)", " (2)", and so on to $filename (see
    "add_filename_suffix") until the new name does not exist on the
    filesystem. If $filename already does not exist, it will be returned
    as-is.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
