    App::FileRenameUtils - Utilities related to renaming/moving files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of App::FileRenameUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-FileRenameUtils), released on 2020-08-22.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   move-files-here

    *   mv-reverse

    *   rename-add-prefix

    *   rename-swap

    *   rename-to-from

FUNCTIONS
  add_filename_suffix
    Usage:

     $new_name = add_filename_suffix($filename, $suffix);

    Examples:

     add_filename_suffix("foo.jpg", " (1)"); # -> "foo (1).jpg"
     add_filename_suffix("foo", " (1)"); # -> "foo (1)"

  find_unique_filename
    Usage:

     $new_name = find_unique_filename($filename);

    Continue adding suffix " (1)", " (2)", and so on to $filename (see
    "add_filename_suffix") until the new name does not exist on the
    filesystem. If $filename already does not exist, it will be returned
    as-is.
