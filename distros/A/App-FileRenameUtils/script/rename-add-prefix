=head1 NAME

rename-add-prefix - Add prefix to filenames

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.014 of rename-add-prefix (from Perl distribution App-FileRenameUtils), released on 2023-11-20.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % rename-add-prefix <prefix> <file>...

Given these files:

 foo
 bar.txt
 new-baz.mp4

this command:

 % rename-add-prefix new- *

will rename them as follow:

 foo -> new-foo
 bar.txt -> new-bar.txt

F<new-baz.mp4> is not renamed because it already has the C<new-> prefix.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a shortcut for:

 % perlmv add-prefix -a avoid_duplicate_prefix=1 -a prefix=<prefix> <file>...

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
