=head1 NAME

rename-to-from - Rename a file, with reversed order of arguments

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.007 of rename-to-from (from Perl distribution App-FileRenameUtils), released on 2023-02-27.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % rename-to-from <new-filename> <current-filename>
 % mv-reverse     <new-filename> <current-filename>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is handy if you happen to just rename a file that has a long name:

 % mv some-rather-long-file-name.txt some-other-name

and made a mistake and want to reverse the previous operation:

 % rename-to-from some-rather-long-file-name.txt some-other-name

or:

 % mv-reverse     some-rather-long-file-name.txt some-other-name

On the command-line, you just press Ctrl-A (or some other equivalent shortcut to
move to the start of line) and replace C<mv> with C<rename-to-from> (or
C<mv-reverse>).

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
