=head1 NAME

rename-to-from - Rename a file, with reversed order of arguments

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.006 of rename-to-from (from Perl distribution App-FileRenameUtils), released on 2020-08-22.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % rename-to-from <new-filename> <current-filename>
 % mv-reverse     <new-filename> <current-filename>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is handy if you happen to just rename a file that has a long name:

 % mv some-rather-long-file-name.txt some-other-name

and made a mistake and want to reverse the previous operation:

 % rename-to-from some-rather-long-file-name.txt some-other-name

or:

 % mv-reverse     some-rather-long-file-name.txt some-other-name

On the command-line, you just press Ctrl-A (or some other equivalent shortcut to
move to the start of line) and replace C<mv> with C<rename-to-from> (or
C<mv-reverse>).
