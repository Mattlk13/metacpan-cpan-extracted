=head1 NAME

rename-swap - Swap filenames

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.012 of rename-swap (from Perl distribution App-FileRenameUtils), released on 2023-11-15.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Swapping two files:

 % rename-swap f1 f2

f1 will be renamed to f2 while f2 will be renamed to f1.

Swapping three files:

 % rename-swap f1 f2 f3

f1 will be renamed to f3, f3 will be renamed to f1, while f2 will be unchanged.

Swapping four files:

 % rename-swap f1 f2 f3 f4

f1 will be renamed to f4, f4 will be renamed to f1, f2 will be renamed to f3, f3
will be renamed to f2.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WARNING: Be careful when running this script. This script does not support
dry-run (simulation) mode nor undo. It uses C<rename()> so it does not support
moving files across filesystems; it's best to specify only files in the same
directory.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-FileRenameUtils>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
