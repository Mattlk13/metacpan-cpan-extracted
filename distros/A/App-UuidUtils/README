VERSION
    This document describes version 0.031 of App::UuidUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-UuidUtils), released on 2021-05-06.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains command-line utilities related to UUIDs:

    *   gen-uuid

FUNCTIONS
  gen_uuid
    Usage:

     gen_uuid(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Generate UUID, with several options.

    This utility is meant to generate one or several UUIDs with several
    options, like "version", backend, etc.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   backend => *str*

        Choose a specific backend, if unspecified one will be chosen.

        Note that not all backends support every version of UUID.

    *   num => *int* (default: 1)

    *   uuid_version => *str* (default: "random")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
