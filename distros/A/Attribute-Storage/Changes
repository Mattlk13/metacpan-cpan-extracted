         * Added ability to apply, query, and find attributes on scalar, array

         * Use `meta` to simplify internals previously built using
           `no strict 'refs'`
         * Swapped unit tests from `Test::More` to `Test2::V0`
         * Avoid test-time dependency on `Test::NoWarnings`

0.08    BUGFIXES:

           works, even from other packages
         * Ensure that multi-line attribute definitions work

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Use Magic to implement value storage behind CVs so that destruction
           correctly frees old values on code reload or dropping anonymous
