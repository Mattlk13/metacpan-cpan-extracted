Although a directory (top-level directory of an extracted Perl distribution) can
be analyzed, distribution Kwalitee is supposed to be calculated on a
distribution archive file (e.g. tarball) because there are metrics like
`extractable`, `extracts_nicely`, `no_pax_headers` which can only be tested on a
distribution archive file. Running this on a directory will result in a
less-than-full score.

=head1 NAME

App::KwaliteeUtils - Utilities related to Kwalitee

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.003 of App::KwaliteeUtils (from Perl distribution App-KwaliteeUtils), released on 2021-05-25.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

=over

=item * L<calc-kwalitee>

=back

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 calc_kwalitee

Usage:

 calc_kwalitee(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

Calculate kwalitee of a local distribution.

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<dist> => I<pathname> (default: ".")

Distribution archive file (e.g. tarball) or directory.

Although a directory (top-level directory of an extracted Perl distribution) can
be analyzed, distribution Kwalitee is supposed to be calculated on a
distribution archive file (e.g. tarball) because there are metrics like
C<extractable>, C<extracts_nicely>, C<no_pax_headers> which can only be tested on a
distribution archive file. Running this on a directory will result in a
less-than-full score.

=item * B<raw> => I<true>


=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information.

Return value:  (any)
