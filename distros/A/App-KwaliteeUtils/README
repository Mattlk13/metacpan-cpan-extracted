NAME
    App::KwaliteeUtils - Utilities related to Kwalitee

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::KwaliteeUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-KwaliteeUtils), released on 2019-07-03.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   calc-kwalitee

FUNCTIONS
  calc_kwalitee
    Usage:

     calc_kwalitee(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Calculate kwalitee of a local distribution.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dist => *pathname* (default: ".")

        Distribution archive file (e.g. tarball) or directory.

        Although a directory (top-level directory of an extracted Perl
        distribution) can be analyzed, distribution Kwalitee is supposed to
        be calculated on a distribution archive file (e.g. tarball) because
        there are metrics like "extractable", "extracts_nicely",
        "no_pax_headers" which can only be tested on a distribution archive
        file. Running this on a directory will result in a less-than-full
        score.

    *   raw => *true*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
