NAME
    App::column::run - Run several commands and show their output in
    multiple columns

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::column::run (from Perl
    distribution App-column-run), released on 2020-06-06.

FUNCTIONS
  column_run
    Usage:

     column_run(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Run several commands and show their output in multiple columns.

    This utility is similar to using the Unix utility pr to columnate
    output, something like (in bash):

     % pr -t -m -w $COLUMNS -l 99999 <(command1 args...) <(command2 args...)

    except with the following features:

    *   ANSI color and wide character handling

    *   passing adjusted COLUMNS environment to commands so they can adjust
        output

    *   Passing common arguments to all commands

    *   Multiplexing STDIN to all commands

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   args => *array[str]*

        Common arguments to pass to each program.

    *   commands* => *array[str]*

    *   linum_width => *posint*

        Line number width.

    *   on_long_line => *str* (default: "clip")

        What to do to long lines.

    *   separator => *str* (default: "|")

        Separator character between columns.

    *   show_linum => *bool*

        Show line number.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
