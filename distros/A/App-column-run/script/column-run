=head1 NAME

column-run - Run several commands and show their output in multiple columns

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of column-run (from Perl distribution App-column-run), released on 2020-06-06.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % column-run [--arg=s+] [--args-json=s] [--command=s+] [--commands-json=s]
     [--linum-width=s] [--no-show-linum] [--noshow-linum]
     [--on-long-line=s] [--page-result[=program]] [--separator=s]
     [--show-linum] [--view-result[=program]] [--wrap] <command> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is similar to using the Unix utility L<pr> to columnate output,
something like (in bash):

 % pr -t -m -w $COLUMNS -l 99999 <(command1 args...) <(command2 args...)

except with the following features:

=over

=item * ANSI color and wide character handling

=item * passing adjusted COLUMNS environment to commands so they can adjust output

=item * Passing common arguments to all commands

=item * Multiplexing STDIN to all commands

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C column-run column-run

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete column-run 'p/*/`column-run`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
