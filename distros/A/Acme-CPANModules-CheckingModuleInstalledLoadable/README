NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable - Checking if a
    module is installed or loadable

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable (from Perl
    distribution Acme-CPANModules-CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable), released
    on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Checking if a module is installed or loadable.

    If you simply want to check that a module's ".pm" file is locatable in
    @INC, you can just do something like:

     my $mod = "Foo/Bar.pm";
     for my $dir (@INC) {
         next if ref $dir;
         if (-f "$dir/$mod") {
             print "Module $mod is installed";
             last;
         }
     }

    Or you can use something like Module::Path or Module::Path::More which
    does similar to the above.

    A module can also be loaded from a require hook in ~@INC~ (like in the
    case of fatpacked or datapacked script) and the above methods does not
    handle it. Instead, you'll need to use Module::Load::Conditional's
    "check_install" or Module::Installed::Tiny's "module_installed":

     use Module::Load::Conditional qw(check_install);
     if (check_install(module => "Foo::Bar")) {
         # Foo::Bar is installed
     }

    The above does not guarantee that the module will be loaded
    successfully. To check that, there's no other way but to actually try to
    load it:

     if (eval { require Foo::Bar; 1 }) {
         # Foo::Bar can be loaded (and was loaded!)
     }
