NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable - List of modules to
    check if a module is installed or loadable

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable (from Perl
    distribution Acme-CPANModules-CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable), released
    on 2023-08-06.

DESCRIPTION
    If you simply want to check that a module's ".pm" file is locatable in
    @INC, you can just do something like:

     my $mod = "Foo/Bar.pm";
     for my $dir (@INC) {
         next if ref $dir;
         if (-f "$dir/$mod") {
             print "Module $mod is installed";
             last;
         }
     }

    Or you can use something like Module::Path or Module::Path::More which
    does similar to the above.

    A module can also be loaded from a require hook in ~@INC~ (like in the
    case of fatpacked or datapacked script) and the above methods does not
    handle it. Instead, you'll need to use Module::Load::Conditional's
    "check_install" or Module::Installed::Tiny's "module_installed":

     use Module::Load::Conditional qw(check_install);
     if (check_install(module => "Foo::Bar")) {
         # Foo::Bar is installed
     }

    The above does not guarantee that the module will be loaded
    successfully. To check that, there's no other way but to actually try to
    load it:

     if (eval { require Foo::Bar; 1 }) {
         # Foo::Bar can be loaded (and was loaded!)
     }

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::CheckingModuleInstalledLoadable::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
