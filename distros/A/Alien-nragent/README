NAME

    Alien::nragent - (Deprecated) Download and install the NewRelic agent

VERSION

    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS

     use FFI::Platypus;
     use Alien::nragent;
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new;
     $ffi->lib(Alien::nragent->dynamic_libs);
     ...

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: This Alien is deprecated. It is based on the NewRelic Agent SDK,
    which was only ever released as beta software. Please use
    Alien::libnewrelic and NewFangle instead.

    This Alien dist installs and makes available the NewRelic agent
    library.

    If the NewRelic agent library is already in your library path, then
    they will be used.

    If the NewRelic agent library is installed in /opt/newrelic, then that
    will be used.

    Otherwise the NewRelic agent library will be downloaded, and installed.

CAVEATS

 Platform Limitations

    The SDK binaries provided by New Relic only work on Linux x86_64. The
    binaries are labeled as a "beta". The most recent version available (as
    of this writing) is dated July 1, 2019. However, I believe the New
    Relic Agent SDK is no longer being actively developed, and you are
    encouraged to consider the New Relic C SDK instead.

    I have found that previous versions worked on Ubuntu Precise and
    Xenial, but not Cent OS 7. Your mileage my vary.

 Not Fork Safe!

    Bad things will happen if you call newrelic_init before forking. So
    don't do that.
