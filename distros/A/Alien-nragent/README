VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use FFI::Platypus;
     use Alien::nragent;
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new;
     $ffi->lib(Alien::nragent->dynamic_libs);

DESCRIPTION

    This Alien dist installs and makes available the NewRelic agent
    library.

    If the NewRelic agent library is already in your library path, then
    they will be used.

    If the NewRelic agent library is installed in /opt/newrelic, then that
    will be used.

    Otherwise the NewRelic agent library will be downloaded, and installed.

CAVEATS

 Platform Limitations

    The SDK binaries provided by New Relic only work on Linux x86_64. The
    binaries are labeled as a "beta" and were released in July 2016. It
    doesn't seem likely that New Relic will be releasing new versions of
    the SDK. The author of this module has had good success getting this
    module to work on Ubuntu Precise and Xenial, and heard from user
    feedback that it works with Bionic. I have heard that it does NOT work
    with CentOS 7. Your mileage may vary.

 Not Fork Safe!

    Bad things will happen if you call newrelic_init before forking. So
    don't do that.
