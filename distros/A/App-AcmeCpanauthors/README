VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::AcmeCpanauthors (from Perl

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script acme-cpanauthors.

FUNCTIONS
  acme_cpanauthors
    Usage:

     acme_cpanauthors(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Unofficial CLI for Acme::CPANAuthors.

    Examples:

    *   List installed Acme::CPANAuthors::* modules:

         acme_cpanauthors(action => "list_installed");

    *   List available Acme::CPANAuthors::* modules on CPAN:

         acme_cpanauthors(action => "list_cpan");

    *   Like previous example, but use local CPAN mirror first:

         acme_cpanauthors(action => "list_cpan", lcpan => 1);

    *   List PAUSE ID's of Indonesian authors:

         acme_cpanauthors(module => "Indonesian", action => "list_ids");

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   detail => *bool*

        Display more information when listing modules/result.

    *   lcpan => *bool*

        Use local CPAN mirror first when available (for -L).

    *   module => *str*

        Acme::CPANAuthors::* module name, without Acme::CPANAuthors::
        prefix.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  DEBUG => bool

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
