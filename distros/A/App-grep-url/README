VERSION

FUNCTIONS
  grep_url
    Usage:

     grep_url(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Print lines having URL(s) (optionally of certain criteria) in them.

    This is a grep-like utility that greps for URLs of certain criteria.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   color => *str* (default: "auto")

    *   count => *true*

        Supress normal output, return a count of matching lines.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

    *   host_contains => *str*

    *   host_matches => *re*

    *   host_not_contains => *str*

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        Invert the sense of matching.

    *   line_number => *true*

    *   max_urls => *int* (default: -1)

    *   min_urls => *uint* (default: 1)

    *   path_contains => *str*

    *   path_matches => *re*

    *   path_not_contains => *str*

    *   query_param_contains => *hash*

    *   query_param_matches => *hash*

    *   query_param_not_contains => *hash*

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   scheme_contains => *str*

    *   scheme_matches => *re*

    *   scheme_not_contains => *str*

    *   schemes => *array[str]* (default: ["http","file"])

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
