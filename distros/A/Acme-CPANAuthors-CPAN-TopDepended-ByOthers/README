SYNOPSIS

       use Acme::CPANAuthors;
       use Acme::CPANAuthors::TopDepended::ByOthers;
    
       my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new('CPAN::TopDepended::ByOthers');
    
       my $number   = $authors->count;
       my @ids      = $authors->id;
       my @distros  = $authors->distributions('RJBS');
       my $url      = $authors->avatar_url('RJBS');
       my $kwalitee = $authors->kwalitee('RJBS');

DESCRIPTION

    This module, like Acme::CPANAuthors::CPAN::TopDepended, lists 50 CPAN
    authors with the largest number of distributions directly depending to
    one of his/her modules. The difference is, only distributions by other
    authors are counted. This in some cases might be a better indication of
    how "depended upon" an author is, as some authors might have modules
    that are mostly depended by his/her own distributions.

    This list is produced by querying a local mini CPAN mirror using this
    command:

     % lcpan authors-by-rdep-count --exclude-same-author | head -n 50

    Statistics of the CPAN mirror:

    # COMMAND: lcpan stats-last-index-time --format text-pretty

    Current ranking:

    # CODE: require Perinci::Result::Format::Lite; print
    Perinci::Result::Format::Lite::format($main::res, 'text-pretty');
