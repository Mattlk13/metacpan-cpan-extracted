NAME

    Array::Queue::Priority - A custom sorted queue

VERSION

    version 0.1.2

SYNOPSIS

        my $queue = Array::Queue::Priority->new(
            sort_cb => sub {
                $_[0]->{last_name} cmp $_[1]->{last_name}
            });
        $ar->add({ last_name => 'Rogers' });
        $ar->add({ last_name => 'Stark' });
        $ar->add({ last_name => 'Banner' });
    
        while ($node = $queue->first) {
            # do things with node
            $queue->remove;
        }

DESCRIPTION

    Array::Queue::Priority priority queue, sorted by whatever you desire.

    As values are inserted, they are sorted on the fly, ensuring the values
    come out in the order you desire. You simply supply the sort_cb at the
    time of construction.

    If no sort_cb is supplied, it will try to sort by values passed. You'll
    probably get warnings if that's just a string, and who knows what you
    will get if it's a hashref. Straight numbers will work just find
    though.

    Call first() then remove() for a little "transactional safety" if
    there's an error processing the first item in the queue.

    Inherits from Array::Queue.
