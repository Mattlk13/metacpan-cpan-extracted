Algorithm::Evolutionary::Utils
===================================

This is the repo for development of
[`Algorithm::Evolutionary::Utils`](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Algorithm-Evolutionary-Utils/),
a CPAN module for creating evolutionary algorithms using Perl. 

It is mainly intended to be used as a base for other Perl modules that deal with evolutionary algorithms, this way it is all kept in a single place.
