NAME
    App::PasswordWordListUtils - Command-line utilities related to checking
    string against password wordlists

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::PasswordWordListUtils
    (from Perl distribution App-PasswordWordListUtils), released on
    2020-05-23.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   exists-in-password-wordlist

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  exists_in_password_wordlist
    Usage:

     exists_in_password_wordlist(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Check that string(s) match(es) word in a password wordlist.

    Password wordlist is one of WordList::* modules, without the prefix.

    Since many password wordlist uses bloom filter, that means there's a
    possibility of false positive (e.g. 0.1% chance; see each password
    wordlist for more details).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *bool*

    *   strings* => *array[str]*

    *   wordlist => *perl::wordlist::modname* (default:
        "Password::10Million::Top1000000")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
