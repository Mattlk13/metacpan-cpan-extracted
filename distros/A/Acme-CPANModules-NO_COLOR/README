NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::NO_COLOR - Modules that follow the NO_COLOR
    convention

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Acme::CPANModules::NO_COLOR
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-NO_COLOR), released on
    2018-12-22.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that follow the NO_COLOR convention.

    The NO_COLOR convention (see https://no-color.org) lets user disable
    color output of console programs by defining an environment variable
    called NO_COLOR. The existence of said environment variable, regardless
    of its value, signals that programs should not use colored output.

    If you know of other modules that should be listed here, please contact
    me.
