NAME

    Alien::autoconf - Build or find autoconf

VERSION

    version 0.17

SYNOPSIS

    From your script or module:

     use Alien::autoconf;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::autoconf->bin_dir;

    From your alienfile:

     use alienfile;
     
     share {
       # Alien::Autotools will pull in:
       #  - Alien::autoconf
       #  - Alien::automake
       #  - Alien::m4
       #  - Alien::libtool
       # all of which you will likely need.
       requires 'Alien::Autotools';
       plugin 'Build::Autoconf';
       build [
         'autoreconf -vfi',
         '%{configure}',
         '%{make}',
         '%{make} install',
       ];
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides autoconf so that it can be used by other
    Perl distributions that are on CPAN. This is most commonly necessary
    when creating other Aliens that target a autoconf project that does not
    ship with a configure script. Ideally you should complain to the
    upstream developers, but if you are not able to convince them then you
    have this option. There are currently two such Aliens: Alien::libuv and
    Alien::Hunspell.

METHODS

 bin_dir

     my @dirs = Alien::autoconf->bin_dir;

    Returns a list of directories that need to be added to the PATH in
    order to use autoconf.

CAVEATS

    This module is currently configured to always do a share install. This
    is because system installs for this alien are not reliable. Please see
    this issue for details:
    https://github.com/plicease/Alien-autoconf/issues/2. The good news is
    that most of the time you shouldn't need this module unless you are
    building another alien from source. If your system provides the package
    that is targeted by the upstream alien I recommend using that. If you
    are packaging system packages for your platform then I recommend making
    sure the upstream alien uses the system library so you won't need to
    install this module.
