NAME
    Alien::Ruby - Find or install Ruby

SYNOPSIS
     use Alien::Ruby;

     use Env qw( @PATH );
 
     unshift @PATH, Alien::Ruby->bin_dir;

     system(q(ruby -e 'puts "Hello from Ruby!"'));

     system('gem install pry');

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the Ruby programming language so that it can
    be used by other Perl distributions. It does this by first trying to
    detect an existing install of Ruby on your system. If found it will use
    that. If it cannot be found, the Ruby source code will be downloaded
    from the internet and it will be compiled and installed to a private
    share location for the use of other Perl modules.

GEM / BUNDLER
    Because RubyGems (since Ruby 1.9) and Bundler (since Ruby 2.6) are
    included with Ruby, and the "gem" and "bundle" executables are installed
    into the same directory as the "ruby" executable, you can use
    Alien::Ruby as if it were Alien::Gem or Alien::Bundler.

    Please be mindful of the $ENV{GEM_HOME} and $ENV{GEM_PATH} environment
    variables. These variables will change the default locations where Gem's
    can be found, and where Gem's will be installed.

SPECIFY RUBY VERSION
    To specify the version of Ruby you want, set the "ALIEN_RUBY_VERSION"
    environment variable before installing Alien::Ruby:

      $ ALIEN_RUBY_VERSION=2.7.7 cpanm Alien::Ruby

    The minimum supported Ruby version is 2.1.0.
