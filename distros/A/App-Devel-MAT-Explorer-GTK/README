    App::Devel::MAT::Explorer::GTK - GTK-based interactive explorer for
    Devel::MAT

INSTALLATION

 SVG Loading

    If running this program produces errors similar to

       Couldn't recognize the image file format for file '.../Devel-MAT-UI/icons/refs-All.svg'
       at .../App/Devel/MAT/Explorer/GTK/Resources.pm line 61.

    this is likely because gdk-pixbuf does not have an image loader for the
    SVG format. This is probably fixed by installing librsvg2, for example

       $ apt-get install librsvg2-2
       $ pkg install librsvg2
       etc...
