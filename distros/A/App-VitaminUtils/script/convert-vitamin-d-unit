=head1 NAME

convert-vitamin-d-unit - Convert a vitamin D quantity from one unit to another

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.004 of convert-vitamin-d-unit (from Perl distribution App-VitaminUtils), released on 2021-08-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

% B<convert-vitamin-d-unit> [B<--format>=I<name>] [B<--json>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]] [B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] -- E<lt>I<quantity>E<gt> [I<to_unit>]

Examples:

Show all possible conversions:

 % convert-vitamin-d-unit mcg
 +--------+------+
 | amount | unit |
 +--------+------+
 | 1      | mcg  |
 | 0.001  | mg   |
 | 40     | IU   |
 +--------+------+

Convert from mcg to IU:

 % convert-vitamin-d-unit '2 mcg' IU
 80

Convert from IU to mg:

 % convert-vitamin-d-unit '5000 IU' mg
 0.125

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If target unit is not specified, will show all known conversions.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--quantity>=I<s>*

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--to-unit>=I<s>

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C convert-vitamin-d-unit convert-vitamin-d-unit

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete convert-vitamin-d-unit 'p/*/`convert-vitamin-d-unit`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
