NAME

    Alt::Tickit::Widgets::ObjectPad - an alternative implemention of
    Tickit::Widgets based on Object::Pad

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides an alternative implementation of
    Tickit::Widgets whose classes are built using Object::Pad, rather than
    basic perl OO. Its functionallity is intended to be identical to the
    primary distribution. It exists simply to demonstrate the use of
    Object::Pad in nontrivial code examples, and to help smoke test the
    module being used.

INSTALLATION

    For safety purposes, by default this module installs into a local
    directory rather than overwriting the primary installation path. If you
    wish to install this implementation directly over the primary one, set
    the environment variable PERL_ALT_INSTALL to the value OVERWRITE.

       $ PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpan Alt::Tickit::Widgets::ObjectPad

    or

       $ PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE perl Build.PL
       $ ./Build && ./Build install

    or other equivalent.
