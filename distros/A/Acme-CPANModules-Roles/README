NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Roles - List of libraries for doing roles with Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Acme::CPANModules::Roles (from
    Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Roles), released on 2023-10-31.

DESCRIPTION
    Roles are a way to write classes by composing them from simpler
    components, instead of using inheritance from parent classes.

    The Perl core does not provide a role mechanism for you, but there are
    several role frameworks you can choose in Perl. This list orders them
    from the most lightweight.

    Role::Tiny. Basic role support plus method modifiers ("before", "after",
    "around").

    Moo::Role. Based on Role::Tiny, it adds attribute support. Suitable if
    you use Moo as your object system.

    Role::Basic. Despite having less features than Role::Tiny (no method
    modifiers), Role::Basic starts a bit slower because it loads some more
    modules.

    Mouse::Role. Suitable only if you are already using Mouse as your object
    system.

    Moose::Role. Offers the most features (particularly the meta protocol),
    but also the heaviest. Suitable only if you are already using Moose as
    your object system.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Roles

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Roles | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=Roles -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Roles -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Roles::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
