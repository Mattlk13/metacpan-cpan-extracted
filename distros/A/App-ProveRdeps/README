NAME
    App::ProveRdeps - Prove all distributions depending on specified
    module(s)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of App::ProveRdeps (from Perl
    distribution App-ProveRdeps), released on 2020-03-07.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script prove-rdeps.

FUNCTIONS
  prove_rdeps
    Usage:

     prove_rdeps(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Prove all distributions depending on specified module(s).

    To use this utility, first create "~/.config/prove-rdeps.conf":

     dists_dirs = ~/repos
     dists_dirs = ~/repos-other

    The above tells *prove-rdeps* where to look for Perl distributions.
    Then:

     % prove-rdeps Regexp::Pattern

    This will search local CPAN mirror for all distributions that depend on
    Log::ger (by default for phase=runtime and rel=requires), then search
    the distributions in the distribution directories (or download them from
    local CPAN mirror), "cd" to each and run "prove" in it.

    You can run with "--dry-run" ("-n") option first to not actually run
    "prove" but just see what distributions will get tested. An example
    output:

     % prove-rdeps Regexp::Pattern -n
     prove-rdeps: Found dep: Acme-DependOnEverything (runtime requires)
     prove-rdeps: Found dep: App-BlockWebFlooders (runtime requires)
     prove-rdeps: Found dep: App-Licensecheck (runtime requires)
     prove-rdeps: Found dep: Pod-Weaver-Plugin-Regexp-Pattern (develop x_spec)
     prove-rdeps: Dep Pod-Weaver-Plugin-Regexp-Pattern skipped (phase not included)
     ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [1/8] Running prove for dist 'Acme-DependOnEverything' in '/tmp/BP3l0kiuZH/Acme-DependOnEverything-0.06' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [2/8] Running prove for dist 'App-BlockWebFlooders' in '/home/u1/repos/perl-App-BlockWebFlooders' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [3/8] Running prove for dist 'App-Licensecheck' in '/tmp/pw1hBzUIaZ/App-Licensecheck-v3.0.40' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [4/8] Running prove for dist 'App-RegexpPatternUtils' in '/home/u1/repos/perl-App-RegexpPatternUtils' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [5/8] Running prove for dist 'Bencher-Scenarios-RegexpPattern' in '/home/u1/repos/perl-Bencher-Scenarios-RegexpPattern' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [6/8] Running prove for dist 'Regexp-Common-RegexpPattern' in '/home/u1/repos/perl-Regexp-Common-RegexpPattern' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [7/8] Running prove for dist 'Release-Util-Git' in '/home/u1/repos/perl-Release-Util-Git' ...
     prove-rdeps: [DRY] [8/8] Running prove for dist 'Test-Regexp-Pattern' in '/home/u1/repos/perl-Test-Regexp-Pattern' ...

    The above example shows that I have the distribution directories locally
    on my "~/repos", except for "Acme-DependOnEverything" and
    "App-Licensecheck", which *prove-rdeps* downloads and extracts from
    local CPAN mirror and puts into temporary directories.

    If we reinvoke the above command without the "-n", *prove-rdeps* will
    actually run "prove" on each directory and provide a summary at the end.
    Example output:

     % prove-rdeps Regexp::Pattern
     ...
     +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | dist                        | reason                            | status |
     +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | Acme-DependOnEverything     | Test failed (Failed 1/1 subtests) | 500    |
     | App-Licensecheck            | Test failed (No subtests run)     | 500    |
     | Regexp-Common-RegexpPattern | Non-zero exit code (2)            | 500    |
     +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

    The above example shows that three distributions failed testing. You can
    scroll up for the detailed "prove" output to see why they failed, fix
    things, and re-run. To skip some dists from being tested, use
    "--exclude-dist":

     % prove-rdeps Regexp::Pattern --exclude-dist Acme-DependOnEverything

    Or you can also put these lines in the configuration file:

     exclude_dists = Acme-DependOnEverything
     exclude_dists = Regexp-Common-RegexpPattern

    How distribution directory is searched: see App::ProveDists
    documentation.

    When a dependent distribution cannot be found or downloaded/extracted,
    this counts as a 412 error (Precondition Failed).

    When a distribution's test fails, this counts as a 500 error (Error).
    Otherwise, the status is 200 (OK).

    *prove-rdeps* will return status 200 (OK) with the status of each dist.
    It will exit 0 if all distros are successful, otherwise it will exit 1.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dists_dirs* => *array[dirname]*

        Where to find the distributions directories.

    *   download => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to try download/extract distribution from local CPAN mirror
        (when not found in dists_dirs).

    *   exclude_dist_pattern => *re*

        Distribution name pattern to skip.

    *   exclude_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

        Distributions to skip.

    *   include_dist_pattern => *re*

        If specified, only include distributions with this pattern.

    *   include_dists => *array[perl::distname]*

        If specified, only include these distributions.

    *   modules* => *array[perl::modname]*

        Module names to find dependents of.

    *   phases => *array[str]* (default: ["runtime"])

        Only select dists that depend in these phases.

    *   prove_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-l"])

        Options to pass to the prove command.

    *   rels => *array[str]* (default: ["requires"])

        Only select dists that depend using these relationships.

    *   summarize_all => *bool*

        If true, also summarize successes in addition to failures.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
