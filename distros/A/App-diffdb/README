FUNCTIONS
  diffdb
    Usage:

     diffdb(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Compare two databases, line by line.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action => *str* (default: "diff_db")

    *   dbh1 => *obj*

        Alternative to specifying dsn1/user1/password1.

    *   dbh2 => *obj*

        Alternative to specifying dsn2/user2/password2.

    *   diff_command => *str* (default: "diff")

    *   dsn1 => *str*

        DBI data source, e.g. "dbi:SQLite:dbname=/path/to/db1.db".

    *   dsn2 => *str*

        DBI data source, e.g. "dbi:SQLite:dbname=/path/to/db1.db".

    *   password1 => *str*

        You might want to specify this parameter in a configuration file
        instead of directly as command-line option.

    *   password2 => *str*

        Will default to "password1" if "password1" is specified.

        You might want to specify this parameter in a configuration file
        instead of directly as command-line option.

    *   row_as => *str* (default: "json-card")

    *   user1 => *str*

    *   user2 => *str*

        Will default to "user1" if "user1" is specified.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
