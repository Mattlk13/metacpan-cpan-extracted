NAME
    App::GoogleAuthUtils - Utilities related to Google Authenticator

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of App::GoogleAuthUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-GoogleAuthUtils), released on 2024-04-18.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   gen-google-auth-qrcode

FUNCTIONS
  gen_google_auth_qrcode
    Usage:

     gen_google_auth_qrcode(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate Google authenticator QR code (barcode) from a secret key.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         gen_google_auth_qrcode(
           secret_key => "6XDT6TSOGR5SCWKHXZ4DFBRXJVZGAKAW",
           issuer => "example.com"
         );

    When generating a new 2FA token, you are usually presented with a secret
    key as well as a 2D barcode (QR code) representation of this secret key.
    You are advised to store the secret key and it's usually more convenient
    to store the key code instead of the QR code. But when entering the
    secret key to the Google authenticator app, it's often more convenient
    to scan the barcode instead of typing or copy-pasting the code.

    This utility will convert the secret key code into bar code (opened in a
    browser) so you can conveniently scan the bar code into your app.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   account => *str*

        (No description)

    *   issuer* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   output => *filename*

        (No description)

    *   secret_key* => *str*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
