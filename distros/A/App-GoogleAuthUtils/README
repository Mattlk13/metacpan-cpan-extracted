NAME
    App::GoogleAuthUtils - Utilities related to Google Authenticator

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::GoogleAuthUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-GoogleAuthUtils), released on 2018-02-08.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   gen-google-auth-qrcode

FUNCTIONS
  gen_google_auth_qrcode
    Usage:

     gen_google_auth_qrcode(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Generate Google authenticator QR code (barcode) from a secret key.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         gen_google_auth_qrcode(
         secret_key => "6XDT6TSOGR5SCWKHXZ4DFBRXJVZGAKAW",
           issuer => "example.com"
         );

        Result:

         undef

    When generating a new 2FA token, you are usually presented with a secret
    key as well as a 2D barcode (QR code) representation of this secret key.
    You are advised to store the secret key and it's usually more convenient
    to store the key code instead of the QR code. But when entering the
    secret key to the Google authenticator app, it's often more convenient
    to scan the barcode instead of typing or copy-pasting the code.

    This utility will convert the secret key code into bar code (opened in a
    browser) so you can conveniently scan the bar code into your app.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   account => *str*

    *   issuer* => *str*

    *   secret_key* => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
