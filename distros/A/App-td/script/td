=head1 NAME

td - Manipulate table data

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.103 of td (from Perl distribution App-td), released on 2021-05-29.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % td [--detail] [-e=s+] [--exclude-column=s+] [--exclude-columns-json=s]
     [--format=name] [--json] [-l] [--lines=s] [-n=s] [--(no)naked-res]
     [--no-detail] [--no-header-column] [--no-repeat] [--nodetail]
     [--norepeat] [--page-result[=program]] [-r] [--repeat]
     [--view-result[=program]] <action> [argv] ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<td> receives table data from standard input and performs an action on it. It
has functionality similar to some Unix commands like I<head>, I<tail>, I<wc>,
I<cut>, I<sort> except that it operates on table rows/columns instead of
lines/characters. This is convenient to use with CLI scripts that output table
data.

A I<table data> is JSON-encoded data in the form of either: C<hos> (hash of
scalars, which is viewed as a two-column table where the columns are C<key> and
C<value>), C<aos> (array of scalars, which is viewed as a 1-column array where the
column is C<elem>), C<aoaos> (array of arrays of scalars), or C<aohos> (array of
hashes of scalars).

The input can also be an I<enveloped> table data, where the envelope is an array:
C<[status, message, content, meta]> and C<content> is the actual table data. This
kind of data is produced by C<Perinci::CmdLine>-based scripts and can contain
more detailed table specification in the C<meta> hash, which C<td> can parse.

First you might want to use the C<info> action to see if the input is a table
data:

 % osnames -l --json | td info

If input is not valid JSON, a JSON parse error will be displayed. If input is
valid JSON but not a table data, another error will be displayed. Otherwise,
information about the table will be displayed (form, number of columns, column
names, number of rows, and so on).

Next, you can use these actions:

 # List available actions
 % td actions
 
 # Convert table data (which might be hash, aos, or aohos) to aoaos form
 % list-files -l --json | td as-aoaos
 
 # Convert table data (which might be hash, aos, or aoaos) to aohos form
 % list-files -l --json | td as-aohos
 
 # Display table data on the browser using datatables (to allow interactive sorting and filtering)
 % osnames -l | td cat --format html+datatables
 
 # Convert table data to CSV
 % list-files -l --json | td as-csv
 
 # Calculate arithmetic average of numeric columns
 % list-files -l --json | td avg
 
 # Append a row at the end containing arithmetic average of number columns
 % list-files -l --json | td avg-row
 
 # Count number of columns
 % osnames -l --json | td colcount
 
 # Append a single-column row at the end containing number of columns
 % osnames -l --json | td colcount-row
 
 # Return the column names only
 % lcpan related-mods Perinci::CmdLine | td colnames
 
 # append a row containing column names
 % lcpan related-mods Perinci::CmdLine | td colnames-row
 
 # Only show first 5 rows
 % osnames -l --json | td head -n5
 
 # Show all but the last 5 rows
 % osnames -l --json | td head -n -5
 
 # Check if input is table data and show information about the table
 % osnames -l --json | td info
 
 # Count number of rows
 % osnames -l --json | td rowcount
 % osnames -l --json | td wc            ;# shorter alias
 
 # Append a single-column row containing row count
 % osnames -l --json | td rowcount-row
 % osnames -l --json | td wc-row        ;# shorter alias
 
 # Add a row number column (1, 2, 3, ...)
 % list-files -l --json | td rownum-col
 
 # Select some columns
 % osnames -l --json | td select value description
 
 # Select all columns but some
 % osnames -l --json | td select '*' -e value -e description
 
 # Return the rows in a random order
 % osnames -l --json | td shuf
 
 # Pick 5 random rows from input
 % osnames -l --json | td shuf -n5
 
 # Sort by column(s) (add "-" prefix to for descending order)
 % osnames -l --json | td sort value tags
 % osnames -l --json | td sort -- -value
 
 # Return sum of all numeric columns
 % list-files -l --json | td sum
 
 # Append a sum row
 % list-files -l --json | td sum-row
 
 # Only show last 5 rows
 % osnames -l --json | td tail -n5
 
 # Show rows from the row 5 onwards
 % osnames -l --json | td tail -n +5
 
 # Transpose table (make first column of rows as column names in the
 # transposed table)
 
 % osnames -l --json | td transpose
 
 # Transpose table (make columns named 'row1', 'row2', 'row3', ... in the
 # transposed table)
 
 % osnames -l --json | td transpose --no-header-column
 
 # Use Perl code to filter rows. Perl code gets row in $row or $_
 # (scalar/aos/hos) or $rowhash (always a hos) or $rowarray (always aos).
 # There are also $rownum (integer, starts at 0) and $td (table data object).
 # Perl code is eval'ed in the 'main' package with strict/warnings turned
 # off. The example below selects videos that are larger than 480p.
 
 % media-info *.mp4 | td grep 'use List::Util qw(min); min($_->{video_height}, $_->{video_width}) > 480'
 
 # Use Perl code to filter columns. Perl code gets column name in $colname or
 # $_. There's also $colidx (column index, from 1) and $td (table data
 # object). If table data form is 'hash' or 'aos', it will be transformed
 # into 'aoaos'. The example below only select even columns that match
 # /col/i. Note that most of the time, 'td select' is better. But when you
 # have a lot of columns and want to select them programmatically, you have
 # grep-col.
 
 % somecd --json | td grep-col '$colidx % 2 == 0 && /col/i'
 
 # Use Perl code to transform row. Perl code gets row in $row or $_
 # (scalar/hash/array) and is supposed to return the new row. As in 'grep',
 # $rowhash, $rowarray, $rownum, $td are also available as helper. The
 # example below adds a field called 'is_landscape'.
 
 % media-info *.jpg | td map '$_->{is_landscape} = $_->{video_height} < $_->{video_width} ? 1:0; $_'
 
 # Use perl code to sort rows. Perl sorter code gets row in $a & $b or $_[0]
 # & $_[1] (hash/array). Sorter code, like in Perl's standard sort(), is
 # expected to return -1/0/1. The example belows sort videos by height,
 # descendingly then by width, descendingly.
 
 % media-info *.mp4 | td psort '$b->{video_height} <=> $a->{video_height} || $b->{video_width} <=> $b->{video_width}'

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--action>=I<s>*

Action to perform on input table.

Valid values:

 ["actions","as-aoaos","as-aohos","as-csv","avg","avg-row","cat","colcount","colcount-row","colnames","colnames-row","grep","grep-col","grep-row","head","info","map","map-row","psort","rowcount","rowcount-row","rownum-col","select","shuf","sort","sum","sum-row","tail","transpose","wc","wc-row"]

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--argv-json>=I<s>

Arguments (JSON-encoded).

See C<--argv>.

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument and onwards.

=item B<--argv>=I<s@>

Arguments.

Default value:

 []

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head2 Actions action options

=over

=item B<--detail>, B<-l>

=back

=head2 Head action options

=over

=item B<--lines>=I<s>, B<-n>

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Select action options

=over

=item B<--exclude-column>=I<s@>, B<-e>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--exclude-columns-json>=I<s>

See C<--exclude-column>.

=back

=head2 Shuf action options

=over

=item B<--repeat>, B<-r>

Allow duplicates.

=back

=head2 Tail action options

=over

=item B<--lines>=I<s>, B<-n>

=back

=head2 Transpose action options

=over

=item B<--no-header-column>

Don't make the first column as column names of the transposed table; instead create column named 'row1', 'row2', ....

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C td td

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete td 'p/*/`td`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
