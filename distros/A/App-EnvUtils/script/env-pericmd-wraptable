=head1 NAME

env-pericmd-wraptable - Run command with FORMAT_PRETTY_TABLE_BACKEND set to Text::ANSITable

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of env-pericmd-wraptable (from Perl distribution App-EnvUtils), released on 2024-11-12.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % env-pericmd-wraptable foo --pager

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This wrapper is useful for running L<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite>-based scripts that
output text table with long text. By default the table renderer
(L<Text::Table::Sprintf>) does not wrap long text in table cells, making long
text harder to read. This wrapper sets C<FORMAT_PRETTY_TABLE_BACKEND> to
C<Text::ANSITable>, which does wrap long text by default.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-EnvUtils>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
