NAME
    Array::Sample::Partition - Sample elements from an array by equal
    partitions

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Array::Sample::Partition (from
    Perl distribution Array-Sample-Partition), released on 2022-05-20.

SYNOPSIS
     use Array::Sample::Partition qw(sample_partition);

     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4], 1); => (2)
     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4], 2); => (1,3)
     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4], 3); => (1,2,3)

     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4,5], 1); => (3)
     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4,5], 2); => (2,4)
     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4,5], 3); => (1,3,4)
     sample_partition([0,1,2,3,4,5], 4); => (1,2,3,4)

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    All functions are not exported by default, but exportable.

  sample_partition
    Syntax: sample_partition(\@ary, $n [ , \%opts ]) => list

    Options:

    *   pos => bool

        If set to true, will return positions instead of the elements.

    The function takes an array reference ("\@ary") and number of samples to
    take ($n). It will first divide the array into $n+1 of (whenever
    possible) equal-sized partitions, leaving an element between partitions,
    then get the elements between the partitions.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
