    *   Find out how many milligrams of elemental magnesium is in 1000mg of
        pure magnesium l-threonate (but note that a supplement product might
        not contain 100%-pure compound):

         convert_magnesium_unit(quantity => "1000 mg-mg-l-threonate", to_unit => "mg-mg-elem");

        Result:

         [200, "OK", 83, {}]

    *   Find out how many milligrams of elemental magnesium is in 3g (1
        recommended serving) of NOW Foods magnesium citrate powder
        (magnesium content is as advertised on the label):

         convert_magnesium_unit(
           quantity => "3000 mg-mg-citrate-ah-nowfoods",
           to_unit  => "mg-mg-elem"
         );

        Result:

         [200, "OK", 435, {}]

    *   Find out how many milligrams of elemental magnesium is in 2.5g (1
        recommended serving) of NOW Foods magnesium bisglycinate powder
        (magnesium content is as advertised on the label):

         convert_magnesium_unit(
           quantity => "2500 mg-mg-bisglycinate-nowfoods",
           to_unit  => "mg-mg-elem"
         );

        Result:

         [200, "OK", 250, {}]

    If target unit is not specified, will show all known conversions.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quantity => *str* (default: "1 mg")

    *   to_unit => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
