NAME
    App::MineralUtils - Utilities related to minerals (and mineral
    supplements)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::MineralUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-MineralUtils), released on 2021-08-12.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   convert-magnesium-unit

FUNCTIONS
  convert_magnesium_unit
    Usage:

     convert_magnesium_unit(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Convert a magnesium quantity from one unit to another.

    Examples:

    *   Show all possible conversions:

         convert_magnesium_unit(quantity => "mg");

        Result:

         [
           200,
           "OK",
           [
             { amount => 1, unit => "mg" },
             { amount => 1, unit => "mg-magnesium-elemental" },
             { amount => 8.90471950133571, unit => "mg-magnesium-citrate" },
             { amount => 7.09219858156028, unit => "mg-magnesium-glycinate" },
             { amount => 7.09219858156028, unit => "mg-magnesium-bisglycinate" },
             { amount => 13.8888888888889, unit => "mg-magnesium-l-threonate" },
             { amount => 1.65837479270315, unit => "mg-magnesium-oxide" },
           ],
           {},
         ]

    *   Find out how many mg of elemental magnesium is in 1000mg of
        magnesium l-threonate:

         convert_magnesium_unit(
           quantity => "1000 mg-magnesium-l-threonate",
           to_unit  => "mg-magnesium-elemental"
         );

        Result:

         [200, "OK", 72, {}]

    If target unit is not specified, will show all known conversions.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quantity* => *str*

    *   to_unit => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
