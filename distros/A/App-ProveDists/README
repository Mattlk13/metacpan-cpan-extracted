NAME
    App::ProveDists - Prove Perl distributions

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::ProveDists (from Perl
    distribution App-ProveDists), released on 2020-03-07.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script prove-dists.

FUNCTIONS
  prove_dists
    Usage:

     prove_dists(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Prove Perl distributions.

    To use this utility, first create "~/.config/prove-dists.conf":

     dists_dirs = ~/repos
     dists_dirs = ~/repos-other

    The above tells *prove-dists* where to look for Perl distributions.
    Then:

     % prove-dists '^Games-Word-Wordlist-.+$'

    This will search local CPAN mirror for all distributions that match that
    regex pattern, then search the distributions in the distribution
    directories (or download them from local CPAN mirror), "cd" to each and
    run "prove" in it.

    You can run with "--dry-run" ("-n") option first to not actually run
    "prove" but just see what distributions will get tested. An example
    output:

     % prove-dists '^Games-Word-Wordlist-.+$' -n
     prove-dists: Found dist: Games-Word-Wordlist-Country
     prove-dists: Found dist: Games-Word-Wordlist-Enable
     prove-dists: Found dist: Games-Word-Wordlist-HSK
     prove-dists: Found dist: Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI
     prove-dists: Found dist: Games-Word-Wordlist-SGB
     prove-dists: [DRY] [1/5] Running prove for distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-Country (directory /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-Country) ...
     prove-dists: [DRY] [2/5] Running prove for distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-Enable (directory /tmp/AmYe5AHXpm/Games-Word-Wordlist-Enable-2010090401) ...
     prove-dists: [DRY] [3/5] Running prove for distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-HSK (directory /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-HSK) ...
     prove-dists: [DRY] [4/5] Running prove for distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI (directory /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI) ...
     prove-dists: [DRY] [5/5] Running prove for distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-SGB (directory /tmp/xHAvt5uAhM/Games-Word-Wordlist-SGB-2010091501) ...

    The above example shows that I have the distribution directories locally
    on my "~/repos", except for "Games-Word-Wordlist-Enable" and
    "Games-Word-Wordlist-SGB", which *prove-dists* downloads and extracts
    from local CPAN mirror and puts into temporary directories.

    If we reinvoke the above command without the "-n", *prove-dists* will
    actually run "prove" on each directory and provide a summary at the end.
    Example output:

     % prove-dists '^Games-Word-Wordlist-.+$'
     +----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | dir                                          | label                                 | reason                            | status |
     +----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI | distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI | Test failed (Failed 1/1 subtests) | 500    |
     +----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

    The above example shows that one distribution failed testing. You can
    scroll up for the detailed "prove" output to see the detail of the
    failure, fix things, and re-run.

    To summarize not only failures but all successes as well, use
    "--summarize-all" option:

     % prove-dists '^Games-Word-Wordlist-.+$' --summarize-all
     +-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | dir                                                   | label                                    | reason                            | status |
     +-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+
     | /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-Country       | distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-Country | PASS                              | 200    |
     | /tmp/rjjMJVgaXg/Games-Word-Wordlist-Enable-2010090401 | distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-Enable  | PASS                              | 200    |
     | /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-HSK           | distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-HSK     | NOTESTS                           | 200    |
     | /home/u1/repos/perl-Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI          | distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-KBBI    | Test failed (Failed 1/1 subtests) | 500    |
     | /tmp/_W8im6EvA0/Games-Word-Wordlist-SGB-2010091501    | distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-SGB     | PASS                              | 200    |
     +-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

    How distribution directory is searched: first, the exact name
    ("My-Perl-Dist") is searched. If not found, then the name with different
    case (e.g. "my-perl-dist") is searched. If not found, a suffix match
    (e.g. "p5-My-Perl-Dist" or "cpan-My-Perl-Dist") is searched. If not
    found, a prefix match (e.g. "My-Perl-Dist-perl") is searched. If not
    found, *prove-dists* will try to download the distribution tarball from
    local CPAN mirror and extract it to a temporary directory. If
    "--no-dowload" is given, the *prove-dists* will not download from local
    CPAN mirror and give up for that distribution.

    When a distribution cannot be found or downloaded/extracted, this counts
    as a 412 error (Precondition Failed).

    When a distribution's test fails, this counts as a 500 error (Error).
    Otherwise, the status is 200 (OK).

    *prove-dists* will return status 200 (OK) with the status of each dist.
    It will exit 0 if all distros are successful, otherwise it will exit 1.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dist_patterns* => *array[re]*

        Distribution name patterns to find.

    *   dists_dirs* => *array[dirname]*

        Where to find the distributions directories.

    *   download => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to try download/extract distribution from local CPAN mirror
        (when not found in dists_dirs).

    *   prove_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-l"])

        Options to pass to the prove command.

    *   summarize_all => *bool*

        If true, also summarize successes in addition to failures.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
