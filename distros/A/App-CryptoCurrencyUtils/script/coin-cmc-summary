=head1 NAME

coin-cmc-summary - Get coin's CMC (coinmarketcap.com) summary

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.010 of coin-cmc-summary (from Perl distribution App-CryptoCurrencyUtils), released on 2018-02-05.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % coin-cmc-summary [options] [coin] ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Currently retrieves https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/<coin-id>/ and
return the data in a table.

If no coins are specified, will return global data.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--coin>=I<s@>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--coins-json>=I<s>

See C<--coin>.

=item B<--convert>=I<s>

Valid values:

 ["AUD","BRL","CAD","CHF","CLP","CNY","CZK","DKK","EUR","GBP","HKD","HUF","IDR","ILS","INR","JPY","KRW","MXN","MYR","NOK","NZD","PHP","PKR","PLN","RUB","SEK","SGD","THB","TRY","TWD","ZAR"]

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C coin-cmc-summary coin-cmc-summary

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh
