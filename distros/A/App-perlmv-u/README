    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code
    (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
    ($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is
    200. Third element ($payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
    element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
    that contains extra information.

    Return value: (any)

    invocation). This function supports transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file_pairs* => *array[array]*

        Pairs of [source, target].

        Both "source" and "target" must be absolute paths.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code
    (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
    ($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is

    Rename files using Perl code, with undo/redo.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    *   d => *bool*

        Alias for --dry-run.

    *   eval* => *str*

        Perl code to rename file.

        Your Perl code will receive the original filename in $_ and is

        filename, the file is not renamed.

    *   files* => *array[pathname]*

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.
