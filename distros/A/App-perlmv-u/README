    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

    invocation). This function supports transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file_pairs* => *array[array]*

        Pairs of [source, target].

        Both "source" and "target" must be absolute paths.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

  perlmv
    Usage:

    Rename files using Perl code, with undo/redo.

    *   d => *bool*

        Alias for --dry-run.

    *   eval* => *str*

        Perl code to rename file.

        Your Perl code will receive the original filename in $_ and is
        expected to modify it. If it is unmodified, the last expression is
        used as the new filename. If it is also the same as the original
        filename, the file is not renamed.

    *   files* => *array[pathname]*

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.
