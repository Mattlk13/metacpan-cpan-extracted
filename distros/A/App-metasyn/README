    This script is an alternative front-end to Acme::MetaSyntactic. Compared
    to the official CLI meta, this CLI is more oriented towards listing
    names instead of giving you one or several random names.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action => *str* (default: "list-names")

    *   categories => *bool*

    *   shuffle => *bool*

    *   theme => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
