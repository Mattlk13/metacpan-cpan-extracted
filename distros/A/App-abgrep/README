NAME
    App::abgrep - Print lines matching a pattern

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of App::abgrep (from Perl
    distribution App-abgrep), released on 2020-11-08.

FUNCTIONS
  abgrep
    Usage:

     abgrep(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Print lines matching a pattern.

    This is a grep-like utility that is based on AppBase::Grep, mainly for
    demoing and testing the module. The unique features include multiple
    patterns and "--dash-prefix-inverts".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all => *true*

        Require all patterns to match, instead of just one.

    *   color => *str*

    *   count => *true*

        Supress normal output, return a count of matching lines.

    *   dash_prefix_inverts => *bool*

        When given pattern that starts with dash "-FOO", make it to mean
        "^(?!.*FOO)".

        This is a convenient way to search for lines that do not match a
        pattern. Instead of using "-v" to invert the meaning of all
        patterns, this option allows you to invert individual pattern using
        the dash prefix, which is also used by Google search and a few other
        search engines.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        Invert the sense of matching.

    *   line_number => *true*

    *   pattern => *str*

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   regexps => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
