VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of App::TrimHistories (from Perl
    distribution App-TrimHistories), released on 2019-11-29.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script trim-histories.

FUNCTIONS
  trim_histories
    Usage:

     trim_histories(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Keep only a certain number of sets of file histories, delete the rest.

    This script can be used to delete old backup or log files. The files
    must be named with timestamps, e.g. "mydb-2017-06-14.sql.gz". By
    default, it keeps only 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 6 monthly histories. The
    rest will be deleted.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   discard_old_histories => *bool*

    *   discard_young_histories => *bool*

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

        Each file name must be unique and contain date, e.g.
        `backup-2017-06-14.tar.gz`.

    *   sets => *array[str]* (default: ["daily",7,"weekly",4,"monthly",6])

        History sets to keep.

        Expressed as a list of (period, num-to-keep) pairs. Period can be
        number of seconds or either "hourly", "daily", "weekly", "monthly",
        "yearly". The default is:

         ['daily', 7, 'weekly', 4, 'monthly', 6]

        which means to keep 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 6 monthly histories. It
        is equivalent to:

         [86400, 7, 7*86400, 4, 30*86400, 6]

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
