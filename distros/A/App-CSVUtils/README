FUNCTIONS
  csv_add_field
    Usage:

     csv_add_field(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Add a field to CSV file.

    Your Perl code (-e) will be called for each row (excluding the header
    row) and should return the value for the new field. $main::row is
    available and contains the current row, while $main::rownum contains the
    row number (2 means the first data row). $main::field_idxs is also
    available for additional information.

    Field by default will be added as the last field, unless you specify one
    of "--after" (to put after a certain field), "--before" (to put before a
    certain field), or "--at" (to put at specific position, 1 means as the
    first field).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   after => *str*

        Put the new field after specified field.

    *   at => *int*

        Put the new field at specific position (1 means as first field).

    *   before => *str*

        Put the new field before specified field.

    *   eval* => *str*

        Perl code to do munging.

    *   field* => *str*

        Field name.

    *   filename* => *filename*

        Input CSV file.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether CSV has a header row.

        When you declare that CSV does not have header row ("--no-header"),
        the fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

    *   tsv => *bool*

        Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of
        CSV.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third

    information.

    Return value: (any)

    Return value: (any)

  csv_map
    Usage:

     csv_map(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Return result of Perl code for every row.

    Examples:

    *   Create SQL insert statements (escaping is left as an exercise for
        users):

           filename => "file.csv",
           eval => "\"INSERT INTO mytable (id,amount) VALUES (\$_->{id}, \$_->{amount});\"",
           hash => 1
         );

    This is like Perl's "map" performed over rows of CSV. In $_, your Perl
    code will find the CSV row as an arrayref (or, if you specify "-H", as a
