=head1 NAME

csv-sort - Sort CSV rows

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.027 of csv-sort (from Perl distribution App-CSVUtils), released on 2019-12-23.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % csv-sort [options] <filename>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility sorts the rows in the CSV. Example input CSV:

 name,age
 Andy,20
 Dennis,15
 Ben,30
 Jerry,30

Example output CSV (using C<--by-fields +age> which means by age numerically and
ascending):

 name,age
 Dennis,15
 Andy,20
 Ben,30
 Jerry,30

Example output CSV (using C<--by-fields -age>, which means by age numerically and
descending):

 name,age
 Ben,30
 Jerry,30
 Andy,20
 Dennis,15

Example output CSV (using C<--by-fields name>, which means by name ascibetically
and ascending):

 name,age
 Andy,20
 Ben,30
 Dennis,15
 Jerry,30

Example output CSV (using C<--by-fields ~name>, which means by name ascibetically
and descending):

 name,age
 Jerry,30
 Dennis,15
 Ben,30
 Andy,20

Example output CSV (using C<--by-fields +age,~name>):

 name,age
 Dennis,15
 Andy,20
 Jerry,30
 Ben,30

You can also reverse the sort order (C<-r>), sort case-insensitively (C<-i>), or
provides the code (C<--by-code>, for example C<< --by-code '$a-E<gt>[1] E<lt>=E<gt> $b-E<gt>[1] ||
$b-E<gt>[0] cmp $a-E<gt>[0]' >> which is equivalent to C<--by-fields +age,~name>). If you
use C<--hash>, your code will receive the rows to be compared as hashref, e.g.
`--hash --by-code '$a->{age} <=> $b->{age} || $b->{name} cmp $a->{name}'.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--by-code-json>=I<s>

Perl code to do sorting (JSON-encoded).

See C<--by-code>.

=item B<--by-code>=I<s>

Perl code to do sorting.

`$a` and `$b` (or the first and second argument) will contain the two rows to be
compared.


=item B<--by-fields>=I<s>

A comma-separated list of field sort specification.

`+FIELD` to mean sort numerically ascending, `-FIELD` to sort numerically
descending, `FIELD` to mean sort ascibetically ascending, `~FIELD` to mean sort
ascibetically descending.


=item B<--ci>, B<-i>

=item B<--filename>=I<s>*, B<-f>

Input CSV file.

Use `-` to read from stdin.


=item B<--hash>, B<-H>

Provide row in $_ as hashref instead of arrayref.

=item B<--no-header>

By default (`--header`), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to contain
field names (and the second row contains the first data row). When you declare
that CSV does not have header row (`--no-header`), the first row of the CSV is
assumed to contain the first data row. Fields will be named `field1`, `field2`,
and so on.


=item B<--reverse>, B<-r>

=item B<--tsv>

Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of CSV.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C csv-sort csv-sort

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete csv-sort 'p/*/`csv-sort`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
