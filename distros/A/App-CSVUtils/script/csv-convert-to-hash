=head1 NAME

csv-convert-to-hash - Return a hash of field names as keys and first row as values

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.036 of csv-convert-to-hash (from Perl distribution App-CSVUtils), released on 2022-02-10.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

% B<csv-convert-to-hash> [B<--escape-char>=I<str>] [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [B<--header>|B<--input-header>|B<--no-header>|B<--noheader>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] [B<--quote-char>=I<str>] [B<--sep-char>=I<str>] [B<--tsv>|B<--input-tsv>|B<--no-tsv>|B<--notsv>] -- E<lt>I<filename>E<gt> [I<row_number>]

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--row-number>=I<s>

Row number (e.g. 2 for first data row).

Default value:

 2

Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument.

=back

=head2 Input options

=over

=item B<--escape-char>=I<s>

Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to `\\` (backslash). Overrides `--tsv` option.


=item B<--filename>=I<s>*, B<-f>

Input CSV file.

Use `-` to read from stdin.


Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--no-header>, B<--input-header>

By default (`--header`), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to contain
field names (and the second row contains the first data row). When you declare
that CSV does not have header row (`--no-header`), the first row of the CSV is
assumed to contain the first data row. Fields will be named `field1`, `field2`,
and so on.


=item B<--quote-char>=I<s>

Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to `"` (double quote). Overrides `--tsv` option.


=item B<--sep-char>=I<s>

Specify field separator character in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to `,` (comma). Overrides `--tsv` option.


=item B<--tsv>, B<--input-tsv>

Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of CSV.

Overriden by `--sep-char`, `--quote-char`, `--escape-char` options. If one of
those options is specified, then `--tsv` will be ignored.


=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C csv-convert-to-hash csv-convert-to-hash

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete csv-convert-to-hash 'p/*/`csv-convert-to-hash`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
