=head1 NAME

dec-pl - Decrement variable using Perl's auto-decrement notion

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of dec-pl (from Perl distribution App-IncrementUtils), released on 2019-01-25.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % dec-pl B b00 2.3
 A
 a99
 1.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This very simple script decrements its arguments using Perl module
L<Data::Decrement>, which basically tries to provide the counterpart to Perl's
C<++> (auto-increment) operator. The auto-increment rules, taken from L<perlop>
and copied here for convenience, are the following:

 The auto-increment operator has a little extra builtin magic to it. If you
 increment a variable that is numeric, or that has ever been used in a numeric
 context, you get a normal increment. If, however, the variable has been used in
 only string contexts since it was set, and has a value that is not the empty
 string and matches the pattern "/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/", the increment is done as
 a string, preserving each character within its range, with carry:

     print ++($foo = "99");      # prints "100"
     print ++($foo = "a0");      # prints "a1"
     print ++($foo = "Az");      # prints "Ba"
     print ++($foo = "zz");      # prints "aaa"

 "undef" is always treated as numeric, and in particular is changed to 0 before
 incrementing (so that a post-increment of an undef value will return 0 rather
 than "undef").

 The auto-decrement operator is not magical.
