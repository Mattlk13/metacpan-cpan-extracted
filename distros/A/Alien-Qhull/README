Alien::Qhull

This module finds or builds the *Qhull* library and executables.

It requires Qhull version '8.0.2'. If that is available on the system,
that is used, otherwise it will build a "share" version using that
version, which is distributed with this package.

  Bundled executables

Qhull provides the following executables:

 qconvex  qdelaunay  qhalf  qhull  qvoronoi  rbox

The Alien::Qhull-bin_dir> will return a valid path if these are
available in a "system" install; they are always available in a "share"
install.
