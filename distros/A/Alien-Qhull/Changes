Revision history for Alien-Qhull

v8.0.2.2  2024-03-06 13:15:09-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD]

    * force share static install.

        Some system installations (e.g. Debian 12) compile their
        static libraries in such a way that linking the Perl .so XS
        module against it fails with something like:

              relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `qh_version2'
              can not be used when making a shared object; recompile
              with -fPIC'

        Alien::Build seems to be passing -fPIC, but the system library
        hasn't been compiled with it.  So, need to use dynamic linking
        against the system library, but want to use static linking for
        a share install.

        However, qhull uses separate .pc files for dynamic and static
        linking, and the PkgConfig plugin really wants to use a single
        file for both. Rather than hand roll the pkg-config gather
        methods (which rely upon the presence of a pkg-config
        executable) constrain PkgConfig use the static one and
        always build a share install.
