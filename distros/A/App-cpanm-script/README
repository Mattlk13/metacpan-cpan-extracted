DESCRIPTION

    cpanm-script is a simplistic wrapper over cpanm. This command:

     % cpanm-script -n csvutil

    will cause cpanm-script to search for the release tarball that contains
    the script (currently via scraping https://metacpan.org/pod/SCRIPTNAME)
    and will then run:

     % cpanm -n PERLANCAR/App-CSVUtils-0.002.tar.gz

    That's about it.
