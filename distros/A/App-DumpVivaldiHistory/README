VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::DumpVivaldiHistory (from
    Perl distribution App-DumpVivaldiHistory), released on 2020-04-19.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included script dump-vivaldi-history.

FUNCTIONS
  dump_vivaldi_history
    Usage:

     dump_vivaldi_history(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Dump Vivaldi history.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   copy_size_limit => *posint* (default: 104857600)

        Vivaldi often locks the History database for a long time. If the
        size of the database is not too large (determine by checking against
        this limit), then the script will copy the file to a temporary file
        and extract the data from the copied database.

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   profiles => *array[vivaldi::profile_name]*

        Select profile(s) to dump.

        You can choose to dump history for only some profiles. By default,
        if this option is not specified, history from all profiles will be
        dumped.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
