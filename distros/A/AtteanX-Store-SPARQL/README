NAME
    AtteanX::Store::SPARQL - Attean SPARQL store

SYNOPSIS
      my $store = Attean->get_store('SPARQL')->new(endpoint_url => $url);

DESCRIPTION
    This implements a simple immutable triple store, which simply allows
    programmers to use Attean facilities to query remote SPARQL endpoints.

    This distribution also brings a corresponding AtteanX::Model::SPARQL,
    which allows query plans to be made, and a AtteanX::Plan::SPARQLBGP plan
    class, which contains a rudimentary cost estimate that attempts to avoid
    sending Cartesian joins to remote endpoints if possible.

  Attributes and methods
    `endpoint_url`
        The URL of a remote SPARQL endpoint. Will be coerced into a URI
        object, so it may be set as a string or whatever. Required attribute.

    `ua`
        An LWP::UserAgent object to use for remote queries. Will be set to a
        reasonable default if not supplied.

    `get_triples`
        Method to query the remote endpoint, as required by
        Attean::API::TripleStore.

    `count_triples`
        Reimplemented using an aggregate query for greater efficiency.

    `get_sparql($sparql, [ $ua ])`
        Will submit the given $sparql query to the above `endpoint_url`
        attribute. Optionally, you may pass an LWP::UserAgent, if not it will
        use the user agent set using the `ua` method. Will return an iterator
        with the results if the request is successful.
