NAME
    App::FileModifyUtils - Utilities related to modifying files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::FileModifyUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-FileModifyUtils), released on 2021-08-02.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   add-line-to-file

    *   remove-line-from-file

FUNCTIONS
  add_line_to_file
    Usage:

     add_line_to_file(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Add line to file.

    Uses Setup::File::Line which supports undo, but the undo feature is not
    used. See App::FileModifyUtils::Undoable for file-modifying CLIs which
    support undo.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   file* => *filename*

    *   line* => *str*

    *   top_style => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  remove_line_from_file
    Usage:

     remove_line_from_file(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Remove all occurrences of a line from file.

    Uses Setup::File::Line which supports undo, but the undo feature is not
    used. See App::FileModifyUtils::Undoable for file-modifying CLIs which
    support undo.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   case_insensitive => *bool*

    *   file* => *filename*

    *   line* => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
