NAME
    App::html2wp - Publish HTML document to WordPress as blog post

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::html2wp (from Perl
    distribution App-html2wp), released on 2020-05-01.

FUNCTIONS
  html2wp
    Usage:

     html2wp(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Publish HTML document to WordPress as blog post.

    To use this program, first create "~/html2wp.conf" containing the API
    credentials, e.g.:

     proxy=https://YOURBLOGNAME.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php
     username=YOURUSERNAME
     password=YOURPASSWORD

    You can also put multiple credentials in the configuration file using
    profile sections, e.g.:

     [profile=blog1]
     proxy=https://YOURBLOG1NAME.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php
     username=YOURUSERNAME
     password=YOURPASSWORD
 
     [profile=blog2]
     proxy=https://YOURBLOG2NAME.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php
     username=YOURUSERNAME
     password=YOURPASSWORD

    and specify which profile you want using command-line option e.g.
    "--config-profile blog1".

    then:

     % html2wp post1.html

    (You should provide blog post title in your HTML in the "<title>" or
    "<meta name="title" content="...">". You can also put categories in
    "<meta name="categories" content="cat1,cat2,...">" and tags in "<meta
    name="tags" content="tag1,tag2,...">".)

    The above command will create a draft post. To publish directly:

     % html2wp post1.html ... --publish

    Note that this will also modify your HTML file and insert this element
    at the beginning of the document:

     <meta name="postid" content="1234">

    where 1234 is the post ID retrieved from the server when creating the
    post.

    After the post is created, you can update using the same command:

     % html2wp post1.html

    You can use "--publish" to publish the post, or "--no-publish" to revert
    it to draft.

    To set more attributes:

     % html2wp post1.html ... --comment-status open \ --extra-attr
         ping_status=closed --extra-attr sticky=1

    Another example, to schedule a post in the future:

     % html2wp post1.html --schedule 20301225T00:00:00

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   comment_status => *str* (default: "closed")

        Whether to allow comments (open) or not (closed).

    *   extra_attrs => *hash*

        Set extra post attributes, e.g. ping_status, post_format, etc.

    *   filename* => *filename*

        Path to HTML document to publish.

    *   password* => *str*

    *   proxy* => *str*

        Example: C<https://YOURBLOGNAME.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php>.

    *   publish => *bool*

        Whether to publish post or make it a draft.

        Equivalent to "--extra-attr post_status=published", while
        "--no-publish" is equivalent to "--extra-attr post_status=draft".

    *   schedule => *date*

        Schedule post to be published sometime in the future.

        Equivalent to "--publish --extra-attr post_date=DATE". Note that
        WordPress accepts date in the "YYYYMMDD"T"HH:MM:SS" format, but you
        specify this option in regular ISO8601 format. Also note that time
        is in your chosen local timezone setting.

    *   username* => *str*

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
