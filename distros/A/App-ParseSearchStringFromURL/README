NAME
    App::ParseSearchStringFromURL - Parse search string from URL

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::ParseSearchStringFromURL
    (from Perl distribution App-ParseSearchStringFromURL), released on
    2021-05-26.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_search_string_from_url
    Usage:

     parse_search_string_from_url(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Parse search string from URL.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

        If set to true, will also output other components aside from search
        string.

    *   module => *str* (default: "URI::ParseSearchString")

    *   urls* => *array[url]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
