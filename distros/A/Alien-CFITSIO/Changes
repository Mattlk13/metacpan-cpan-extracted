Revision history for Alien-CFITSIO

v4.4.0.0  2024-03-04 12:43:10-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * build CFITSIO v4.4.0. Work around change CFITSIO's Makefile.in to
      allow setting DESTDIR in the environment

v4.3.1.0  2024-03-01 15:39:21-05:00 America/New_York

  [CHANGE IN DEFAULT INSTALLED VERSION]

    * The default version of CFITSIO installed has changed from "any
      version greater or equal to this distribution's version" to "the
      version which exactly matches this distribution's version" (ignoring
      the last stanza in the distriution's version)

      The previous behavior was based on the fact that CFITSIO's API
      is very backwards compatible, so pulling in a newer version
      wasn't harmful (except maybe if you're relying upon buggy
      behavior which is fixed in a newer version).

      However, upstream CFITSIO's build process may change for later
      versions, and this module will begin to fail to build through no
      fault of its own, breaking dependencies.

      Forcing an exact version of CFITSIO to be installed should
      alleviate this.
