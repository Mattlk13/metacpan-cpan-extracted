    browser:

    *   kill-opera

    *   opera-has-processes

    *   opera-is-paused

    *   opera-is-running

    *   pause-opera

    *   ps-opera

FUNCTIONS
  opera_has_processes
    Usage:

     opera_has_processes(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Check whether Opera has processes.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  opera_is_paused
    Usage:

     opera_is_paused(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Check whether Opera is paused.

    Opera is defined as paused if *all* of its processes are in 'stop'
    state.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  opera_is_running
    Usage:

     opera_is_running(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Check whether Opera is running.

    Opera is defined as running if there are some Opera processes that are
    *not* in 'stop' state. In other words, if Opera has been started but is
    currently paused, we do not say that it's running. If you want to check
    if Opera process exists, you can use "ps_opera".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)

  pause_opera
    Usage:

     pause_opera(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Pause (kill -STOP) Opera.

    A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite
    browser's power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser
    often still eat considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the
    background. Stopping (kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and
    effective way to stop CPU eating on Unix. It can be performed whenever
    you are not using your browser for a little while, e.g. when you are
    typing on an editor or watching a movie. When you want to use your
    browser again, simply unpause it.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   users => *array[unix::local_uid]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
