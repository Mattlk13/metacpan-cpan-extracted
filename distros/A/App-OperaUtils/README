NAME
    App::OperaUtils - Utilities related to the Opera browser

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of App::OperaUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-OperaUtils), released on 2022-07-24.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to the Opera
    browser:

    *   kill-opera

    *   opera-has-processes

    *   opera-is-paused

    *   opera-is-running

    *   pause-opera

    *   ps-opera

    *   restart-opera

    *   start-opera

    *   terminate-opera

    *   unpause-opera

FUNCTIONS
  opera_has_processes
    Usage:

     opera_has_processes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Opera has processes.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::uid::exists]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  opera_is_paused
    Usage:

     opera_is_paused(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Opera is paused.

    Opera is defined as paused if *all* of its processes are in 'stop'
    state.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::uid::exists]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  opera_is_running
    Usage:

     opera_is_running(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Check whether Opera is running.

    Opera is defined as running if there are some Opera processes that are
    *not* in 'stop' state. In other words, if Opera has been started but is
    currently paused, we do not say that it's running. If you want to check
    if Opera process exists, you can use "ps_opera".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   quiet => *true*

    *   users => *array[unix::uid::exists]*

        Kill browser processes that belong to certain user(s) only.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  pause_opera
    Usage:

     pause_opera(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Pause (kill -STOP) Opera.

    A modern browser now runs complex web pages and applications. Despite
    browser's power management feature, these pages/tabs on the browser
    often still eat considerable CPU cycles even though they only run in the
    background. Pausing (kill -STOP) the browser processes is a simple and
    effective way to stop CPU eating on Unix and prolong your laptop battery
    life. It can be performed whenever you are not using your browser for a
    little while, e.g. when you are typing on an editor or watching a movie.
    When you want to use your browser again, simply unpause (kill -CONT) it.

    This function is not exported.

    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
