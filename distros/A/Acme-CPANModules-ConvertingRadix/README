NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ConvertingRadix - Convert the radix (base) of a
    number from one to another

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ConvertingRadix (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ConvertingRadix), released on 2020-04-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Convert the radix (base) of a number from one to another.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Math::Numseq::RadixConversion

        The list of dependencies seem too much for a simple task: from
        Module::Pluggable to File::HomeDir, Module::Util, and so on. This is
        because the module is part of the distribution of a large family of
        Math::Numseq::* modules.

    *   Number::AnyBase

        Has one non-core dependency: Class::Accessor::Faster.

    *   Math::NumberBase

        No non-core dependency. The OO interface annoys me slightly.

FAQ
  What are ways to use this module?
    Aside from reading it, you can install all the listed modules using
    cpanmodules:

        % cpanmodules ls-entries ConvertingRadix | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=ConvertingRadix -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful result for "lcpan
    related-mods" when it comes to finding related modules for the modules
    listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
