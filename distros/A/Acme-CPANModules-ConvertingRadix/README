NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ConvertingRadix - List of modules to convert the
    radix (base) of a number from one to another

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ConvertingRadix (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ConvertingRadix), released on 2023-08-06.

ACME::CPANMODULES ENTRIES
    Math::Numseq::RadixConversion
        The list of dependencies seem too much for a simple task: from
        Module::Pluggable to File::HomeDir, Module::Util, and so on. This is
        because the module is part of the distribution of a large family of
        Math::Numseq::* modules.

    Number::AnyBase
        Author: EMAZEP <https://metacpan.org/author/EMAZEP>

        Has one non-core dependency: Class::Accessor::Faster.

    Math::NumberBase
        Author: YEHEZKIEL <https://metacpan.org/author/YEHEZKIEL>

        No non-core dependency. The OO interface annoys me slightly.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
