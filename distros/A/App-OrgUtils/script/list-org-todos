=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple application to list todo items in Org files, first created as a
demo for L<Org::Parser>.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--file>=I<filename>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--files-json>=I<filename>

See C<--file>.

=item B<--time-zone>=I<s>

Will be passed to parser's options.

If not set, TZ environment variable will be picked as default.


=item B<--today-json>=I<s>

Assume today's date (JSON-encoded).

See C<--today>.

=item B<--today>=I<s>

Assume today's date.

You can provide Unix timestamp or DateTime object. If you provide a DateTime
object, remember to set the correct time zone.


=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--allow-duplicates>

Whether to allow headline to be listed more than once.

This is only relevant when `group_by_tags` is on. Normally when a headline has
several tags, it will only be listed under its first tag. But when this option
is turned on, the headline will be listed under each of its tag (which mean a
single headline will be listed several times).


=item B<--detail>

Show details instead of just titles.

=item B<--done>

Only show todo items that are done.

=item B<--due-in>=I<s>

Only show todo items that are (nearing|passed) due.

If value is not set, then will use todo item's warning period (or, if todo item
does not have due date or warning period in its due date, will use the default
14 days).

If value is set to something smaller than the warning period, the todo item will
still be considered nearing due when the warning period is passed. For example,
if today is 2011-06-30 and due_in is set to 7, then todo item with due date
<2011-07-10 > won't pass the filter (it's still 10 days in the future, larger
than 7) but <2011-07-10 Sun +1y -14d> will (warning period 14 days is already
passed by that time).


=item B<--from-level>=I<s>

Only show headlines having this level as the minimum.

Default value:

 1

=item B<--group-by-tags>

Whether to group result by tags.

If set to true, instead of returning a list, this function will return a hash of
lists, keyed by tag: {tag1: [hl1, hl2, ...], tag2: [...]}. Note that a headline
that has several tags will only be listed under its first tag, unless when
`allow_duplicates` is set to true, in which case the headline will be listed
under each of its tag.


=item B<--has-tags-json>=I<s>

Only show headlines that have the specified tags (JSON-encoded).

See C<--has-tags>.

=item B<--has-tags>=I<s@>

Only show headlines that have the specified tags.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--lacks-tags-json>=I<s>

Only show headlines that don't have the specified tags (JSON-encoded).

See C<--lacks-tags>.

=item B<--lacks-tags>=I<s@>

Only show headlines that don't have the specified tags.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--maximum-priority>=I<s>

Only show todo items that have at most this priority.

Note that the default priority list is [A, B, C] (A being the highest) and it
can be customized using the `#+PRIORITIES` setting.


=item B<--minimum-priority>=I<s>

Only show todo items that have at least this priority.

Note that the default priority list is [A, B, C] (A being the highest) and it
can be customized using the `#+PRIORITIES` setting.


=item B<--priority>=I<s>

Only show todo items that have this priority.

=item B<--sort-json>=I<s>

Specify sorting (JSON-encoded).

See C<--sort>.

=item B<--sort>=I<s>

Specify sorting.

Default value:

 "due_date"

If string, must be one of 'due_date', '-due_date' (descending).

If code, sorting code will get [REC, DUE_DATE, HL] as the items to compare,
where REC is the final record that will be returned as final result (can be a
string or a hash, if 'detail' is enabled), DUE_DATE is the DateTime object (if
any), and HL is the Org::Headline object.


=item B<--state>=I<s>

Only show todo items that have this state.

=item B<--to-level>=I<s>

Only show headlines having this level as the maximum.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=item B<--with-unknown-priority>

Also show items with no/unknown priority.

Relevant only when used with `minimum_priority` and/or `maximum_priority`.

If this option is turned on, todo items that does not have any priority or have
unknown priorities will *still* be included. Otherwise they will not be
included.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C list-org-todos list-org-todos

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete list-org-todos 'p/*/`list-org-todos`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/list-org-todos.conf>, F<~/list-org-todos.conf>, or F</etc/list-org-todos.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
