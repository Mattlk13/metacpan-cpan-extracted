=head1 NAME

filter-org-by-headlines - Filter Org by headlines

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.471 of filter-org-by-headlines (from Perl distribution App-OrgUtils), released on 2020-12-30.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % filter-org-by-headlines [options] <input>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine uses simple regex instead of Org::Parser, for faster performance.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--input>=I<s>*

Value is either a string or an array of strings.


=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--ascendant-match>=I<s>

Only include headline whose ascendant matches this.

Value is either a string or a regex. If string is in the form of `/.../` or
`/.../i` it is assumed to be a regex.


=item B<--has-tag>=I<s@>

Only include headline which have all these tags.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--has-tags-json>=I<s>

Only include headline which have all these tags (JSON-encoded).

See C<--has-tag>.

=item B<--is-done>

Only include headline which is a done todo item.

=item B<--is-todo>

Only include headline which is a todo item.

=item B<--lacks-tag>=I<s@>

Only include headline which lack all these tags.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--lacks-tags-json>=I<s>

Only include headline which lack all these tags (JSON-encoded).

See C<--lacks-tag>.

=item B<--level>=I<s>

=item B<--match>=I<s>

Only include headline which matches this.

Value is either a string or a regex. If string is in the form of `/.../` or
`/.../i` it is assumed to be a regex.


=item B<--max-level>=I<s>

=item B<--min-level>=I<s>

=item B<--parent-match>=I<s>

Only include headline whose parent matches this.

Value is either a string or a regex. If string is in the form of `/.../` or
`/.../i` it is assumed to be a regex.


=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Result options

=over

=item B<--return-array>

Return array of strings instead of strings.

=item B<--without-content>

Don't include headline content, just print the headlines.

=item B<--without-preamble>

Don't include text before any headline.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C filter-org-by-headlines filter-org-by-headlines

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete filter-org-by-headlines 'p/*/`filter-org-by-headlines`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
