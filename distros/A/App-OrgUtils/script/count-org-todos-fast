=head1 NAME

count-org-todos-fast - Count Org todos

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.476 of count-org-todos-fast (from Perl distribution App-OrgUtils), released on 2020-04-18.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % count-org-todos-fast [options] <input>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine uses simple regex instead of Org::Parser, for faster performance.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--input>=I<s>*

Value is either a string or an array of strings.


=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--ascendant-match>=I<s>

Only include headline whose ascendant matches this.

Value is either a string or a regex. If string is in the form of `/.../` or
`/.../i` it is assumed to be a regex.


=item B<--has-tag>=I<s@>

Only include headline which have all these tags.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--has-tags-json>=I<s>

Only include headline which have all these tags (JSON-encoded).

See C<--has-tag>.

=item B<--is-done>

Only include headline which is a done todo item.

=item B<--lacks-tag>=I<s@>

Only include headline which lack all these tags.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--lacks-tags-json>=I<s>

Only include headline which lack all these tags (JSON-encoded).

See C<--lacks-tag>.

=item B<--level>=I<s>

=item B<--match>=I<s>

Only include headline which matches this.

Value is either a string or a regex. If string is in the form of `/.../` or
`/.../i` it is assumed to be a regex.


=item B<--max-level>=I<s>

=item B<--min-level>=I<s>

=item B<--parent-match>=I<s>

Only include headline whose parent matches this.

Value is either a string or a regex. If string is in the form of `/.../` or
`/.../i` it is assumed to be a regex.


=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back
