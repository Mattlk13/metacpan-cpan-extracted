NAME
    App::CPANStreaks - Calculate various CPAN streaks

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of App::CPANStreaks (from Perl
    distribution App-CPANStreaks), released on 2023-12-11.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  cpan_streaks
    Usage:

     cpan_streaks(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Calculate and display CPAN streaks.

    This utility calculates one of various CPAN streaks, e.g.
    "daily-releases" to see which authors have the longest streaks of
    releasing at least one CPAN distribution daily.

    The data used to calculate the streaks are CPAN module releases packaged
    in TableData::Perl::CPAN::Release::Static::GroupedDaily,
    TableData::Perl::CPAN::Release::Static::GroupedWeekly, and
    TableData::Perl::CPAN::Release::Static::GroupedMonthly, so make you
    update those modules first from CPAN. These modules in turn get the data
    from MetaCPAN API from <https://metacpan.org>.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   action* => *str* (default: "calculate")

        (No description)

    *   author => *cpan::pause_id*

        Only calculate streaks for certain authors.

    *   exclude_broken => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   min_len => *posint*

        (No description)

    *   table => *str*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
