NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ArrayClassBuilder - List of class builders for
    array-backed classes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ArrayClassBuilder (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ArrayClassBuilder), released on 2022-03-08.

DESCRIPTION
    This list catalogs class builders for classes that use array (instead of
    the popular hash) as their backend storage.

    Hash is the vastly popular backend for object due to its flexibility and
    convenient mapping of hash keys to object attributes, but actually Perl
    objects can be references to any kind of data (array, scalar, glob).
    Storing objects as other kinds of references can be useful in terms of
    attribute access speed, memory size, or other aspects. But they are not
    as versatile and generic as hash.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n ArrayClassBuilder

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries ArrayClassBuilder | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=ArrayClassBuilder -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::ArrayClassBuilder -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::ArrayClassBuilder::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
