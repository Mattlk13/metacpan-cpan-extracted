NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ArrayClassBuilder - Class builders for array-backed
    classes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ArrayClassBuilder (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ArrayClassBuilder), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Class builders for array-backed classes.

    This list catalogs class builders for classes that use array (instead of
    the popular hash) as their backend storage.

    Hash is the vastly popular backend for object due to its flexibility and
    convenient mapping of hash keys to object attributes, but actually Perl
    objects can be references to any kind of data (array, scalar, glob).
    Storing objects as other kinds of references can be useful in terms of
    attribute access speed, memory size, or other aspects. But they are not
    as versatile and generic as hash.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   Class::Accessor::Array

    *   Class::Accessor::Array::Glob

    *   Class::XSAccessor::Array

    *   Class::ArrayObjects

    *   Object::ArrayType::New - Only supports defining constants for array
        indexes
