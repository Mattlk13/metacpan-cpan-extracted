=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify arguments to modify corresponding fields. Unspecified fields will not be
modified.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--backup>

Whether to backup when modifying files.

Backup is written with `.bak` extension in the same directory. Unmodified file
will not be backed up. Previous backup will be overwritten.


=item B<--encpass>=I<s>

Encrypted password.

=item B<--expire-date>=I<s>

The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970.

=item B<--gecos>=I<s>

Usually, it contains the full username.

=item B<--gid>=I<s>

Numeric primary group ID for this user.

=item B<--home>=I<s>

User's home directory.

=item B<--last-pwchange>=I<s>

The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970..

=item B<--max-pass-age>=I<s>

The number of days after which the user will have to change her password.

=item B<--min-pass-age>=I<s>

The number of days the user will have to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again.

=item B<--pass-inactive-period>=I<s>

The number of days after a password has expired (see max_pass_age) during which the password should still be accepted (and user should update her password during the next login).

=item B<--pass-warn-period>=I<s>

The number of days before a password is going to expire (see max_pass_age) during which the user should be warned.

=item B<--shell>=I<s>

User's shell.

=item B<--uid>=I<s>

Numeric user ID.

=item B<--user>=I<s>*

User (login) name.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--etc-dir>=I<s>

Specify location of passwd files.

Default value:

 "/etc"

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C upf-modify-user upf-modify-user

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete upf-modify-user 'p/*/`upf-modify-user`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
