=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--backup>

=item B<--gid>=I<s>

Pick a specific GID when creating group.

Duplicate GID is allowed.


=item B<--group>=I<s>

Select primary group (default is group with same name as user).

Normally, a user's primary group with group with the same name as user, which
will be created if does not already exist. You can pick another group here,
which must already exist (and in this case, the group with the same name as user
will not be created).


=item B<--home>=I<s>

=item B<--last-pwchange>=I<s>

The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970..

=item B<--max-gid>=I<s>

Pick a range for GID when creating group.

=item B<--max-pass-age>=I<s>

The number of days after which the user will have to change her password.

=item B<--max-uid>=I<s>

Pick a range for new UID.

Default value:

 65535

If a free UID between `min_uid` and `max_uid` is not found, error 412 is
returned.


=item B<--min-gid>=I<s>

Pick a range for GID when creating group.

=item B<--min-pass-age>=I<s>

The number of days the user will have to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again.

=item B<--min-uid>=I<s>

Pick a range for new UID.

Default value:

 1000

If a free UID between `min_uid` and `max_uid` is not found, error 412 is
returned.


=item B<--pass-inactive-period>=I<s>

The number of days after a password has expired (see max_pass_age) during which the password should still be accepted (and user should update her password during the next login).

=item B<--pass-warn-period>=I<s>

The number of days before a password is going to expire (see max_pass_age) during which the user should be warned.

=item B<--pass>=I<s>

=item B<--user>=I<s>*

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--etc-dir>=I<s>

Specify location of passwd files.

Default value:

 "/etc"

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete upf-add-user 'p/*/`upf-add-user`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).
