=head1 NAME

upf-add-delete-user-groups - Add or delete user from one or several groups

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.060 of upf-add-delete-user-groups (from Perl distribution App-UpfUtils), released on 2020-04-29.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % upf-add-delete-user-groups [--add-to-json=s] [--add-to=s+]
     [--delete-from-json=s] [--delete-from=s+] [--etc-dir=s]
     [--format=name] [--json] [--(no)naked-res] [--page-result[=program]]
     <user>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This can be used to reduce several C<add_user_to_group()> and/or
C<delete_user_from_group()> calls to a single call. So:

 add_delete_user_groups(user=>'u',add_to=>['a','b'],delete_from=>['c','d']);

is equivalent to:

 add_user_to_group     (user=>'u', group=>'a');
 add_user_to_group     (user=>'u', group=>'b');
 delete_user_from_group(user=>'u', group=>'c');
 delete_user_from_group(user=>'u', group=>'d');

except that C<add_delete_user_groups()> does it in one pass.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--add-to-json>=I<s>

List of group names to add the user as member of (JSON-encoded).

See C<--add-to>.

=item B<--add-to>=I<s@>

List of group names to add the user as member of.

Default value:

 []

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--delete-from-json>=I<s>

List of group names to remove the user as member of (JSON-encoded).

See C<--delete-from>.

=item B<--delete-from>=I<s@>

List of group names to remove the user as member of.

Default value:

 []

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--user>=I<s>*

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--etc-dir>=I<s>

Specify location of passwd files.

Default value:

 "/etc"

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C upf-add-delete-user-groups upf-add-delete-user-groups

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete upf-add-delete-user-groups 'p/*/`upf-add-delete-user-groups`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
