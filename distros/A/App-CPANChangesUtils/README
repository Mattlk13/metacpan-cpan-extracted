NAME
    App::CPANChangesUtils - Parse CPAN Changes file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.076 of App::CPANChangesUtils (from
    Perl distribution App-CPANChangesUtils), released on 2022-06-10.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides some CLI utilities related to CPAN Changes

FUNCTIONS
  format_cpan_changes
    Usage:

     format_cpan_changes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Format CPAN Changes.

    This utility is a simple wrapper to CPAN::Changes. It will parse your
    CPAN Changes file into data structure, then use "serialize()" to format
    it back to text form.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   class => *perl::modname* (default: "CPAN::Changes")

    *   file => *filename*

        If not specified, will look for file called Changes/ChangeLog in
        current directory.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  parse_cpan_changes
    Usage:

     parse_cpan_changes(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Parse CPAN Changes file.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         parse_cpan_changes();

        Result:

         [
           200,
           "OK",
           {

           {},

    This utility is a simple wrapper for CPAN::Changes.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   class => *perl::modname* (default: "CPAN::Changes")

    *   file => *filename*

        If not specified, will look for file called Changes/ChangeLog in
        current directory.

    *   parse_release_metadata => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to parse release metadata in release note.

        If set to true (the default), the utility will attempt to parse
        release metadata in the release note. The release note is the text
        after the version and date in the first line of a release entry:

         0.001 - 2022-06-10 THIS IS THE RELEASE NOTE AND CAN BE ANY TEXT

        One convention I use is for the release note to be
        semicolon-separated of metadata entries, where each metadata is in
        the form of HTTP-header-like "Name: Value" text where Name is
        dash-separated words and Value is any text that does not contain
        newline or semicolon. Example:

         0.001 - 2022-06-10  Urgency: high; Backward-Incompatible: yes

        Note that Debian changelog also supports "key=value" in the release
        line.

        This option, when enabled, will first check if the release note is
        indeed in the form of semicolon-separated metadata. If yes, will
        create a key called "metadata" in the release result structure
        containing a hash of metadata:

         { "urgency" => "high", "backward-incompatible" => "yes" }

        Note that the metadata names are converted to lowercase.

    *   unbless => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to return Perl objects as unblessed refs.

        If you set this to false, you'll need to use an output format that
        can handle serializing Perl objects, e.g. on the CLI using
        "--format=perl".

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
