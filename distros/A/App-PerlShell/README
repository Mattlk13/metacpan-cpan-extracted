App::PerlShell
==============

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

FEATURES

The shell supports Perl commands.  It can be assigned a package on 
start and change packages while in the shell.  Lexical persistence 
is supported using "my" to declare all variables and keep them between 
successive commands (not restarts of the shell environment) if 
Lexical::Persistence is installed.  Used modules in the shell are 
updated automatically if they change on disk if Module::Refresh is 
installed.

DEPENDENCIES

For command recall using the up/down arrows in *nix, you will need 
Term::ReadLine::Gnu installed.  This module will function fine without 
it as Term::ReadLine is a core module; however, command recall using 
the up/down arrows will not work.
