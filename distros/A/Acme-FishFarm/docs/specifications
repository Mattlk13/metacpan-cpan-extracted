Specification for Acme::FishFarm v0.01

Only allow installation of a system once, however, make it changable

1. Acme::FishFarming will contain the five main systems functions
   -Maybe sub them into individual class, so this class will just contain some general
    subroutines to access the sub-classes
    
2. Acme::FishFarm will contain these subroutines for X system
   -install_X() : instantiate Acme::FishFarm::X
   -install( systems => ["X1", "X2", "X3"] )
    -X refers to a general system name and not the module name
   -install_all_systems(): installs all the Acme::FishFarm::* systems
   -check_X() : return values of sensors or whatever for system X
   -all_systems_report() : returns a hash of all the systems with corresponding sensor
                           values

2.1 Acme::FishFarm::WaterLevelMaintainer
2.2 Acme::FishFarm::Feeder
2.3 Acme::FishFarm::WaterFiltration
2.4 Acme::FishFarm::WaterConditionMonitor
2.5 Acme::FishFarm::OxygenMaintainer

2.6 A few systems has some mechanism that can't work by itself and require explicit action, these include:
    - Acme::FishFarm::Feeder
      * timer needs to be ticked from time to time
    - Acme::FishFarm::OxygenMaintainer
      * oxygen needs to be generated constantly if DO is lower than threshold
    - Acme::FishFarm::WaterLevelMaintainer
      * water needs to be pumped constantly if water level is lower than threshold
    - Acme::FishFarm::WaterConditionMonitor
      * the long buzzer needs to be turned on explicitely
There's really no obvious reason why this is so, it's just what and how I want the method names to be :)

3. Actual script:
3.1 Use YAML as config file, this file will be read every t seconds and the 
    program will react accordingly to the new data
3.2 Use lib so that the modules can be moved together with the scripts
    -Compile the script into an executable just in case
3.3 There will be a loop to make everything work, this is a full program
3.4 Implement randomness here and there if possible

4. YAML
YAML file will contain the following:


5. Execution of script
Since the script will be compiled, and a config file is used, use @ARGV to get the 
config file name
Compile under linux and windows (to do last)
