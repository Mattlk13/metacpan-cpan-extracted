Acme-FishFarm (Version 1.00)

This is a module for creating a virtual fish farm (aquaculture) with automated systems. 

This module is not meant to implement everything found in the real aquaculture field. As a 
matter of fact, this is part of an assignment which I think it would be good to pack those 
features into a module.

This module might probably be good for fun :)

The Acme::FishFarm distribution comes along with several other related modules. These are 
the automated systems used in aquaculture. These modules are:

1. Acme::FishFarm::Feeder
2. Acme::FishFarm::WaterFiltration
3. Acme::FishFarm::WaterLevelMaintainer
4. Acme::FishFarm::WaterConditionMonitor
5. Acme::FishFarm::OxygenMaintainer

The offline documentations for all these modules can be found in the "docs" directory.
