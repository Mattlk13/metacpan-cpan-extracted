=head1 NAME

dump-scriptx-script - Run a Getopt::Long-based script but only to dump the import arguments

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of dump-scriptx-script (from Perl distribution App-ScriptXUtils), released on 2020-10-01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % dump-scriptx-script [-D] [-I=s+] [--format=name] [--json] [--lib=s+]
     [--libs-json=s] [--(no)naked-res] [--page-result[=program]]
     [--skip-detect] <filename>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function runs a CLI script that uses C<ScriptX> but monkey-patches
beforehand so that C<import()> will dump the import arguments and then exit. The
goal is to get the import arguments without actually running the script.

This can be used to gather information about the script and then generate
documentation about it or do other things (e.g. C<App::shcompgen> to generate a
completion script for the original script).

CLI script needs to use C<ScriptX>. This is detected currently by a simple regex.
If script is not detected as using C<Getopt::Long>, status 412 is returned.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--filename>=I<s>*, B<-f>

Path to the script.

=item B<--lib>=I<s@>, B<-I>

Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--libs-json>=I<s>

Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script (JSON-encoded).

See C<--lib>.

=item B<--skip-detect>, B<-D>

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C dump-scriptx-script dump-scriptx-script

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete dump-scriptx-script 'p/*/`dump-scriptx-script`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
