NAME
    App::ColorThemeUtils - CLI utilities related to color themes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.011 of App::ColorThemeUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-ColorThemeUtils), released on 2021-08-08.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains the following CLI utilities:

    *   list-color-theme-items

    *   list-color-theme-modules

    *   show-color-theme-swatch

FUNCTIONS
  list_color_theme_items
    Usage:

     list_color_theme_items(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   theme* => *perl::modname_with_optional_args*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_color_theme_modules
    Usage:

     list_color_theme_modules(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List ColorTheme modules.
