NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::MIMETypes - List of modules to work with MIME types

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::MIMETypes
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-MIMETypes), released on
    2023-06-30.

DESCRIPTION
    All recipes are categorized by tasks, then by most recommended module.

    1. Finding out filename extensions for a certain MIME type

    1a. With File::MimeInfo (uses system's type database):

     use File::MimeInfo qw(extensions);
     $ext  = extensions("image/jpeg"); # => "jpeg"
     @exts = extensions("image/jpeg"); # => ("jpeg", "jpe", "jpg")

    1b. With MIME::Types (comes with its own type database):

     use MIME::Types;
     my $mt = MIME::Types->new->type("image/jpeg") or die "Unknown MIME type";
     my @exts = $m->extensions; # => ("jpeg", "jpg", "jpe", "jfif", "jfif-tbnl")

    1c. With Media::Type::Simple (can uses system's "/etc/mime.types"):

     use Media::Type::Simple;
     $ext  = ext_from_type("image/jpeg"); # => "jpeg"
     @exts = ext_from_type("image/jpeg"); # => ("jpeg", "jpg", "jpe", "jfif")

    2. Finding out the MIME type associated with a certain filename
    extension

    2a. With MIME::Types:

     use MIME::Types;
     my $mt = MIME::Types->new->mimeTypeOf("gif") or die "Unknown MIME type";
     say "$mt" ;# => "image/gif"

    2b. With Media::Type::Simple:

     use Media::Type::Simple;
     $type = type_from_ext("jpg"); # => "image/jpeg"

    2c. With MIME::Type::FileName (comes with its own type database, last
    updated 2012):

     use MIME::Type::FileName;
     my $mimetype = MIME::Type::FileName::guess ("my-file.xls") or die "Unknown MIME type";

    3. Guessing MIME type of a file based on its extension

    3a. With File::MimeInfo:

     use File::MimeInfo;
     my $mime_type = mimetype('test.png') or die "Unknown MIME type";

    3b. With LWP::MediaTypes (comes with its own type database):

     use LWP::MediaTypes;
     my $type = LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type("file.xls") or die "Unknown MIME type";

    4. Guessing MIME type of a file based on its content

    4a. Using File::MimeInfo::Magic (same interface as File::MimeInfo):

     use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
 
     $type = mimetype("file.jpg"); # => "image/jpeg"
 
     # For symlink, will return "octet/symlink". To follow symlink, open file and
     # pass filehandle.
     open my $fh, "<", "symlink-to-file.jpg" or die "Can't open file: $!";
     $type = mimetype($fh); # => "image/jpeg"

    4b. Using other modules:

    Alien::LibMagic

    File::LibMagic::FFI

    File::MMagic

    File::MMagic::XS

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n MIMETypes

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries MIMETypes | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=MIMETypes -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::MIMETypes -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::MIMETypes::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
