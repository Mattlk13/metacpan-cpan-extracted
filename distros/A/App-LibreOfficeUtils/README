FUNCTIONS
  delete_libreoffice_profile
    Usage:

     delete_libreoffice_profile() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Delete LibreOffice user profile.

    When your LibreOffice crashes and you look for help, a common thing
    people tell you is to reset your user profile or start in safe mode.
    This user profile is a directory of files which LibreOffice itself
    writes but due to some reason will often gets corrupted. (As to why
    LibreOffice gets confused by things it itself writes, is left for us to
    wonder.) This script will help delete your user profile.

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
