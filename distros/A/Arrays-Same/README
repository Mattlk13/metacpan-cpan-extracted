NAME
    Arrays::Same - Test if two arrays are identical

SYNOPSIS
            use Arrays::Same -all;
        
            if (arrays_same_i(\@a, \@b)) {
                    ...;
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports two XS functions which test whether a pair of arrays
    are identical. To be considered identical, the arrays must be of equal
    length, and contain the same elements in the same order:

    The `arrays_same_i` function compares the elements as integers.

    The `arrays_same_s` function compares the elements as strings, and is
    case-sensitive.

    Both functions make the assumption that the arrays are simple lists of
    non-reference scalars. They do not support overloading, etc, but dualvars
    should work.
