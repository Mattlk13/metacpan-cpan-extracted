          ],
          execute => sub ($instance) {
             my $foo = $instance->config('foo');
             say "Hello, $foo!";
             return 0;
          },
          default_child => '-self',    # run execute by default
          children => [
             {
                aliases => ['bar'],
                help => 'this is a sub-command',
                description => 'Yes, this is a sub-command',
                execute => sub { 'Peace!' },
             },
          ],
       };
       exit run($app, $0, @ARGV);

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: this software should be considered "late alpha" maturity. I'm
    mostly happy with the interface, but there are still a few things that
    might get changed. Anyway, if you find a release of App::Easer to work
    fine for you, it's fair to assume that you will not need to get a newer
    one later.

    App::Easer provides the scaffolding for implementing hierarchical
    command-line applications in a very fast way.

    Development today happens only in App::Easer::V2. The legacy interface
    is still available in App::Easer::V1, which is also the default but has
    its own documentation.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    Minimum perl version 5.24.
