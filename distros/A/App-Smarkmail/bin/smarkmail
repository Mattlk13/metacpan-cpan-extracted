=head1 NAME

smarkmail - send email, converting plain text to multipart/alternative + HTML

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 PERL VERSION SUPPORT

This module has the same support period as perl itself:  it supports the two
most recent versions of perl.  (That is, if the most recently released version
is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
the minimum required perl.

=head1 USAGE

 smarkmail [ -f sender ] <recipient ... >

 -f  - envelope recipient; otherwise taken from email From header
