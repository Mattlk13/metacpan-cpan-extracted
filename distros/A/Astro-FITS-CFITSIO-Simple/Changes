0.13 :  2005-08-22T16:42:53+00:00

  [OOPS]

    * It turns out that this module was developed against a patched,
      non-distributed version of Astro::FITS::Header 2.8.1
      Unfortunately, that version is required for this module to work.
      The patches are available here:

             https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=4816
             https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=11722

  [BUILD]

    * minor error formatting output fixes.


0.12 :  2005-05-12T15:54:12+00:00

  [BUG FIX]

    * test for inappropriate call in scalar context when reading
      multiple columns was broken

0.11 :  2005-05-11T19:37:27+00:00

  [BUG FIX]

    * when processing bit fields as bits (not logicals), the ENTIRE
      destination piddle was set to zero, for each chunk, not just the
      destination for the current chunk.  this resulted not only in
      bogus data, but also slowed things down TREMENDOUSLY.

0.1 :   2005-05-11T13:58:59+00:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * much improved support for bit fields; now can either map bit for
      bit or as logicals

    * status output

    * can specify columns to *not* read

0.03 :  2004-10-19T17:22:42+00:00

  [BUG FIX]

    * retinfo=1 resulted in the original, unfiltered data, being
      returned

0.02 :  2004-04-12T22:22:51+00:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * "supports" TULONG and TUINT.  not really. it just points them at
    long(), which is wrong.  But, PDL has no uint or ulong types.

0.01 :  2004-04-07T21:22:43+00:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
