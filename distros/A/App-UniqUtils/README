NAME
    App::UniqUtils - Utilities related to unique lines and/or Unix uniq
    utility

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::UniqUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-UniqUtils), released on 2022-08-08.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   lookup-lines

FUNCTIONS
  lookup_lines
    Usage:

     lookup_lines(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Report or omit lines found in another "reference" file.

    By default will report lines that are found in the reference file
    (unless when "-v" a.k.a. "--invert-match" option is specified, in which
    case will report lines that are *not* found in reference file).

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        By default the utility will report lines that are found in the
        reference file. If this option is specified, then will instead
        report lines that are *not* found in reference file.

    *   reference_file* => *filename*

        Path to reference file.

    *   test_files => *array[filename]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
