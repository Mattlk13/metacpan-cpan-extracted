=head1 NAME

gen-pericmd-completer - Generate Perinci::CmdLine completer script

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.120 of gen-pericmd-completer (from Perl distribution App-GenPericmdCompleterScript), released on 2018-09-11.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % gen-pericmd-completer [options] <program_name> <url>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--exclude-package-functions-match>=I<s>

Exclude package functions matching this pattern.

=item B<--include-package-functions-match>=I<s>

Only include package functions matching this pattern.

=item B<--interpreter-path>=I<s>

What to put on shebang line.

=item B<--load-module-json>=I<s>

Load extra modules (JSON-encoded).

See C<--load-module>.

=item B<--load-module>=I<s@>

Load extra modules.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--program-name>=I<s>*

Program name that is being completed.

=item B<--strip>

Whether to strip source code using Perl::Stripper.

=item B<--subcommands-from-package-functions>

Form subcommands from functions under package's URL.

This is an alternative to the `subcommand` option. Instead of specifying each
subcommand's name and URL, you can also specify that subcommand names are from
functions under the package URL in `url`. So for example if `url` is `/My/App/`,
hen all functions under `/My/App` are listed first. If the functions are:

    foo
    bar
    baz_qux

then the subcommands become:

    foo => /My/App/foo
    bar => /My/App/bar
    "baz-qux" => /My/App/baz_qux


=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--output-file>=I<filename>, B<-o>

Path to output file.

Default value:

 "-"

=item B<--overwrite>

Whether to overwrite output if previously exists.

=back

=head2 Pericmd attribute options

=over

=item B<--completion-json>=I<s>

See C<--completion>.

=item B<--completion>=I<s>

=item B<--default-subcommand>=I<s>

=item B<--get-subcommand-from-arg>=I<s>

Default value:

 1

Valid values:

 [0,1,2]

=item B<--per-arg-json>

=item B<--per-arg-yaml>

=item B<--read-config>

=item B<--read-env>

=item B<--skip-format>

=item B<--subcommands-json>=I<s>, B<-s>

Hash of subcommand names and function URLs (JSON-encoded).

See C<--subcommands>.

=item B<--subcommands>=I<s>

Hash of subcommand names and function URLs.

Optionally, it can be additionally followed by a summary, so:

    URL[:SUMMARY]

Example (on CLI):

    --subcommand "delete=/My/App/delete_item:Delete an item"


=item B<--url>=I<s>*

URL to function (or package, if you have subcommands).

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C gen-pericmd-completer gen-pericmd-completer

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete gen-pericmd-completer 'p/*/`gen-pericmd-completer`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/gen-pericmd-completer.conf>, F<~/gen-pericmd-completer.conf>, or F</etc/gen-pericmd-completer.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
