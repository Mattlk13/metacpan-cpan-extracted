=head1 NAME

pllines - Count line numbers of Perl programs

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.122 of pllines (from Perl distribution App-PlUtils), released on 2020-04-29.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % pllines dzil /home/ujang/bin/myscript

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility uses L<SourceCode::LineCounter::Perl> to count lines of
{code,POD,blank,comment} in a specified Perl script.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--file-json>=I<s>

Perl script (JSON-encoded).

See C<--file>.

=item B<--file>=I<s@>*

Perl script.

For convenience, if filename does not contain path separator, it will first be
searched in the current directory, then in `PATH` (using `File::Which`).


Can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pllines pllines

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pllines 'p/*/`pllines`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-PlUtils>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<App::cloc> which uses the B<cloc> program and can output number of
{code,blank,comment} lines in a Perl source code (as well as other languages).
Results might differ slightly with result from this utility.
