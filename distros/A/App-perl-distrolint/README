NAME

    App::perl::distrolint - distribution-wide linting tools for Perl
    distributions

SYNOPSIS

       use App::perl::distrolint;
    
       exit App::perl::distrolint->new->run( @ARGV );

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements an application for applying various code-linting
    tests across the source code for an entire Perl distribution. The
    individual checks performed are described more in the various
    App::perl::distrolint::Check::* modules.

    At present in this very early version, many of these checks are very
    opinionated, doing things specific to the way I personally lay out my
    code. I fully imagine that at some point I'll get around to adding more
    flexibility here, via some kind of configuration system, whereby other
    users can change or disable various checks as they see fit to suit
    their own coding style. This distribution currently exists largely to
    allow people to see the kinds of things that are possible, and also
    acts as a demonstration of the use of Text::Treesitter and
    tree-sitter-perl to be used as a static linting tool for Perl source
    code.
