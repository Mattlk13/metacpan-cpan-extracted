NAME

    tarweb - Open an archive file in your web browser!

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    Starts a HTTP server locally, and opens it in your web browser

     $ tarweb [ options ] foo.tar.gz

DESCRIPTION

    This is a hybrid CLI/Web app that opens an archive in your browser so
    that you can browse the content. Internally it uses libarchive
    <https://libarchive.org>, so any format it supports is supported by
    this application.

    This command accepts that same options as plackup. Unlike plackup if
    you do not specify a port, a random port will be used instead of using
    port 5000 so that multiple instances of this app can run at the same
    time.
