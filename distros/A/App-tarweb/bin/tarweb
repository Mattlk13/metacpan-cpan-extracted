=head1 NAME

tarweb - Open an archive file in your web browser!

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Starts a HTTP server locally, and opens it in your web browser

 $ tarweb [ options ] foo.tar.gz

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a hybrid CLI/Web app that opens an archive in your browser
so that you can browse the content.  Internally it uses
L<libarchive|https://libarchive.org>, so any format it supports is
supported by this application.

This command accepts that same options as L<plackup>.  Unlike
L<plackup> if you do not specify a port, a random port will
be used instead of using port C<5000> so that multiple instances
of this app can run at the same time.
