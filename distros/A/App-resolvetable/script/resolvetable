=head1 NAME

resolvetable - Produce a colored table containing DNS resolve results of several names from several servers/resolvers

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.008 of resolvetable (from Perl distribution App-resolvetable), released on 2021-07-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % resolvetable [--action=s] [--colorize] [--compare] [--debug]
     [--format-options=s] [--format=name] [--json] [--log-level=level]
     [--(no)naked-res] [--name=s+] [--names-json=s] [--no-colorize]
     [--nocolorize] [--quiet] [-s=s+] [--server=s+] [--servers-json=s]
     [-t=s] [--timings] [--trace] [--type=s] [--verbose] -- <name> ...

Examples:

 % cat names.txt | resolvetable -s 8.8.8.8 -s my.dns.server -s my2.dns.server

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--action>=I<s>

Default value:

 "show-addresses"

Valid values:

 ["show-addresses","compare-addresses","show-timings"]

The default action is to show resolve result (`show-addresses`). Will highlight
the majority result with green, and minority result with red. Failed resolve
(undef) will also be highlighted with a red "X".

The `compare-addresses` action is similar to `show-addresses`, but will assume
the first server/resolver as the reference and compare the results of the other
servers with the first. When the result is different, it will be highlighted
with red; when the result is the same, it will be highlighted with green. Failed
resolve (undef) are highlighted with a grey X (if result is the same as
reference server) or a red X (if result is different than reference server). So
basically whenever you see a red, the results of the other servers are not
identical with the first (reference) server.

The `show-timings` action will show resolve times instead of addresses, to
compare speed among DNS servers/resolvers. Will highlight the fastest server
with green.


=item B<--compare>

Shortcut for --action=compare-addresses.

See C<--action>.

=item B<--name>=I<s@>*

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--names-json>=I<s>

See C<--name>.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

=item B<--no-colorize>

=item B<--server>=I<s@>*, B<-s>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--servers-json>=I<s>

See C<--server>.

=item B<--timings>

Shortcut for --action=show-timings.

See C<--action>.

=item B<--type>=I<s>, B<-t>

Type of DNS record to query.

Default value:

 "A"

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format-options>=I<s>

Pass options to formatter.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Equivalent to --format=json-pretty.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C resolvetable resolvetable

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete resolvetable 'p/*/`resolvetable`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
