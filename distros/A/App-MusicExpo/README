App-MusicExpo version 1.002001
==============================

App::MusicExpo creates a HTML table from a list of songs.

The default template (named index.tmpl here) looks like:

    | Title   | Artist  | Album           | Genre   | Track | Year | Type |
    |---------+---------+-----------------+---------+-------+------+------|
    | Cellule | Silence | L'autre endroit | Electro | 01/09 | 2005 | FLAC |

where the title is a download link. If you have multiple files with the same
basename (such as C<cellule.flac> and C<cellule.ogg>), they will be treated
as two versions of the same file, so a row will be created with two download
links, one for each format.
