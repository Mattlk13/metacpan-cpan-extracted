NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::CountryCodes - List of modules related to country
    codes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Acme::CPANModules::CountryCodes
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-CountryCodes), released on
    2023-10-20.

DESCRIPTION
  Basics
    Locale::Country and Locale::Codes::Country (both part of Locale::Codes
    now) should be your first go-to module. They are core modules since perl
    5.14 (Locale::Country from 5.8) and they support converting between
    English country names and 2-letter- and 3-letter ISO country codes, and
    retired codes. If you need to squeeze some milliseconds of loading time,
    you can use Locale::Codes::Country_Codes directly.

  Multilingual
    There are some modules for non-English country names, e.g.
    Locale::Codes::Country::FR (for French). There is also
    Locale::Country::Multilingual to map ISO codes to localized country
    names.

  Subcountries
    Locale::SubCountry

  Types
    Sah: Sah::Schema::country::code, Sah::Schema::country::code::alpha2,
    Sah::Schema::country::code::alpha3.

    Moose: MooseX::Types::Locale::Country,
    MooseX::Types::Locale::Country::Fast.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
