=head1 NAME

prove-author - Prove distributions of a CPAN author

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of prove-author (from Perl distribution App-ProveAuthor), released on 2020-03-25.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % prove-author [options] <author>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To use this utility, first create C<~/.config/prove-author.conf>:

 dists_dirs = ~/repos
 dists_dirs = ~/repos-other

The above tells I<prove-author> where to look for Perl distributions. Then:

 % prove-author PERLANCAR

This will search local CPAN mirror for all distributions that belong to that
author, then search the distributions in the distribution directories (or
download them from local CPAN mirror), C<cd> to each and run C<prove> in it.

You can run with C<--dry-run> (C<-n>) option first to not actually run C<prove> but
just see what distributions will get tested. An example output:

 % prove-author GRAVATTJ -n
 prove-author: Found dist: Backup-Duplicity-YADW
 prove-author: Found dist: Backup-EZ
 prove-author: Found dist: CLI-Driver
 prove-author: Found dist: File-RandomGenerator
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-ORM
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-QueryMulti
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-Util
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-Util-Lite-ForeignKeyColumn
 prove-author: Found dist: Util-Medley
 prove-author: Found dist: Backup-Duplicity-YADW
 prove-author: Found dist: Backup-EZ
 prove-author: Found dist: CLI-Driver
 prove-author: Found dist: File-RandomGenerator
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-ORM
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-QueryMulti
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-Util
 prove-author: Found dist: MySQL-Util-Lite-ForeignKeyColumn
 prove-author: Found dist: Util-Medley

 prove-author: [DRY] [7/9] Running prove for distribution MySQL-Util (directory /tmp/IZS7BH1wtI/MySQL-Util-0.41) ...
 prove-author: [DRY] [8/9] Running prove for distribution MySQL-Util-Lite-ForeignKeyColumn (directory /tmp/Cx9Jy7o3_i/MySQL-Util-0.34) ...
 prove-author: [DRY] [9/9] Running prove for distribution Util-Medley (directory /tmp/_DK2_0kdgC/Util-Medley-0.025) ...

The above example shows that I only have the distribution directories locally on
my C<~/repos> for two of GRAVATTJ's distributions.

If we reinvoke the above command without the C<-n>, I<prove-author> will actually
run C<prove> on each directory and provide a summary at the end. Example output:

 % prove-author GRAVATTJ
 +-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

 +-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+

The above example shows that all distributions still failed testing (due to lack
of testing requirements). You can scroll up for the detailed C<prove> output to
see the details of failure failed, fix things, and re-run.

How distribution directory is searched: see L<App::ProveDists> documentation.

When a dependent distribution cannot be found or downloaded/extracted, this
counts as a 412 error (Precondition Failed).

When a distribution's test fails, this counts as a 500 error (Error). Otherwise,
the status is 200 (OK).

I<prove-author> will return status 200 (OK) with the status of each dist. It will
exit 0 if all distros are successful, otherwise it will exit 1.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--author>=I<s>*

CPAN author IDd prove.

=item B<--dists-dir>=I<s@>*

Where to find the distributions directories.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--dists-dirs-json>=I<s>

Where to find the distributions directories (JSON-encoded).

See C<--dists-dir>.

=item B<--no-download>

=item B<--prove-opt>=I<s@>

Options to pass to the prove command.

Default value:

 ["-l"]

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--prove-opts-json>=I<s>

Options to pass to the prove command (JSON-encoded).

See C<--prove-opt>.

=item B<--summarize-all>

If true, also summarize successes in addition to failures.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--dry-run>

Run in simulation mode (also via DRY_RUN=1).

Default value:

 ""

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C prove-author prove-author

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete prove-author 'p/*/`prove-author`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/prove-author.conf>, F<~/prove-author.conf>, or F</etc/prove-author.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

List of available configuration parameters:

 author (see --author)
 dists_dirs (see --dists-dir)
 download (see --no-download)
 format (see --format)
