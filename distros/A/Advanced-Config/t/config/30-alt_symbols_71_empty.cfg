# KEEP THIS TEST AFTER THE TEST IT'S SIMULATING ....
#

# This empty config file is a place holder to repeat the
# tests done by "30-alt_symbols_70 merge multiple files.cfg"
# in an alternate maner.

# The test program is smart enough when it hits this file it will call:
#     $cfg->merge_config ("30-alt_symbols_03.cfg");
#     $cfg->merge_config ("30-alt_symbols_04 multi section test.cfg");
