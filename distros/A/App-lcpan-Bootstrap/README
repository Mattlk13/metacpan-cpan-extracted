NAME
    App::lcpan::Bootstrap - Bootstrap database for lcpan

VERSION
    This document describes version 20200419.0.0 of App::lcpan::Bootstrap
    (from Perl distribution App-lcpan-Bootstrap), released on 2020-04-19.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains the database for lcpan (updated
    periodically), so you can save time when setting up your local CPAN
    mirror the first time. Without a boostrap database, indexing the mirror
    for the first time can take several hours. With a fairly recent
    bootstrap database, indexing time can be reduced to an hour or much
    less.

    The compressed bootstrap database is stored in the distribution's share
    directory. lcpan will search for this bootstrap database the first time
    it is run.

    If you run lcpan before installing this distribution, your empty
    database will already be created. To use the bootstrap database, install
    this distribution, remove the empty created index.db, then run lcpan
    again.
