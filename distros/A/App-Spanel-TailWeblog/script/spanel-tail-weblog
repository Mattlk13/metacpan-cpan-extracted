=head1 NAME

spanel-tail-weblog - Tail -f spanel HTTP and/or HTTPS access log

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of spanel-tail-weblog (from Perl distribution App-Spanel-TailWeblog), released on 2019-01-30.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % spanel-tail-weblog example.com            ; # both http & https
 % spanel-tail-weblog --no-https example.com ; # http only
 % spanel-tail-weblog --no-http  example.com ; # https only

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C spanel-tail-weblog spanel-tail-weblog

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete spanel-tail-weblog 'p/*/`spanel-tail-weblog`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
