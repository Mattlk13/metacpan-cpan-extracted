NAME
    Array::Set::Naive - Like Array::Set, but uses naive algorithms

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Array::Set::Naive (from Perl
    distribution Array-Set-Naive), released on 2021-05-15.

SYNOPSIS
     use Array::Set::Naive qw(set_diff set_symdiff set_union set_intersect);

     set_diff([1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5]);            # => [1]
     set_diff([1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]); # => [1]

     set_symdiff([1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5]);            # => [1,5]
     set_symdiff([1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]); # => [1,6]

     set_union([1,3,2,4], [2,3,4,5]);            # => [1,3,2,4,5]
     set_union([1,3,2,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]); # => [1,3,2,4,5,6]

     set_intersect([1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5]);            # => [2,3,4]
     set_intersect([1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]); # => [3,4]

DESCRIPTION
    This module is like Array::Set, but instead of using hash (Tie::IxHash)
    it performs linear search. This module is mostly for testing only,
    including for testing using List::Keywords (note: this release does not
    use List::Keywords yet due to problem in distro building).
