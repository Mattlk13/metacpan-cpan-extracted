DESCRIPTION

    This script <http://github.com/a3f/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/lsnic>
    packaged as CPAN module. This script reformats lshw -c network -numeric
    output in the tabular format above. If the driver doesn't report a MAC
    address, it's extracted from the serial number read by lspci(1) This
    script requires super user priviliges to work.
