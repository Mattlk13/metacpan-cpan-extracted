NAME
    App::CreateAcmeCPANListsImportModules - Create
    Acme::CPANLists::Import::* modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.07 of
    App::CreateAcmeCPANListsImportModules (from Perl distribution
    App-CreateAcmeCPANListsImportModules), released on 2017-07-08.

FUNCTIONS
  create_acme_cpanlists_import_modules
    Usage:

     create_acme_cpanlists_import_modules(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Create Acme::CPANLists::Import::* modules.

    An "Acme::CPANLists::Import::*" module contains a module list where its
    entries (modules) are extracted from a web page. The purpose of creating
    such module is to have a POD mentioning the modules, thus
    adding/improving to the POD "mentions cloud" on CPAN.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cache => *bool* (default: 1)

    *   dist_dir => *str*

    *   exclude_unindexed => *bool* (default: 1)

        Consult local CPAN index and exclude module entries that are not
        indexed on CPAN.

        This requires "App::lcpan" to be installed and a local CPAN index to
        exist and be fairly recent.

    *   modules* => *array[hash]*

    *   namespace* => *str*

    *   user_agent => *str*

        Set HTTP User-Agent.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  HTTP_USER_AGENT => str
    Set default for "user_agent" argument.
