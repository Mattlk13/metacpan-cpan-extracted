     my $wl = ArrayData::Word::ID::KBBI->new;

     # Iterate the words
     $wl->reset_iterator;
     while ($wl->has_next_item) {
         my $word = $wl->get_next_item;
         ... # do something with the word
     }

     # Another way to iterate
     $wl->each_item(sub { my ($item, $obj, $pos) = @_; ... }); # return false in anonsub to exit early

     # Get words by position (array index)
     my $word = $wl->get_item_at_pos(0);  # get the first word
     my $word = $wl->get_item_at_pos(90); # get the 91th word, will die if there is no word at that position.

     # Get number of words in the list
     my $count = $wl->get_item_count;

     # Get all words from the list
     my @all_words = $wl->get_all_items;

     # Find an item.
     my @found = $wl->find_item(item => 'foo');
     my $has_item = $wl->has_item('foo'); # bool

     # Pick one or several random words.
     my $word = $wl->pick_item;
     my @words = $wl->pick_items(n=>3);
