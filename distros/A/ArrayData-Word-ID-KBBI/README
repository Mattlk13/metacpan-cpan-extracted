SYNOPSIS
     use ArrayData::Word::ID::KBBI;

     my $wl = ArrayData::Word::ID::KBBI->new;

     # Iterate the words
     $wl->reset_iterator;
     while ($wl->has_next_item) {
         my $word = $wl->get_next_item;
         ... # do something about the word
     }

     # Another way to iterate
     $wl->each_item(sub { my ($item, $obj, $pos) = @_; ... }); # return false in anonsub to exit early

     # Get words by position (array index)
     my $word = $wl->get_item_at_pos(0);  # get the first word
     my $word = $wl->get_item_at_pos(90); # get the 91th word, will die if there is no word at that position.

     # Get number of words in the list
     my $count = $wl->get_item_count;

     # Get all words from the list
     my @all_words = $wl->get_all_items;

     # Find an item (by iterating). See Role::TinyCommons::Collection::FindItem for more details.
     my @found = ${wl}->find_item(item => 'foo');
     my $has_item = ${wl}->has_item('foo'); # bool

     # Find an item by binary searching (only when data source is filehandle and the data is sorted)
     Role::Tiny->apply_roles_to_object($wl, 'ArrayData::BinarySearch::LinesInHandle');
     my @found = ${wl}->find_item(item => 'foo');
     my $has_item = ${wl}->has_item('foo'); # bool

     # Pick one or several random words (apply one of these roles first: Role::TinyCommons::Collection::PickItems::{Iterator,RandomSeek})
     Role::Tiny->apply_roles_to_object($wl, 'Role::TinyCommons::Collection::PickItems::Iterator');
     my $word = ${wl}->pick_item;
     my @words = ${wl}->pick_items(n=>3);
