=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<SECURITY WARNING: USE THIS SCRIPT FOR TESTING ONLY AND NOT PRODUCTION.>

This script exports the current directory over anonymous FTP. It chroots to the
directory and switches to the directory owner user (or C<nobody> if directory
owner is root, to avoid running the FTP daemon as root).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The script accepts a single optional argument: the path of the directory to
export.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are available:

=over 4

=item --port PORT

Start the FTP server on a specific C<PORT>. Default is 8021.

=item --help

Print information about the script usage and its options.

=item --man

Print the entire man page for the command.

=back

=head1 TODO

Support systems that do not have chroot().

Support running as normal user (without doing chroot()).

Support non-anonymous (read-write mode).
