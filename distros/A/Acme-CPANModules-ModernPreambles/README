NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ModernPreambles - Modules that offer modern preambles

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ModernPreambles (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ModernPreambles), released on 2019-03-03.

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that offer modern preambles.

    The overwhelming convention for coding Perl properly code is to at least
    add the following preamble:

     use strict;
     use warnings;

    to the beginning of your code. But some people say that's not enough,
    and they develop modules/pragmas that bundle the above incantation plus
    some additional stuffs. For example:

     use Modern::Perl '2018';

    is equivalent to:

     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use feature ':5.26';
     mro::set_mro( scalar caller(), 'c3' );

    I think Modern::Perl is one of the first to popularize this modern
    preamble concept and a bunch of similar preambles emerged. This list
    catalogs them.

    Meanwhile, you can also use:

     use v5.12; # enables strict and warnings, as well as all 5.12 features (see L<feature> for more details on new features of each perl release)

    and so on, but this also means you set a minimum Perl version.
