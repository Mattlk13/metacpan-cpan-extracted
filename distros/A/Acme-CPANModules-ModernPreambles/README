NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ModernPreambles - List of modules that offer modern
    preambles

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ModernPreambles (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ModernPreambles), released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    The overwhelming convention for coding Perl properly code is to at least
    add the following preamble:

     use strict;
     use warnings;

    to the beginning of your code. But some people say that's not enough,
    and they develop modules/pragmas that bundle the above incantation plus
    some additional stuffs. For example:

     use Modern::Perl '2018';

    is equivalent to:

     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use feature ':5.26';
     mro::set_mro( scalar caller(), 'c3' );

    I think Modern::Perl is one of the first to popularize this modern
    preamble concept and a bunch of similar preambles emerged. This list
    catalogs them.

    Meanwhile, you can also use:

     use v5.12; # enables strict and warnings, as well as all 5.12 features (see L<feature> for more details on new features of each perl release)

    and so on, but this also means you set a minimum Perl version.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
