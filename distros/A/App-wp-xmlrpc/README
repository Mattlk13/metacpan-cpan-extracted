SYNOPSIS

    This module is meant to be used only via the included CLI script
    wp-xmlrpc. If you want to make XML-RPC calls to a WordPress website,
    you can use XMLRCCP::Lite directly, e.g. to delete a comment with ID
    13:

     use XMLRPC::Lite;
     my $call = XMLRPC::Lite->proxy("http://example.org/yourblog")->call(
         "wp.deleteComment", # method
         1, # blog ID, usually just set to 1
         "username",
         "password",
         13,
     );
     my $fault = $call->fault;
     if ($fault && $fault->{faultCode}) {
         die "Can't delete comment: $fault->{faultCode} - $fault->{faultString}";
     }

    To find the list of available methods and arguments, see the WordPress
    API reference (see "SEE ALSO").
