=head1 NAME

pause-unpacked - A CLI for PAUSE (unpacked version)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.491 of pause-unpacked (from Perl distribution App-pause-Unpacked), released on 2021-05-26.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use L<pause>:

 % pause upload Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz
 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an unpacked version of L<pause>, for development/testing only. Normal
users should just use L<pause>.

=head1 SUBCOMMANDS

=head2 B<cleanup>

Delete older versions of distributions.

Currently does not look for releases in subdirectories.

By default does not include developer (trial) releases. To include that, use
C<--include-dev>.

To only cleanup developer releases, you can use C<--include-dev> and
C<--exclude-nondev>.


=head2 B<ls>

List files.

=head2 B<ls-dists>

List distributions.

Distribution names will be extracted from tarball/zip filenames.

Unknown/unparseable filenames will be skipped.


=head2 B<ls-mods>

List modules (permissions).

=head2 B<reindex>

Force reindexing.

=head2 B<rm>

Delete files.

When a file is deleted, it is not immediately deleted but has
scheduled_for_deletion status for 72 hours, then deleted. During that time, the
file can be undeleted.


=head2 B<undelete>

Undelete files.

When a file is deleted, it is not immediately deleted but has
scheduled_for_deletion status for 72 hours, then deleted. During that time, the
file can be undeleted.


=head2 B<upload>

Upload file(s).

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Common options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--password>=I<s>

PAUSE password.

If unset, default value will be searched from `~/.pause`. Encrypted `.pause` is
not yet supported.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--retries>=I<s>

Number of retries when received 5xx HTTP error from server.

Default value:

 5

The retry uses an exponential backoff strategy of delaying 3, 6, 12, 24, ...,
3600, 3600, ... seconds.


=item B<--subcommands>

List available subcommands.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=over

=item B<--delay>=I<s>

Pause a number of seconds between files.

If you upload a lot of files (e.g. 7-10 or more) at a time, the PAUSE indexer
currently might choke with SQLite database locking problem and thus fail to
index your releases. Giving a delay of say 2-3 minutes (120-180 seconds) between
files will alleviate this problem.

File name/wildcard pattern.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--files-json>=I<s>

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument and onwards.

Subdirectory to put the file(s) into.

Default value:

 ""

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pause-unpacked pause-unpacked

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pause-unpacked 'p/*/`pause-unpacked`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/pause.conf>, F<~/pause.conf>, or F</etc/pause.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

To put configuration for a certain subcommand only, use a section name like C<[subcommand=NAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=NAME]>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

You can also filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable equals some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable includes some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not include some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

To load and configure plugins, you can use either the C<-plugins> parameter (e.g. C<< -plugins=DumpArgs >> or C<< -plugins=DumpArgs@before_validate_args >>), or use the C<[plugin=NAME ...]> sections, for example:

 [plugin=DumpArgs]
 -event=before_validate_args
 -prio=99
 
 [plugin=Foo]
 -event=after_validate_args
 arg1=val1
 arg2=val2

 

which is equivalent to setting C<< -plugins=-DumpArgs@before_validate_args@99,-Foo@after_validate_args,arg1,val1,arg2,val2 >>.
