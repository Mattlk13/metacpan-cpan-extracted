NAME

  App::japerl - JPerl-again Perl glocalization scripting environment

SYNOPSIS

  $ japerl [switches] [--] script.pl [arguments]

DESCRIPTION

  japerl was created with the intention of succeeding JPerl.
  japerl provides glocalization script environment on both modern Perl
  and traditional Perl by using mb.pm modulino.

  This is often misunderstood, but japerl and jacode.pl have different
  purposes and functions.

       software
  <<elder   younger>>     software purpose
  ----------------------+---------------------------------------
  jcode.pl  jacode.pl   | to convert encoding of data for I/O
  ----------------------+---------------------------------------
  jperl     japerl.bat  | to execute native encoding scripts
                        | (NEVER convert script encoding)
  ----------------------+---------------------------------------

  This software can do the following.
  - choose one perl interpreter in system
  - select local use libraries
  - execute script written in system native encoding

  May you do good magic with japerl.
