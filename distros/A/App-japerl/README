NAME

  App::japerl - JPerl-again Perl glocalization scripting environment

SYNOPSIS

  $ japerl [switches] [--] MBCS_script.pl [arguments]

DESCRIPTION

  japerl.bat is a wrapper for the mb.pm modulino.
  This software assists in the execution of Perl scripts written in MBCS
  encoding.

  It differs in function and purpose from jacode.pl, which has a similar
  name and is often misunderstood. jacode.pl is mainly used to convert
  I/O data encoding.

  On the other hand, mb.pm modulino handles script you wrote, and it
  does not convert its encoding.
