Acme-Evil version 0.003001
==========================

RFC3514 introduces a new flag called the "evil bit" in all IP packets.
The intention is to simplify the work of firewalls. Software that
sends IP packets with malicious intent must set the evil bit to true,
and firewalls can simply drop such packets.

The evil pragma is a Perl implementation of the same concept. With
this pragma malicious modules can declare their evil intent while
critical modules can request that they will only use / run alongside
non-evil code.
