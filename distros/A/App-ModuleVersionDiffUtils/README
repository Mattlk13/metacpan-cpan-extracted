NAME
    App::ModuleVersionDiffUtils - Utilities to diff stuffs from two
    different versions of a module

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of App::ModuleVersionDiffUtils
    (from Perl distribution App-ModuleVersionDiffUtils), released on
    2021-05-25.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities:

    *   diff-two-module-version-hash

FUNCTIONS
  diff_two_module_version_hash
    Usage:

     diff_two_module_version_hash(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Examples:

    *   Diff %hash between two versions of Foo::Bar:

         diff_two_module_version_hash( module => "Foo::Bar", hash_name => "%hash");

    *   Diff $hashref between two versions of Foo::Bar:

         diff_two_module_version_hash( module => "Foo::Bar", hash_name => "\$hashref");

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   hash_name* => *str*

        Hash name to be found in module namespace, with sigil.

    *   include_dir => *array[dirname]*

    *   module* => *perl::modname*

        Module will be searched in the @INC (you can specify "-I" to add
        more directories to search). There needs to be at least two
        locations of the module. Otherwise, the application will croak.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP status code
    (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
    ($reason) is a string containing error message, or "OK" if status is
    200. Third element ($payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
    element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
    that contains extra information.

    Return value: (any)
