=head1 NAME

docmake - a tool to render DocBook/XML into various output formats.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0405

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # To render input.xml file into XHTML
    docmake -o output.xhtml xhtml input.xml

    # Same with more verbose output
    docmake -v -o output.xhtml xhtml input.xml

    # Render into pdf
    docmake -v -o output.pdf pdf input.xml

    # Same while not rebuilding if not necessary
    docmake -v --make -o output.pdf pdf input.xml

    # Render using a Stylesheet
    docmake -v -o output.xhtml -x my-stylesheets.xsl xhtml input.xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<docmake> is a tool to render DocBook/XML into its resultant formats
using XSLT: XHTML, XSL-FO, PDF, RTF, etc. For a brief help type
C<docmake help> .

It aims to be a replacement for xmlto -
L<http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/xmlto/> . As opposed to xmlto,
it is written in Perl, which is easier to get right than xmlto's Bash, and
xmlto hasn't been updated for a long time when I started work on docmake.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0405

=head1 USAGE

The basic invocation of docmake is:

    docmake [flags] MODE input.xml

=head2 MODES

The available modes are:

=over 4

=over 4

=item * -h ; --help

=item * -v ; --verbose

=item * -o OUTPUT_PATH

=item * -x STYLESHEET ; --stylesheet STYLESHEET

Use the XSLT stylesheet B<STYLESHEET> for performing XSLT transformations.

=item * --basepath PATH

This is the base path for the DocBook stylesheets. The appropriate XSLT mode
will be appended to it. This is for example, useful for building DocBook 5
documents by specifying the path to their stylesheets.

=item * --stringparam KEY=VALUE

Specify the string parameter of B<KEY> as B<VALUE>. Note that as opposed to
xsltproc, B<KEY> and B<VALUE> cannot be specified as different command line
arguments, but rather should be on the same one, delimited by an equal sign ("C<=>").
