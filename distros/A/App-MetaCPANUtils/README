VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of App::MetaCPANUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-MetaCPANUtils), released on 2023-01-15.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains CLI utilities related to MetaCPAN:

    *   diff-metacpan-releases

    *   download-metacpan-release

    *   list-metacpan-distribution-versions

    *   list-metacpan-distributions

    *   list-metacpan-releases

    *   list-recent-metacpan-releases

    *   open-metacpan-dist-page

    *   open-metacpan-module-page

FUNCTIONS
  diff_metacpan_releases
    Usage:

     diff_metacpan_releases(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Diff two release tarballs.

    Examples:

    *   What changed between App-orgadb 0.014 and 0.015?:

         diff_metacpan_releases(distribution => "App-orgadb", version1 => 0.014, version2 => 0.015);

    *   What changed in the latest version of App-orgadb?:

         diff_metacpan_releases(
             distribution => "App-orgadb",
           version1     => "latest-1",
           version2     => "latest"
         );

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   distribution* => *perl::distname*

        (No description)

    *   version1* => *perl::module::release::version*

        (No description)

    *   version2* => *perl::module::release::version*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  download_metacpan_release
    Usage:

     download_metacpan_release(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Download a release to the current directory.

    Examples:

    *   Download latest release of App-orgadb distribution:

         download_metacpan_release(distribution => "App-orgadb");

    *   Download the second latest release of App-orgadb distribution:

         download_metacpan_release(distribution => "App-orgadb", version => "latest-1");

    Uses HTTP::Tiny::Plugin so you can customize download behavior using
    e.g. "HTTP_TINY_PLUGINS" environment variable.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
