=head1 NAME

bloomcalc - Shorter alias for bloom-filter-calculator

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.007 of bloomcalc (from Perl distribution App-BloomUtils), released on 2020-05-24.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % bloomcalc [--debug] [--false-positive-rate=s] [--format=name]
     [--fp-rate=s] [--json] [-k=s] [--log-level=level] [-m=s]
     [--(no)naked-res] [--num-bits=s]
     [--num-hashes-to-bits-per-item-ratio=s] [--num-hashes=s] [-p=s]
     [--page-result[=program]] [--quiet] [--trace] [--verbose] <num_items>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You supply lines of text from STDIN and it will output the bloom filter bits on
STDOUT. You can also customize C<num_bits> (C<m>) and C<num_hashes> (C<k>), or, more
easily, C<num_items> and C<fp_rate>. Some rules of thumb to remember:

=over

=item * One byte per item in the input set gives about a 2% false positive rate. So if
you expect two have 1024 elements, create a 1KB bloom filter with about 2%
false positive rate. For other false positive rates:

10%    -  4.8 bits per item
 1%    -  9.6 bits per item
 0.1%  - 14.4 bits per item
 0.01% - 19.2 bits per item

=item * Optimal number of hash functions is 0.7 times number of bits per item. Note
that the number of hashes dominate performance. If you want higher
performance, pick a smaller number of hashes. But for most cases, use the the
optimal number of hash functions.

=item * What is an acceptable false positive rate? This depends on your needs. 1% (1
in 100) or 0.1% (1 in 1,000) is a good start. If you want to make sure that
user's chosen password is not in a known wordlist, a higher false positive
rates will annoy your user more by rejecting her password more often, while
lower false positive rates will require a higher memory usage.

B<FAQ>

=over

=item * Why does two different false positive rates (e.g. 1% and 0.1%) give the same bloom filter size?

The parameter C<m> is rounded upwards to the nearest power of 2 (e.g. 1024*8
bits becomes 1024*8 bits but 1025*8 becomes 2048*8 bits), so sometimes two
false positive rates with different C<m> get rounded to the same value of C<m>.
Use the C<bloom_filter_calculator> routine to see the C<actual_m> and C<actual_p>
(actual false-positive rate).

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--false-positive-rate>=I<s>, B<-p>, B<--fp-rate>

Default value:

 0.02

=item B<--num-bits>=I<s>, B<-m>

Number of bits to set for the bloom filter.

=item B<--num-hashes-to-bits-per-item-ratio>=I<s>

0.7 (the default) is optimal.

=item B<--num-hashes>=I<s>, B<-k>

=item B<--num-items>=I<s>*, B<-n>

Expected number of items to add to bloom filter.

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C bloomcalc bloomcalc

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete bloomcalc 'p/*/`bloomcalc`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
