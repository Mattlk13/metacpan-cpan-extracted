=head1 NAME

gen-bloom-filter - Generate bloom filter

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of gen-bloom-filter (from Perl distribution App-BloomUtils), released on 2018-03-23.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % gen-bloom-filter [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You supply lines of text from STDIN and it will output the bloom filter bits on
STDOUT. You can also customize C<num_bits> (C<m>) and C<num_hashes> (C<k>). Some
rules of thumb to remember:

=over

=item * One byte per item in the input set gives about a 2% false positive rate. So if
you expect two have 1024 elements, create a 1KB bloom filter with about 2%
false positive rate. For other false positive rates:

1%    -  9.6 bits per item
0.1%  - 14.4 bits per item
0.01% - 19.2 bits per item

=item * Optimal number of hash functions is 0.7 times number of bits per item.

=item * What is an acceptable false positive rate? This depends on your needs.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--num-bits>=I<s>, B<-m>

Default value:

 80000

The default is 80000 (generates a ~10KB bloom filter). If you supply 10,000 items
(meaning 1 byte per 1 item) then the false positive rate will be ~2%. If you
supply fewer items the false positive rate is smaller and if you supply more
than 10,000 items the false positive rate will be higher.


=item B<--num-hashes>=I<s>, B<-k>

Default value:

 5.7

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C gen-bloom-filter gen-bloom-filter

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete gen-bloom-filter 'p/*/`gen-bloom-filter`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
