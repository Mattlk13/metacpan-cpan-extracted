NAME
    App::Filite::Client - client library for Filite servers

SYNOPSIS
      my $client = App::Filite::Client->new_from_config;
      my $url = $client->share( 'path/to/file.txt' );
      print "Shared to $url\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Share a file, chunk of text, or link via a Filite server.

    Filite is a URL shortner, file sharer, and pastebin that you can
    self-host.

  Config File
    Configuration is via a JSON-formatted file usually named
    ~/.config/filite-client/config.json (see also File::XDG), though this can
    be overridden using the `FILITE_CLIENT_CONFIG` environment variable.

  Constructors
    `new( %attrs )`
        Moose-like constructor.

    `new_from_config()`
        Load %attrs from the config instead of as parameters.

  Attributes
    All attributes are read-write.

    `server` Str
        The filite server to share things via. This will typically be a URL
        like "https://example.com/" or "http://example.net:8080".

    `password` Str
        Filite is a single user system so has a password but no username.

    `useragent` Object
        Can be set to a custom HTTP::Tiny instance. Cannot be specified in the
        config file.

    `errors` Int
        The number of errors which have been seen so far. It makes little
        sense to set this in the constructor or config file.

  Methods
    `share( $filename, \%opts )`
        Accepts `text`, `file`, `link`, and `highlight` options. All of these
        options are booleans.

        $filename may be "-" to read from STDIN.

    `share_text( $filename, \%opts )`
        Accepts a `highlight` option, which is a boolean.

        $filename may be "-" to read from STDIN.

    `share_file( $filename, \%opts )`
        The options are ignored.

        $filename may be "-" to read from STDIN.

    `share_link( $url, \%opts )`
        The options are ignored.

        $url may be "-" to read a URL from STDIN.

    `execute( \@argv )`
        Reads options and input filenames/URLs from @argv, like processing a
        command-line. If @argv isn't given, then uses the global @ARGV.
