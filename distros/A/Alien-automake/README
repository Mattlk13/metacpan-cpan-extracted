NAME

    Alien::automake - Build or find automake

VERSION

    version 0.14

SYNOPSIS

    In your script or module:

     use Alien::automake;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::automake->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides automake so that it can be used by other
    Perl distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to
    detect an existing install of automake on your system. If found it will
    use that. If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded
    from the internet and it will be installed in a private share location
    for the use of other modules.

CAVEATS

    This module is currently configured to always do a share install. This
    is because system installs for this alien are not reliable. Please see
    this issue for details:
    https://github.com/plicease/Alien-autoconf/issues/2 (the issue is for
    autoconf, but relates to automake as well). The good news is that most
    of the time you shouldn't need this module unless you are building
    another alien from source. If your system provides the package that is
    targeted by the upstream alien I recommend using that. If you are
    packaging system packages for your platform then I recommend making
    sure the upstream alien uses the system library so you won't need to
    install this module.
