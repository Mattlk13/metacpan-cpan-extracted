DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: THE API IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE STABLE UNTIL VERSION 1.0.

    This module aims to implement the W3C WebDriver specification which is
    the standardised equivalent to the Selenium WebDriver API., which in
    turn aims at remotely controlling web browsers such as Firefox or
    Chromium.

    At the time of this writing, it was so brand new that I could only get
    "geckodriver" (For Firefox) to work, but that is expected to be fixed
    very soon indeed.

    To make most of this module, or, in fact, to make any reasonable use of
    this module, you would need to refer to the W3C WebDriver
    recommendation, which can be found here
    <https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/>:

       https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/

  CONVENTIONS
    Unless otherwise stated, all delays and time differences in this module
    are represented as an integer number of milliseconds.

  WEBDRIVER OBJECTS
    new AnyEvent::WebDriver key => value...
        Create a new WebDriver object. Example for a remote WebDriver
        connection (the only type supported at the moment):

           my $wd = new AnyEvent::WebDriver host => "localhost", port => 4444;

        Supported keys are:

        endpoint => $string
            For remote connections, the endpoint to connect to (defaults to
            "http://localhost:4444").

        proxy => $proxyspec
            The proxy to use (same as the "proxy" argument used by
            AnyEvent::HTTP). The default is "undef", which disables proxies.
            To use the system-provided proxy (e.g. "http_proxy" environment
            variable), specify a value of "default".

        autodelete => $boolean
            If true (the default), then automatically execute
            "delete_session" when the WebDriver object is destroyed with an
            active session. IF set to a false value, then the session will
            continue to exist.

        timeout => $seconds
            The HTTP timeout, in (fractional) seconds (default: 300, but
            this will likely drastically reduce). This timeout is reset on
            any activity, so it is not an overall request timeout. Also,
            individual requests might extend this timeout if they are known
            to take longer.

        persistent => 1 | "undef"
            If true (the default) then persistent connections will be used
            for all requests, which assumes you have a reasonably stable
            connection (such as to "localhost" :) and that the WebDriver has
            a persistent timeout much higher than what AnyEvent::HTTP uses.

            You can force connections to be closed for non-idempotent
            requests by setting this to "undef".

    $al = $wd->actions
        Creates an action list associated with this WebDriver. See ACTION
        LISTS, below, for full details.

    $sessionstring = $wd->save_session
        Save the current session in a string so it can be restored load with
        "load_session". Note that only the session data itself is stored
        (currently the session id and capabilities), not the endpoint
        information itself.

        The main use of this function is in conjunction with disabled
        "autodelete", to save a session to e.g., and restore it later. It
        could presumably used for other applications, such as using the same
        session from multiple processes and so on.

    $wd->load_session ($sessionstring)
    $wd->set_session ($sessionid, $capabilities)
        Starts using the given session, as identified by $sessionid.
        $capabilities should be the original session capabilities, although
        the current version of this module does not make any use of it.

        The $sessionid is stored in "$wd->{sid}" (and could be fetched form
        there for later use), while the capabilities are stored in
        "$wd->{capabilities}".

  SIMPLIFIED API
    This section documents the simplified API, which is really just a very
    thin wrapper around the WebDriver protocol commands. They all block
    (using AnyEvent condvars) the caller until the result is available, so
    must not be called from an event loop callback - see "EVENT BASED API"
    for an alternative.

    The method names are pretty much taken directly from the W3C WebDriver
    specification, e.g. the request documented in the "Get All Cookies"
    section is implemented via the "get_all_cookies" method.

    The order is the same as in the WebDriver draft at the time of this
    writing, and only minimal massaging is done to request parameters and
    results.

   SESSIONS
    $wd->new_session ({ key => value... })
        Try to connect to the WebDriver and initialize a new session with a
        "new session" command, passing the given key-value pairs as value
        (e.g. "capabilities").

        No session-dependent methods must be called before this function
        returns successfully, and only one session can be created per
        WebDriver object.

        On success, "$wd->{sid}" is set to the session ID, and
        "$wd->{capabilities}" is set to the returned capabilities.

        Simple example of creating a WebDriver object and a new session:

           my $wd = new AnyEvent::Selenium endpoint => "http://localhost:4545";
           $wd->new_session ({});

        Real-world example with capability negotiation:

           $wd->new_session ({
              capabilities => {
                 alwaysMatch => {
                    pageLoadStrategy        => "eager",
                    unhandledPromptBehavior => "dismiss",
                    # proxy => { proxyType => "manual", httpProxy => "1.2.3.4:56", sslProxy => "1.2.3.4:56" },
                 },
                 firstMatch => [
                    {
                       browserName => "firefox",
                       "moz:firefoxOptions" => {
                          binary => "firefox/firefox",
                          args => ["-devtools"],
                          prefs => {
                             "dom.webnotifications.enabled" => \0,
                             "dom.push.enabled" => \0,
                             "dom.disable_beforeunload" => \1,
                             "browser.link.open_newwindow" => 3,
                             "browser.link.open_newwindow.restrictions" => 0,
                             "dom.popup_allowed_events" => "",
                             "dom.disable_open_during_load" => \1,
                          },
                       },
                    },
                    {
                       # generic fallback
                    },
                 ],

              },
           });

        Firefox-specific capability documentation can be found on MDN
        <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities
        >, Chrome-specific capability documentation might be found here
        <http://chromedriver.chromium.org/capabilities>, but the latest
        release at the time of this writing has effectively no WebDriver
        support at all, and canary releases are not freely downloadable.

        If you have URLs for Safari/IE/Edge etc. capabilities, feel free to
        tell me about them.

    $wd->delete_session
        Deletes the session - the WebDriver object must not be used after
        this call.

    $timeouts = $wd->get_timeouts
        Get the current timeouts, e.g.:

           my $timeouts = $wd->get_timeouts;
           => { implicit => 0, pageLoad => 300000, script => 30000 }

    $wd->set_timeouts ($timeouts)
        Sets one or more timeouts, e.g.:

           $wd->set_timeouts ({ script => 60000 });

   NAVIGATION
    $wd->navigate_to ($url)
        Navigates to the specified URL.

    $url = $wd->get_current_url
        Queries the current page URL as set by "navigate_to".

    $wd->back
        The equivalent of pressing "back" in the browser.

    $wd->forward
        The equivalent of pressing "forward" in the browser.

    $wd->refresh
        The equivalent of pressing "refresh" in the browser.

    $title = $wd->get_title
        Returns the current document title.

   COMMAND CONTEXTS
    $handle = $wd->get_window_handle
        Returns the current window handle.

    $wd->close_window
        Closes the current browsing context.

    $wd->switch_to_window ($handle)
        Changes the current browsing context to the given window.

    $handles = $wd->get_window_handles
        Return the current window handles as an array-ref of handle IDs.

    $handles = $wd->switch_to_frame ($frame)
        Switch to the given frame identified by $frame, which must be either
        "undef" to go back to the top-level browsing context, an integer to
        select the nth subframe, or an element object.

    $handles = $wd->switch_to_parent_frame
        Switch to the parent frame.

    $rect = $wd->get_window_rect
        Return the current window rect(angle), e.g.:

           $rect = $wd->get_window_rect
           => { height => 1040, width => 540, x => 0, y => 0 }

    $wd->set_window_rect ($rect)
        Sets the window rect(angle).

    $wd->maximize_window
    $wd->minimize_window
    $wd->fullscreen_window
        Changes the window size by either maximising, minimising or making
        it fullscreen. In my experience, this will timeout if no window
        manager is running.

   ELEMENT RETRIEVAL
    To reduce typing and memory strain, the element finding functions accept
    some shorter and hopefully easier to remember aliases for the standard
    locator strategy values, as follows:

       Alias   Locator Strategy
       css     css selector
       link    link text
       substr  partial link text
       tag     tag name

    $element = $wd->find_element ($locator_strategy, $selector)
        Finds the first element specified by the given selector and returns
        its element object. Raises an error when no element was found.

        Examples showing all standard locator strategies:

           $element = $wd->find_element ("css selector" => "body a");
           $element = $wd->find_element ("link text" => "Click Here For Porn");
           $element = $wd->find_element ("partial link text" => "orn");
           $element = $wd->find_element ("tag name" => "input");
           $element = $wd->find_element ("xpath" => '//input[@type="text"]');
           => e.g. { "element-6066-11e4-a52e-4f735466cecf" => "decddca8-5986-4e1d-8c93-efe952505a5f" }

        Same examples using aliases provided by this module:

           $element = $wd->find_element (css => "body a");
           $element = $wd->find_element (link => "Click Here For Porn");
           $element = $wd->find_element (substr => "orn");
           $element = $wd->find_element (tag => "input");

    $elements = $wd->find_elements ($locator_strategy, $selector)
        As above, but returns an arrayref of all found element objects.

    $element = $wd->find_element_from_element ($element, $locator_strategy,
    $selector)
        Like "find_element", but looks only inside the specified $element.

    $elements = $wd->find_elements_from_element ($element,
    $locator_strategy, $selector)
        Like "find_elements", but looks only inside the specified $element.

           my $head = $wd->find_element ("tag name" => "head");
           my $links = $wd->find_elements_from_element ($head, "tag name", "link");

    $element = $wd->get_active_element
        Returns the active element.

   ELEMENT STATE
    $bool = $wd->is_element_selected
        Returns whether the given input or option element is selected or
        not.

    $string = $wd->get_element_attribute ($element, $name)
        Returns the value of the given attribute.

    $string = $wd->get_element_property ($element, $name)
        Returns the value of the given property.

    $string = $wd->get_element_css_value ($element, $name)
        Returns the value of the given CSS value.

    $string = $wd->get_element_text ($element)
        Returns the (rendered) text content of the given element.

    $string = $wd->get_element_tag_name ($element)
        Returns the tag of the given element.

    $rect = $wd->get_element_rect ($element)
        Returns the element rect(angle) of the given element.

    $bool = $wd->is_element_enabled
        Returns whether the element is enabled or not.

   ELEMENT INTERACTION
    $wd->element_click ($element)
        Clicks the given element.

    $wd->element_clear ($element)
        Clear the contents of the given element.

    $wd->element_send_keys ($element, $text)
        Sends the given text as key events to the given element.

   DOCUMENT HANDLING
    $source = $wd->get_page_source
        Returns the (HTML/XML) page source of the current document.

    $results = $wd->execute_script ($javascript, $args)
        Synchronously execute the given script with given arguments and
        return its results ($args can be "undef" if no arguments are
        wanted/needed).

           $ten = $wd->execute_script ("return arguments[0]+arguments[1]", [3, 7]);

    $results = $wd->execute_async_script ($javascript, $args)
        Similar to "execute_script", but doesn't wait for script to return,
        but instead waits for the script to call its last argument, which is
        added to $args automatically.

          $twenty = $wd->execute_async_script ("arguments[0](20)", undef);

   COOKIES
    $cookies = $wd->get_all_cookies
        Returns all cookies, as an arrayref of hashrefs.

           # google surely sets a lot of cookies without my consent
           $wd->navigate_to ("http://google.com");
           use Data::Dump;
           ddx $wd->get_all_cookies;

    $cookie = $wd->get_named_cookie ($name)
        Returns a single cookie as a hashref.

    $wd->add_cookie ($cookie)
        Adds the given cookie hashref.

    $wd->delete_cookie ($name)
        Delete the named cookie.

    $wd->delete_all_cookies
        Delete all cookies.

   ACTIONS
    $wd->perform_actions ($actions)
        Perform the given actions (an arrayref of action specifications
        simulating user activity, or an "AnyEvent::WebDriver::Actions"
        object). For further details, read the spec or the section "ACTION
        LISTS", below.

        An example to get you started (see the next example for a mostly
        equivalent example using the "AnyEvent::WebDriver::Actions" helper
        API):

           $wd->navigate_to ("https://duckduckgo.com/html");
           my $input = $wd->find_element ("css selector", 'input[type="text"]');
           $wd->perform_actions ([
              {
                 id => "myfatfinger",
                 type => "pointer",
                 pointerType => "touch",
                 actions => [
                    { type => "pointerMove", duration => 100, origin => $input, x => 40, y => 5 },
                    { type => "pointerDown", button => 1 },
                    { type => "pause", duration => 40 },
                    { type => "pointerUp", button => 1 },
                 ],
              },
              {
                 id => "mykeyboard",
                 type => "key",
                 actions => [
                    { type => "pause" },
                    { type => "pause" },
                    { type => "pause" },
                    { type => "pause" },
                    { type => "keyDown", value => "a" },
                    { type => "pause", duration => 100 },
                    { type => "keyUp", value => "a" },
                    { type => "pause", duration => 100 },
                    { type => "keyDown", value => "b" },
                    { type => "pause", duration => 100 },
                    { type => "keyUp", value => "b" },
                    { type => "pause", duration => 2000 },
                    { type => "keyDown", value => "\x{E007}" }, # enter
                    { type => "pause", duration => 100 },
                    { type => "keyUp", value => "\x{E007}" }, # enter
                    { type => "pause", duration => 5000 },
                 ],
              },
           ]);

        And here is essentially the same (except for fewer pauses) example
        as above, using the much simpler "AnyEvent::WebDriver::Actions" API.
        Note that the pointer up and key down event happen concurrently in
        this example:

           $wd->navigate_to ("https://duckduckgo.com/html");
           my $input = $wd->find_element ("css selector", 'input[type="text"]');
           $wd->actions
              ->move ($input, 40, 5, "touch1")
              ->click
              ->key ("a")
              ->key ("b")
              ->pause (2000)
              ->key ("\x{E007}")
              ->pause (5000)
              ->perform;

    $wd->release_actions
        Release all keys and pointer buttons currently depressed.

   USER PROMPTS
    $wd->dismiss_alert
        Dismiss a simple dialog, if present.

    $wd->accept_alert
        Accept a simple dialog, if present.

    $text = $wd->get_alert_text
        Returns the text of any simple dialog.

    $text = $wd->send_alert_text
        Fills in the user prompt with the given text.

   SCREEN CAPTURE
    $wd->take_screenshot
        Create a screenshot, returning it as a PNG image in a "data:" URL.

    $wd->take_element_screenshot ($element)
        Accept a simple dialog, if present.

  ACTION LISTS
    Action lists can be quite complicated. Or at least it took a while for
    me to twist my head around them. Basically, an action list consists of a
    number of sources representing devices (such as a finger, a mouse, a pen
    or a keyboard) and a list of actions for each source.

    An action can be a key press, a pointer move or a pause (time delay).
    Actions from different sources can happen "at the same time", while
    actions from a single source are executed in order.

    While you can provide an action list manually, it is (hopefully) less
    cumbersome to use the API described in this section to create them.

    The basic process of creating and performing actions is to create a new
    action list, adding action sources, followed by adding actions. Finally
    you would "perform" those actions on the WebDriver.

    Virtual time progresses as long as you add actions to the same event
    source. Adding events to different sources are considered to happen
    concurrently. If you want to force time to progress, you can do this
    using a call to "->pause (0)".

    Most methods here are designed to chain, i.e. they return the web
    actions object, to simplify multiple calls.

    For example, to simulate a mouse click to an input element, followed by
    entering some text and pressing enter, you can use this:

       $wd->actions
          ->click (1, 100)
          ->type ("some text")
          ->key ("{Enter}")
          ->perform;

    By default, keyboard and mouse input sources are provided. You can
    create your own sources and use them when adding events. The above
    example could be more verbosely written like this:

       $wd->actions
          ->source ("mouse", "pointer", pointerType => "mouse")
          ->source ("kbd", "key")
          ->click (1, 100, "mouse")
          ->type ("some text", "kbd")
          ->key ("{Enter}", "kbd")
          ->perform;

    When you specify the event source explicitly it will switch the current
    "focus" for this class of device (all keyboards are in one class, all
    pointer-like devices such as mice/fingers/pens are in one class), so you
    don't have to specify the source for subsequent actions.

    When you use the sources "keyboard", "mouse", "touch1".."touch3", "pen"
    without defining them, then a suitable default source will be created
    for them.

    $al = new AnyEvent::WebDriver::Actions
        Create a new empty action list object. More often you would use the
        "$wd->action_list" method to create one that is already associated
        with a given web driver.

    $al = $al->source ($id, $type, key => value...)
        The first time you call this with a given ID, this defines the event
        source using the extra parameters. Subsequent calls merely switch
        the current source for its event class.

        It's not an error to define built-in sources (such as "keyboard" or
        "touch1") differently then the defaults.

        Example: define a new touch device called "fatfinger".

           $al->source (fatfinger => "pointer", pointerType => "touch");

        Example: define a new touch device called "fatfinger".

           $al->source (fatfinger => "pointer", pointerType => "touch");

        Example: switch default keyboard source to "kbd1", assuming it is of
        "key" class.

           $al->source ("kbd1");

    $al = $al->pause ($duration)
        Creates a pause with the given duration. Makes sure that time
        progresses in any case, even when $duration is 0.

    $al = $al->pointer_down ($button, $source)
    $al = $al->pointer_up ($button, $source)
        Press or release the given button. $button defaults to 1.

    $al = $al->click ($button, $source)
        Convenience function that creates a button press and release action
        without any delay between them. $button defaults to 1.

    $al = $al->doubleclick ($button, $source)
        Convenience function that creates two button press and release
        action pairs in a row, with no unnecessary delay between them.
        $button defaults to 1.

    $al = $al->move ($button, $origin, $x, $y, $duration, $source)
        Moves a pointer to the given position, relative to origin (either
        "viewport", "pointer" or an element object.

    $al = $al->keyDown ($key, $source)
    $al = $al->keyUp ($key, $source)
        Press or release the given key.

    $al = $al->key ($key, $source)
        Peess and release the given key, without unnecessary delay.

        A special syntax, "{keyname}" can be used for special keys - all the
        special key names from section 17.4.2
        <https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#keyboard-actions> of the
        WebDriver recommendation can be used.

        Example: press and release "a".

           $al->key ("a");

        Example: press and release the "Enter" key:

           $al->key ("\x{e007}");

        Example: press and release the "enter" key using the special key
        name syntax:

           $al->key ("{Enter}");

    $al = $al->type ($string, $source)
        Convenience method to simulate a series of key press and release
        events for the keys in $string. There is no syntax for special keys,
        everything will be typed "as-is" if possible.

    $al->perform ($wd)
        Finalises and compiles the list, if not done yet, and calls
        "$wd->perform" with it.

        If $wd is undef, and the action list was created using the
        "$wd->actions" method, then perform it against that WebDriver
        object.

        There is no underscore variant - call the "perform_actions_" method
        with the action object instead.

    $al->perform_release ($wd)
        Exactly like "perform", but additionally call "release_actions"
        afterwards.

    ($actions, $duration) = $al->compile
        Finalises and compiles the list, if not done yet, and returns an
        actions object suitable for calls to "$wd->perform_actions". When
        called in list context, additionally returns the total duration of
        the action list.

        Since building large action lists can take nontrivial amounts of
        time, it can make sense to build an action list only once and then
        perform it multiple times.

        Actions must not be added after compiling a list.

  EVENT BASED API
    This module wouldn't be a good AnyEvent citizen if it didn't have a true
    event-based API.

    In fact, the simplified API, as documented above, is emulated via the
    event-based API and an "AUTOLOAD" function that automatically provides
    blocking wrappers around the callback-based API.

    Every method documented in the "SIMPLIFIED API" section has an
    equivalent event-based method that is formed by appending a underscore
    ("_") to the method name, and appending a callback to the argument list
    (mnemonic: the underscore indicates the "the action is not yet finished"
    after the call returns).

    For example, instead of a blocking calls to "new_session", "navigate_to"
    and "back", you can make a callback-based ones:

       my $cv = AE::cv;

       $wd->new_session ({}, sub {
          my ($status, $value) = @_,

          die "error $value->{error}" if $status ne "200";

          $wd->navigate_to_ ("http://www.nethype.de", sub {

             $wd->back_ (sub {
                print "all done\n";
                $cv->send;
             });

          });
       });

       $cv->recv;

    While the blocking methods "croak" on errors, the callback-based ones
    all pass two values to the callback, $status and $res, where $status is
    the HTTP status code (200 for successful requests, typically 4xx or 5xx
    for errors), and $res is the value of the "value" key in the JSON
    response object.

    Other than that, the underscore variants and the blocking variants are
    identical.

  LOW LEVEL API
    All the simplified API methods are very thin wrappers around WebDriver
    commands of the same name. They are all implemented in terms of the
    low-level methods ("req", "get", "post" and "delete"), which exists in
    blocking and callback-based variants ("req_", "get_", "post_" and
    "delete_").

    Examples are after the function descriptions.

    $wd->req_ ($method, $uri, $body, $cb->($status, $value))
    $value = $wd->req ($method, $uri, $body)
        Appends the $uri to the "endpoint/session/{sessionid}/" URL and
        makes a HTTP $method request ("GET", "POST" etc.). "POST" requests
        can provide a UTF-8-encoded JSON text as HTTP request body, or the
        empty string to indicate no body is used.

        For the callback version, the callback gets passed the HTTP status
        code (200 for every successful request), and the value of the
        "value" key in the JSON response object as second argument.

    $wd->get_ ($uri, $cb->($status, $value))
    $value = $wd->get ($uri)
        Simply a call to "req_" with $method set to "GET" and an empty body.

    $wd->post_ ($uri, $data, $cb->($status, $value))
    $value = $wd->post ($uri, $data)
        Simply a call to "req_" with $method set to "POST" - if $body is
        "undef", then an empty object is send, otherwise, $data must be a
        valid request object, which gets encoded into JSON for you.

    $wd->delete_ ($uri, $cb->($status, $value))
    $value = $wd->delete ($uri)
        Simply a call to "req_" with $method set to "DELETE" and an empty
        body.

    Example: implement "get_all_cookies", which is a simple "GET" request
    without any parameters:

       $cookies = $wd->get ("cookie");

    Example: implement "execute_script", which needs some parameters:

       $results = $wd->post ("execute/sync" => { script => "$javascript", args => [] });

    Example: call "find_elements" to find all "IMG" elements:

       $elems = $wd->post (elements => { using => "css selector", value => "img" });

HISTORY
    This module was unintentionally created (it started inside some quickly
    hacked-together script) simply because I couldn't get the existing
    "Selenium::Remote::Driver" module to work, ever, despite multiple
    attempts over the years and trying to report multiple bugs, which have
    been completely ignored. It's also not event-based, so, yeah...
