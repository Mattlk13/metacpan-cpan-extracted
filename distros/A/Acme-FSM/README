OVERVIEW

  Acme::FSM implements something resembling Finite State Machine.  If
  you're looking for rigor then look somewhere else.  If you're looking
  for feature set then keep looking.

  What A::F does is mechanics with zero awarness of inputs and/or
  outputs (any or both might be missing).  Implementation is definetely
  crude.  That stems from historical burden -- it's a fork!

  If you're not demotivated yet then Acme::FSM has more.

  Test-suite scores 1083 units.

INSTALL

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

  A::F doesn't need anything (even core modules).  However,

  perl
      *v5.10*, but that's not verified yet.

  version
      *v0.77*.  That's definetely contradicts perl.  I haven't dug
      through Changes yet, can't say when The Core has switched to
      *v0.77* though.

  "Carp"
      Whatever comes with perl, hopefully.

  Module::Build
      Whatever comes with perl.  Cut off version to be determined yet.
