# Contributing to News

If you have suggestions for the documentation of News itself, or
changes to suggest, feel free to contact me by mail:
[alex@gnu.org](mailto:alex@gnu.org) or take a look at the
[alternatives](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact).

As for code contributions, I prefer people sending me a link to their
feature branches on a public git repository, but [patches via
email](https://git-send-email.io/) work as well.

## Commit messages

Use the [packaging] tag to indicate changes that package maintainers
must know about.
