1.02

- No user-visible changes. All changes are CPAN related.

1.01

- Instead of using localhost, rely on Net::NNTP to figure it out: it
  uses the environment variable NNTPSERVER, for example.

- Message-id for the intro must come from an environment variable.

- Do away with the group filter since lynx and the like also don't
  filter.

- Systemd service example.

1.00

- Initial release.
