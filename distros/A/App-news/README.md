# News

This is a web app that contacts the local news server via NNTP and
shows a forum user interface.

This web app provides no filtering, no scoring, no pagination (!) â€“
the use-case it currently serves is as an introduction to the news
system itself. Users are expected to get accounts and use a NNTP
client such as `tin`, `slrn`, `nn`, `knews` or Thunderbird.
