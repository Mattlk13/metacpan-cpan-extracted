# News

This is a web app that contacts a news server via NNTP and shows a
forum user interface.

This web app provides no filtering, no scoring â€“ the use-case it
currently serves is as an introduction to the news system itself.
Users are expected to get accounts and use a NNTP client such as
`tin`, `slrn`, `nn`, `knews` or Thunderbird.

You can install App::news via CPAN.
