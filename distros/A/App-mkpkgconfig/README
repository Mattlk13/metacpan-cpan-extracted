mkpkgconfig

mkpkgconfig creates a pkg-config metadata (".pc") file. pkg-config
variables and keywords are defined on the command line, variable
dependencies are validated, and the configuration file is output.
"Standard" variables (such as $libdir, $datadir) may be automatically
created, and only variables which are used are output.

  Variables and Keywords

pkg-config distinguishes between *variables* and *keywords*. Values for
both may include interpolated variables, as in "Cflags: -I ${include}".

Some commonly used variables have dedicated command line options:

  --prefix     : base prefix for paths
  --package    : filesystem compatible package name
  --modversion : package version

("--modversion" sets the *version* variable; the "--version" flag will
output the version of "mkpkgconfig").

"--modversion" is required. "--prefix" and "--package" may be required
if a keyword requires them or "--auto" is set and auto-generated
variables require it.

Common keywords also have dedicated options:

  --Name
  --Conflicts
  --Description
  --Requires
  --Libs
  --Cflags
  --URL

The "--Name" and "--Description" options are required. The "Version"
keyword is automatically set to "${version}". It is not possible to set
it directly from the command line.

Other variables and keywords may be specified via the "--var" and
"--kwd" options, respectively:

  --var name=value
  --kwd name=value

which may be used more than once.

  Automatically Generated Variables

"mkpkgconfig" can automatically generate a number of "standard"
variables, such as *bindir*, *libdir*, etc, based upon the *prefix*
variable. Use the "--list-auto" option to output a list of these
variables.
