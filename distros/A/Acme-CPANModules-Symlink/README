NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::Symlink - List of modules that deal with symbolic
    links (symlinks)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::Symlink
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-Symlink), released on
    2022-03-18.

DESCRIPTION
    Creating

    Perl provides the "symlink" builtin.

    Setup::File::Symlink can create/fix/delete symlink. Part of the Setup
    module family, the functions in this module are idempotent with
    transaction/undo support.

    Finding

    Perl provides the "-l" operator to test if a file or filehandle is a
    symbolic link. This performs an "lstat()" call, which unlike "stat()"
    can detect if a handle is symbolic link.

    Testing

    Test::Symlink

    File::MoreUtil provides some utilities that are symlink-aware, like
    "l_abs_path" and "file_exists".

    Other utilities

    File::Symlink::Relative creates relative symbolic links.

    File::Symlink::Util provides utility routines related to symlinks.

    More specific utilities

    File::LinkTree::Builder

    short (from App::short).

    lntree (from <pm:App::lntree) to create a mirror based on symlinks.

    Windows symlinks

    Win32::NTFS::Symlink

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n Symlink

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries Symlink | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=Symlink -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::Symlink -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::Symlink::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
