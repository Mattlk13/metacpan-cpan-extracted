NAME
    App::rimetadb - Manage a Rinci metadata database

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.226 of App::rimetadb (from Perl
    distribution App-rimetadb), released on 2023-07-09.

SYNOPSIS
    See the included CLI script rimetadb.

FUNCTIONS
  argument_stats
    Usage:

     argument_stats(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Show statistics on function arguments from the database.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dsn => *str*

        DBI connection DSN.

        If not specified, will default to "dbd:SQLite:$HOME/rimeta.db" where
        $HOME is user's home directory.

        Note: has been tested with MySQL and SQLite only.

    *   password => *str*

        DBI connection password.

    *   user => *str*

        DBI connection user.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

    Update Rinci metadata database from local Perl modules.

    This routine scans Perl modules, load them, and update the database
    using Rinci metadata from each modules into the database.

    For each package, function, or function argument metadata, you can put
    this attribute:

     'x.app.rimetadb.exclude' => 1,

    to exclude the entity from being imported into the database. When you
    exclude a package, all its contents (currently functions) are also
    excluded.

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   delete => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to delete packages from DB if no longer mentioned as
        arguments or found in filesystem.

    *   exclude => *array[perl::modname_or_prefix]*

        Perl package names or prefixes to exclude.

        You can also use this attribute in your package metadata:

         'x.app.rimetadb.exclude' => 1,

        to exclude the package (as well as its contents: all functions) from
        being imported into the database.

    *   force_update => *bool*

        Force update database even though module hasn't changed since last
        update.

    *   library => *dirname*

        Include library path, like Perl's -I.

        Note that some modules are already loaded before this option takes
        effect. To make sure you use the right library, you can use
        "PERL5OPT" or explicitly use "perl" and use its "-I" option.

    *   module_or_package* => *array[perl::modname_or_prefix]*

        Perl module or prefixes or package to add/update.

        For each entry, you can specify:

        *   a Perl module name e.g. "Foo::Bar". An attempt will be made to
            load that module.

        *   a module prefix ending with "::" e.g. "Foo::Bar::".
            "Module::List" will be used to list all modules under
            "Foo::Bar::" recursively and load all those modules.

        *   a package name using "+Foo::Bar" syntax. An attempt to load
            module with that name will *not* be made. This can be used to
            add an already-loaded package e.g. by another module).

        *   a package prefix using "+Foo::Bar::" or "+Foo::Bar::" syntax.
            Subpackages will be listed recursively (using
            Package::Util::Lite's "list_subpackages").

    *   password => *str*

        DBI connection password.

    *   require => *array[perl::modname]*

        Require a Perl module, a la Perl's -m.

    *   use => *array[perl::modname]*

        Use a Perl module, a la Perl's -M.

    *   user => *str*

        DBI connection user.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
