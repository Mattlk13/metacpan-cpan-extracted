VERSION

INSTALL

        cpan Alien::libvas

DESCRIPTION

    See Proc::Memory for a Perl wrapper that makes use of this
    distribution.

PLATFORMS

    libvas claims compatiblity with WinAPI's
    ReadProcessMemory/WriteProcessMeory, macOS/GNU Hurd Mach API, Linux
    procfs /proc/pid/mem, ptrace (2), and
    process_vm_readv/process_vm_writev, SunOS procfs /proc/pid/as and
    finally BSD with ptrace (2) or procfs.

    I don't have all these systems to verify this. So please report bugs
    you might run into, preferably on Github. :-)
