NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::GettingTempDir - Getting system-wide temporary
    directory in a portable way

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::GettingTempDir (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-GettingTempDir), released on 2019-01-09.

DESCRIPTION
    Getting system-wide temporary directory in a portable way.

    There's the good ol' File::Spec which has a "tmpdir" function. On Unix
    it looks at "TMPDIR" environment variable before falling back to "/tmp".
    File::Temp uses this for its "tempdir" when a template is not specified.

    Then there's File::Util::Tempdir which tries a little harder. On Unix,
    its "get_tempdir" will look at "TMPDIR", then also "TEMPDIR", "TMP",
    "TEMP". If none of those are set, it will return the first existing
    directory from the list: "/tmp", "/var/tmp". If everything fails, will
    die.

    File::Util::Tempdir also provides "get_user_tempdir" which returns a
    user-private temporary directory, which can be useful if you want to
    create temporary file with predetermined names. It will return temporary
    directory pointed by "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" (e.g. "/run/user/1000") or, if
    unavailable, will create a subdirectory under the world-writable
    temporary directory (e.g. "/tmp/1000").
