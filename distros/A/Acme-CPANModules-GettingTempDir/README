NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::GettingTempDir - List of ways of getting system-wide
    temporary directory in a portable way

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::GettingTempDir (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-GettingTempDir), released on 2023-10-29.

DESCRIPTION
    There's the good ol' File::Spec which has a "tmpdir" function. On Unix
    it looks at "TMPDIR" environment variable before falling back to "/tmp".
    File::Temp uses this for its "tempdir" when a template is not specified.

    Then there's File::Util::Tempdir which tries a little harder. On Unix,
    its "get_tempdir" will look at "TMPDIR", then also "TEMPDIR", "TMP",
    "TEMP". If none of those are set, it will return the first existing
    directory from the list: "/tmp", "/var/tmp". If everything fails, will
    die.

    File::Util::Tempdir also provides "get_user_tempdir" which returns a
    user-private temporary directory, which can be useful if you want to
    create temporary file with predetermined names. It will return temporary
    directory pointed by "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" (e.g. "/run/user/1000") or, if
    unavailable, will create a subdirectory under the world-writable
    temporary directory (e.g. "/tmp/1000").

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n GettingTempDir

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries GettingTempDir | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=GettingTempDir -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::GettingTempDir -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::GettingTempDir::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
