0.004    11 Feb 2018 11:18 MST
         Suppress overloading in botch messages for object-related assertions (but not others).
         Method-related assertions now require a blessed invocant or a known package.
         Don't carp if we're throwing an exception and exceptions are trapped.
         Support more than one word in ASSERT_CONDITIONAL (eg: "carp,always").
         If ASSERT_CONDITIONAL contains "handlers", don't block @SIG{__{WARN,DIE}__}.
         Don't let assert_isa die prematurely on an unblessed ref.

0.005    Sun May 20 20:40:25 CDT 2018
         Initial beta release.
	 Reworked the hash key checkers into a simpler set: assert_keys, assert_min_keys, assert_max_keys, assert_minmax_keys.
         Added invocant-specific assertions: assert_{object,class}_{isa,ainta,can,cant}.
         Added assertions for ties, overloads, and locked hashes.
         Made assert_private_method work despite Moose wrappers.
         Added assert_protected_method that works despite Moose wrappers and roles.
         Improved the looks of the uncompiled code for assert_happy_code.
         Improved the reporting of some assertion failures.

0.006    Mon May 21 07:45:43 CDT 2018
         Use hash_{,un}locked not hashref_{,un}locked to support pre-5.16 perls.
         Unhid assert_unblessed_ref swallowed up by stray pod.

0.007    Mon May 21 19:13:58 CDT 2018
         Add missing Hash::Util version requirement for old perls to get hashref_unlock imported.

0.008    Tue May 22 11:51:37 CDT 2018
         Rewrite hash_unlocked missing till 5.16 as !hash_locked
         Add omitted etc/generate-exporter-pod to MANIFEST

0.009    Tue Aug 21 06:29:56 MDT 2018
         Delay slow calls to uca_sort till you really need them, credit Larry Leszczynski.

0.010    Sun Jul 19 13:52:00 MDT 2020
         Fix coredump in perl 5.12 by replacing UNITCHECK in Assert::Conditional::Util with normal execution at botton.
         Make perls below 5.18 work again by setting Hash::Util prereq in Makefile.PL to 0 because it's in the core only, never cpan.
         Only provide assert_locked and assert_unlocked if core Hash::Util v0.15 is there (starting perl v5.17).
         Bump version req of parent class Exporter::ConditionalSubs to v1.11.1 so we don't break Devel::Cover.
         Normalize Export sub attribute tracing so either $Exporter::Verbose=1 or env ASSERT_CONDITIONAL_DEBUG=1 work for both Assert::Conditional{,::Utils}.
         Mentioned $Exporter::Verbose support.
