Assert-Conditional

This alpha release introduces conditional asssertions that can get
compile-time removed so they don't take up any run time in production but
are active during testing.

Currently 5.12 is required due to issues with Attribute::Handlers,
but this module is intended to work with 5.10.

The POSIX-related assertions that rely on functions like WIFEXITED
won't work on non-POSIX systems.
