NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::OrganizingCPAN - Efforts to organize CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::OrganizingCPAN (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-OrganizingCPAN), released on 2021-06-03.

DESCRIPTION
    This list catalog efforts to organize CPAN and help users navigate the
    sea of modules on CPAN.

    Bundles and Tasks

    A "Bundle::*" module lists several modules that will all get installed
    simply by installing the Bundle module. A later project Task aims to
    address some of the shortcomings of "Bundle::*" modules.

    CPANAuthors

    Acme::CPANAuthors::* modules contains lists of CPAN author ID's, grouped
    by some criteria.

    CPANModules

    Acme::CPANModules::* modules contains lists of CPAN modules (or
    scripts), grouped by some criteria.

    Map of CPAN

    The Map of CPAN project, <https://mapofcpan.org>, visualizes modules on
    CPAN as a map, with top namespaces with lots of modules under them
    appearing as islands while less popular namespaces are shown in the
    water regions.

    CPAN ratings

    CPAN ratings, <https://cpanratings.perl.org/>, is an inactive project
    that allows users to rate and review any CPAN module. In 2018, it no
    longer accepts new submission. But all existing submissions are still
    browsable.

    PrePAN

    Calling itself "Social Reviewing for Perl Modules", <http://prepan.org/>
    lets an author post about a module she plans to release, or perhaps just
    an idea of a module, to get input on name, interface, or what have you.
    Alternatively, the usual places where Perl communities hang out can be
    used for this use-case, including the Perl subreddit
    (<https://reddit.com/r/perl>), IRC channels (see
    <https://irc.perl.org>), or PerlMonks (https://www.perlmonks.org>).
