NAME
    App::GnuplotUtils - Utilities related to plotting data using gnuplot

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of App::GnuplotUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-GnuplotUtils), released on 2023-10-21.

DESCRIPTION
    This distributions provides the following command-line utilities. They
    are mostly simple/convenience wrappers for gnuplot:

    *   xyplot

FUNCTIONS
  xyplot
    Usage:

     xyplot(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Plot XY dataset(s) using gnuplot.

    This utility is a wrapper for gnuplot to quickly generate a graph from
    the command-line and view it using an image viewer program or a browser.

    Specifying dataset

    You can specify the dataset to plot directly from the command-line or
    specify filename to read the dataset from.

    To plot directly from the command-line, specify comma-separated list of
    X & Y number pairs using "--dataset-data" option:

     % xyplot --dataset-data '1,1, 2,3, 3,5.5, 4,7.9, 6,11.5' ; # whitespaces are optional

    To add more datasets, specify more "--dataset-data" options:

     % xyplot --dataset-data '1,1, 2,3, 3,5.5, 4,7.9, 6,11.5' \
              --dataset-data '1,4,2,4,3,2,4,9,5,3,6,6';         # will plot two lines

    To add a title to your chart and every dataset, use "--dataset-title":

     % xyplot --chart-title "my chart" \
              --dataset-title "foo" --dataset-data '1,1, 2,3, 3,5.5, 4,7.9, 6,11.5' \
              --dataset-title "bar" --dataset-data '1,4,2,4,3,2,4,9,5,3,6,6'

    To specify dataset from files, use one or more "--dataset-file" options
    (or specify the filenames as arguments):

     % xyplot --dataset-file ds1.txt --dataset-file ds2.txt
     % xyplot ds1.txt ds2.txt

    "ds1.txt" should contain comma, or whitespace-separated list of X & Y
    numbers. You can put one number per line or more.

     1 1
     2 3
     3 5.5
     4 7.9
     6 11.5
     8
     13.5
     9 14.2 10 14.8

    To accept data from stdin, you can specify "-" as the filename:

     % tabulate-drug-concentration ... | xyplot -

    Seeing plot result

    "xyplot" uses Desktop::Open to view the resulting plot. The module will
    first find a suitable application, and failing that will use the web
    browser. If you specify "--output-file" ("-o"), the plot is written to
    the specified image file.

    Keywords

    xychart, XY chart, XY plot

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   chart_title => *str*

        (No description)

    *   dataset_datas => *array[str]*

        Dataset(s).

    *   dataset_files => *array[filename]*

        Dataset(s) from file(s).

    *   dataset_styles => *array[str]*

        Dataset plot style(s).

    *   dataset_titles => *array[str]*

        Dataset title(s).

    *   field_delimiter => *str*

        Supply field delimiter character in dataset file instead of the
        default whitespace(s) or comma(s).

    *   output_file => *filename*

        (No description)

    *   overwrite => *bool*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
