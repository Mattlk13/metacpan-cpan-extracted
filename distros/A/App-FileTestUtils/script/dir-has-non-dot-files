=head1 NAME

dir-has-non-dot-files - Test that a directory has non-dot files

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.005 of dir-has-non-dot-files (from Perl distribution App-FileTestUtils), released on 2023-11-30.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

On the command-line, you feed a filename as argument to the script and it will
exit 0 if the filename exists and is a directory that has non-dot files:

 % dir-has-non-dot-files "foo" && echo "foo/ has non-dot files"

With grep mode (C<-g>), you pass one or more filenames in argument or stdin to
the script and it will print the directories that have non-dot files (or those
that are not, if you specify C<-v> or C<--invert-match>).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is CLI for L<File::Util::Test>'s
L<dir_has_non_dot_files|File::Util::Test/dir_has_non_dot_files>. It will exit 0 if
argument is a directory and has plain, non-dot (a.k.a. non-hidden) files. A
plain file is a regular/non-special file. A symlink to a plain file counts as a
plain file. Non-plain files include named pipes, Unix sockets, and
block/character special files.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
