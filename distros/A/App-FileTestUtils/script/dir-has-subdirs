=head1 NAME

dir-has-subdirs - Test that a directory has subdirs

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.003 of dir-has-subdirs (from Perl distribution App-FileTestUtils), released on 2021-10-13.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

On the command-line, you feed a filename as argument to the script and it will
exit 0 if the filename exists and is a directory that has subdirs:

 % dir-has-subdirs "foo" && echo "foo/ has subdirs"

With grep mode (C<-g>), you pass one or more filenames in argument or stdin to
the script and it will print the directories that have subdirs (or those that
are not, if you specify C<-v> or C<--invert-match>).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is CLI for L<File::MoreUtil>'s L<dir_empty|File::MoreUtil/dir_has_subdirs>.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
