NAME
    App::rpgrep - Print lines matching a Regexp::Pattern pattern

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::rpgrep (from Perl
    distribution App-rpgrep), released on 2020-02-09.

FUNCTIONS
  rpgrep
    Usage:

     rpgrep(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Print lines matching a Regexp::Pattern pattern.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all => *true*

        Require all patterns to match, instead of just one.

    *   anchor => *bool*

        Generate an anchored version of the pattern.

    *   color => *str*

    *   count => *true*

        Supress normal output, return a count of matching lines.

    *   files => *array[filename]*

    *   gen_args => *hash*

        Supply generator arguments.

        If pattern is a dynamic pattern (generated on-demand) and the
        generator requires some arguments, you can supply them here.

    *   ignore_case => *bool*

    *   invert_match => *bool*

        Invert the sense of matching.

    *   line_number => *true*

    *   pattern* => *regexppattern::name*

        Name of pattern, with module prefix but without the
        'Regexp::Pattern'.

    *   quiet => *true*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
