FUNCTIONS
  delete_all_empty_dirs
    Usage:

     delete_all_empty_dirs() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Delete all empty (zero-sized) subdirectories recursively.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    No arguments.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
