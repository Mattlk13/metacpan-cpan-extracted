=head1 NAME

this-mod - Return name of Perl module associated with the current directory

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.009 of this-mod (from Perl distribution App-ThisDist), released on 2021-04-02.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would L<this-dist>:

 % pwd
 /home/budi/perl-Foo-Bar

 % this-mod
 Foo::Bar

=head2 Some recipes

Show L<MetaCPAN|https://metacpan.org> module documentation page in browser
(requires L<lcpan> from L<App::lcpan>). (But note that for this particular task,
I have also written L<this-mod-on-metacpan>.)

 % lcpan metacpan-mod `this-mod`

Same thing, but without using any other script:

 % firefox https://metacpan.org/pod/`this-mod`

(Re)install this module using L<cpanminus|App::cpanminus>:

 % cpanm -n --reinstall `this-mod`

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is a wrapper to L<this-dist>, converting the result like C<Foo-Bar>
into C<Foo::Bar>.
