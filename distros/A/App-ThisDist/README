FUNCTIONS
  this_dist
    Usage:

     my $dist = this_dist([ $dir ] [ , $extract_version? ]); => e.g. "App-Foo" or "App-Foo 1.23"

    If $dir is not specified, will default to current directory. If
    $extract_version is set to true, will also try to extract distribution
    version and will return "?" for version when version cannot be found.

  this_mod
    A thin wrapper for "this_dist". It just converts "-" in the result to
    "::", so "Foo-Bar" becomes "Foo::Bar".
