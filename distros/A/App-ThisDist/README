NAME
    App::ThisDist - Print Perl {distribution,module,author,...} associated
    with current directory

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.014 of App::ThisDist (from Perl
    distribution App-ThisDist), released on 2022-05-03.

DESCRIPTION
    See included scripts:

    *   this-dist

    *   this-mod

FUNCTIONS
  this_dist
    Usage:

     my $dist = this_dist([ $dir ] [ , $extract_version? ]); => e.g. "App-Foo" or "App-Foo 1.23"

    If $dir is not specified, will default to current directory. If
    $extract_version is set to true, will also try to extract distribution
    version and will return "?" for version when version cannot be found.

  this_mod
    A thin wrapper for "this_dist". It just converts "-" in the result to
    "::", so "Foo-Bar" becomes "Foo::Bar".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
