=head1 NAME

dump-pericmd-script - Run a Perinci::CmdLine-based script but only to dump the object

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.053 of dump-pericmd-script (from Perl distribution App-PericmdUtils), released on 2022-05-14.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

% B<dump-pericmd-script> [B<--config-path>=I<path>|B<-c>|B<--no-config>|B<-C>] [B<--config-profile>=I<profile>|B<-P>] [B<--format>=I<name>|B<--json>] [(B<--lib>=I<str>)+] [B<--method>=I<str>] [B<--(no)naked-res>] [B<--no-env>] [B<--page-result>[=I<program>]|B<--view-result>[=I<program>]] [B<--skip-detect>|B<-D>] [B<--libs-json>=I<json>|(B<-I>=I<str>)+] -- E<lt>I<filename>E<gt>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function runs a CLI script that uses C<Perinci::CmdLine> (or its variant
C<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite> or C<Perinci::CmdLine::Any>) but monkey-patches
C<Perinci::CmdLine::Base> beforehand so that C<run()> will dump the object and
then exit. The goal is to get the object without actually running the script.

This can be used to gather information about the script and then generate
documentation about it (e.g. C<Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Rinci> to insert POD sections
based on information from the Rinci metadata of the function used by the script)
or do other things (e.g. C<App::shcompgen> to generate a completion script for
the original script).

CLI script needs to use C<Perinci::CmdLine>. This is detected currently by a
simple regex. If script is not detected as using C<Perinci::CmdLine>, status 412
is returned.

Will return the C<Perinci::CmdLine> object dump. In addition to that, if detected
that script refers to function URL C</main> (which might mean that function
metadata is embedded in the script itself and not in a separate module), will
also dump the target function's metadata in C<func.meta> in this function's
result metadata.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--filename>=I<s>*, B<-f>

Path to the script.

Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--lib>=I<s@>, B<-I>

Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--libs-json>=I<s>

Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script (JSON-encoded).

See C<--lib>.

=item B<--method>=I<s>

Valid values:

 ["patch","self-dump"]

The `patch` method is using monkey-patching to replace run() with a routine that
dumps the object and exit. This has a disadvantage of exiting too early, for
example some attributes like `common_opts` is filled during run(). Another
method is `self-dump` that requires <pm:Perinci::CmdLine::Lite> version 1.73 or
later.

The default is to use `self-dump`, but `patch` for /main/.


=item B<--skip-detect>, B<-D>

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C dump-pericmd-script dump-pericmd-script

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete dump-pericmd-script 'p/*/`dump-pericmd-script`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F</home/u1/.config/dump-pericmd-script.conf>, F</home/u1/dump-pericmd-script.conf>, or F</etc/dump-pericmd-script.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

You can also filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable equals some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable includes some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not include some string: C<[env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

To load and configure plugins, you can use either the C<-plugins> parameter (e.g. C<< -plugins=DumpArgs >> or C<< -plugins=DumpArgs@before_validate_args >>), or use the C<[plugin=NAME ...]> sections, for example:

 [plugin=DumpArgs]
 -event=before_validate_args
 -prio=99
 
 [plugin=Foo]
 -event=after_validate_args
 arg1=val1
 arg2=val2

 

which is equivalent to setting C<< -plugins=-DumpArgs@before_validate_args@99,-Foo@after_validate_args,arg1,val1,arg2,val2 >>.

 filename (see --filename)
 format (see --format)

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
