=head1 NAME

cpanm-shcompgen - Install modules from CPAN (and activate shell completion)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of cpanm-shcompgen (from Perl distribution App-cpanm-shcompgen), released on 2017-07-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use L<cpanm>:

 % cpanm-shcompgen -n Some::Module ...

To alias it as C<cpanm> in your shell, e.g. in bash:

 alias cpanm=cpanm-shcompgen

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<cpanm-shcompgen> is a simple wrapper over L<cpanm>. This command:

 % cpanm-shcompgen -n App::PMUtils

is equivalent to:

 % perl -MModule::Load::In::INIT=App::cpanminus::script::Patch::RunShcompgen cpanm -n App::PMUtils

That is, it will cause B<cpanm> to execute L<shcompgen> (C<shcomgen generate
...>) for all the installed scripts in the distribution. This means, shell tab
completion will be activated immediately after installation.
