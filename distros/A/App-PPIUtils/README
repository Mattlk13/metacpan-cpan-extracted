NAME
    App::PPIUtils - Command-line utilities related to PPI

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::PPIUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-PPIUtils), released on 2020-10-02.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities related
    to PPI:

    *   reverse-perl-subs

    *   sort-perl-subs

FUNCTIONS
  reverse_perl_subs
    Usage:

     reverse_perl_subs(%args) -> any

    Reverse Perl subroutines.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename => *filename* (default: "-")

        Path to Perl script/module.

    Return value: (any)

  sort_perl_subs
    Usage:

     sort_perl_subs(%args) -> any

    Sort Perl named subroutines by their name.

    This utility sorts Perl subroutine definitions in source code. By
    default it sorts asciibetically. For example this source:

     sub one {
        ...
     }
 
     sub two { ... }
 
     sub three {}

    After the sort, it will become:

     sub one {
        ...
     }
 
     sub three {}
 
     sub two { ... }

    Caveat: if you intersperse POD documentation, currently it will not be
    moved along with the subroutines.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename => *filename* (default: "-")

        Path to Perl script/module.

    *   sort_args => *array[str]*

        Arguments to pass to the Sort::Sub::* routine.

    *   sort_sub => *sortsub::spec*

        Name of a Sort::Sub::* module (without the prefix).

    Return value: (any)
