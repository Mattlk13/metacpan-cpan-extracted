=head1 NAME

App::lcpan::Cmd::dist2author - Get author of distribution(s)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.070 of App::lcpan::Cmd::dist2author (from Perl distribution App-lcpan), released on 2022-03-27.

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 handle_cmd

Usage:

 handle_cmd(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

Get author of distribution(s).

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<cpan> => I<dirname>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. E<sol>pathE<sol>toE<sol>cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.

=item * B<dists>* => I<array[perl::distname]>

Distribution names (e.g. Foo-Bar).

=item * B<index_name> => I<filename> (default: "index.db")

Filename of index.

If C<index_name> is a filename without any path, e.g. C<index.db> then index will
be located in the top-level of C<cpan>. If C<index_name> contains a path, e.g.
C<./index.db> or C</home/ujang/lcpan.db> then the index will be located solely
using the C<index_name>.

=item * B<use_bootstrap> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to turn this
off.


=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or something like "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is the actual result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional metadata.

Return value:  (any)

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-lcpan>

patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
