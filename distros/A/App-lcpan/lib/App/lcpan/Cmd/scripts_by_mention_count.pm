This shows the list of most mentioned scripts, that is, scripts who are
linked/referred to the most in PODs.

By default, each source module/script that mentions a script is counted as one
mention (`--count-per content`). Use `--count-per dist` to only count mentions
by modules/scripts from the same dist as one mention (so a script only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per dist). Use `--count-per author` to only count mentions by
modules/scripts from the same author as one mention (so a script only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per mentioning author).

By default, only mentions from other authors are included. Use
`--include-self-mentions` to also include mentions from the same author.

=head1 NAME

App::lcpan::Cmd::scripts_by_mention_count - List scripts ranked by number of mentions

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.028 of App::lcpan::Cmd::scripts_by_mention_count (from Perl distribution App-lcpan), released on 2018-11-29.

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 handle_cmd

Usage:

 handle_cmd(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

List scripts ranked by number of mentions.

This shows the list of most mentioned scripts, that is, scripts who are
linked/referred to the most in PODs.

By default, each source module/script that mentions a script is counted as one
mention (C<--count-per content>). Use C<--count-per dist> to only count mentions
by modules/scripts from the same dist as one mention (so a script only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per dist). Use C<--count-per author> to only count mentions by
modules/scripts from the same author as one mention (so a script only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per mentioning author).

By default, only mentions from other authors are included. Use
C<--include-self-mentions> to also include mentions from the same author.

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<count_per> => I<str> (default: "content")

=item * B<cpan> => I<dirname>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.

=item * B<include_self_mentions> => I<bool> (default: 0)

=item * B<index_name> => I<filename> (default: "index.db")

Filename of index.

If C<index_name> is a filename without any path, e.g. C<index.db> then index will
be located in the top-level of C<cpan>. If C<index_name> contains a path, e.g.
C<./index.db> or C</home/ujang/lcpan.db> then the index will be located solely
using the C<index_name>.

=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
(msg) is a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is
200. Third element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
element (meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information.

Return value:  (any)
