=head1 NAME

App::lcpan::Cmd::deps - List dependencies

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.035 of App::lcpan::Cmd::deps (from Perl distribution App-lcpan), released on 2019-06-26.

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 handle_cmd

Usage:

 handle_cmd(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

List dependencies.

By default only runtime requires are displayed. To see prereqs for other phases
(e.g. configure, or build, or ALL) or for other relationships (e.g. recommends,
or ALL), use the C<--phase> and C<--rel> options.

Note that dependencies information are taken from C<META.json> or C<META.yml>
files. Not all releases (especially older ones) contain them. L<lcpan> (like
MetaCPAN) does not extract information from C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL> because
that requires running (untrusted) code.

Also, some releases specify dynamic config, so there might actually be more
dependencies.

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<cpan> => I<dirname>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.

=item * B<flatten> => I<bool>

Instead of showing tree-like information, flatten it.

When recursing, the default is to show the final result in a tree-like table,
i.e. indented according to levels, e.g.:

 % lcpan deps -R MyModule
 | module            | author  | version |
 |-------------------|---------|---------|
 | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
 |   Bar             | AUTHOR2 | 0.23    |
 |   Baz             | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
 | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

To be brief, if C<Qux> happens to also depends on C<Bar>, it will not be shown in
the result. Thus we don't know the actual C<Bar> version that is needed by the
dependency tree of C<MyModule>. For example, if C<Qux> happens to depends on C<Bar>
version 0.45 then C<MyModule> indirectly requires C<Bar> 0.45.

To list all the direct and indirect dependencies on a single flat list, with
versions already resolved to the largest version required, use the C<flatten>
option:

 % lcpan deps -R --flatten MyModule
 | module            | author  | version |
 |-------------------|---------|---------|
 | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
 | Bar               | AUTHOR2 | 0.45    |
 | Baz               | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
 | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

Note that C<Bar>'s required version is already 0.45 in the above example.

=item * B<include_core> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Include core modules.

=item * B<include_noncore> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Include non-core modules.

=item * B<index_name> => I<filename> (default: "index.db")

Filename of index.

If C<index_name> is a filename without any path, e.g. C<index.db> then index will
be located in the top-level of C<cpan>. If C<index_name> contains a path, e.g.
C<./index.db> or C</home/ujang/lcpan.db> then the index will be located solely
using the C<index_name>.

=item * B<level> => I<int> (default: 1)

Recurse for a number of levels (-1 means unlimited).

=item * B<modules>* => I<array[perl::modname]>

=item * B<perl_version> => I<str> (default: "v5.26.1")

Set base Perl version for determining core modules.

=item * B<phase> => I<str> (default: "runtime")

=item * B<rel> => I<str> (default: "requires")

=item * B<use_bootstrap> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to turn this
off.

=item * B<with_xs_or_pp> => I<bool>

Check each dependency as XS/PP.

=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
(msg) is a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is
200. Third element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth
element (meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information.

Return value:  (any)
