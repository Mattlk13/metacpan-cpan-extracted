=head1 NAME

=head1 VERSION

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 handle_cmd

Usage:

 handle_cmd(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

Show a single distribution.

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<cpan> => I<dirname>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. E<sol>pathE<sol>toE<sol>cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.

=item * B<dist>* => I<perl::distname>

=item * B<index_name> => I<filename> (default: "index.db")

Filename of index.

If C<index_name> is a filename without any path, e.g. C<index.db> then index will
be located in the top-level of C<cpan>. If C<index_name> contains a path, e.g.
C<./index.db> or C</home/ujang/lcpan.db> then the index will be located solely
using the C<index_name>.

=item * B<use_bootstrap> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to turn this
off.


=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or something like "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is the actual result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional metadata.

Return value:  (any)
