SYNOPSIS

    See lcpan script.

HISTORY

    This application began as CPAN::SQLite::CPANMeta, an extension of
    CPAN::SQLite. CPAN::SQLite parses 02packages.details.txt.gz and
    01mailrc.txt.gz and puts the parse result into a SQLite database.
    CPAN::SQLite::CPANMeta parses the META.json/META.yml files in
    individual release files and adds it to the SQLite database.

    In order to simplify things for the users (one-step indexing) and get
    more freedom in database schema, lcpan skips using CPAN::SQLite and
    creates its own SQLite database. It also parses
    02packages.details.txt.gz but does not parse distribution names from it
    but instead uses META.json and META.yml files extracted from the
    release files. If no META.* files exist, then it will use the module
    name.
