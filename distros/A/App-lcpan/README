SYNOPSIS
    See lcpan script.

FUNCTIONS
  authors
    Usage:

     authors(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List authors.

    Examples:

    *   List all authors:

         authors();

    *   Find CPAN IDs which start with something:

         authors( query => ["MICHAEL%"]); # -> undef

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   added_or_updated_since => *date*

        Include only records that are added/updated since a certain date.

    *   added_or_updated_since_last_index_update => *true*

        Include only records that are added/updated since the last index
        update.

    *   added_or_updated_since_last_n_index_updates => *posint*

        Include only records that are added/updated since the last N index
        updates.

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan".

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   index_name => *filename* (default: "index.db")

        Filename of index.

        If "index_name" is a filename without any path, e.g. "index.db" then
        index will be located in the top-level of "cpan". If "index_name"
        contains a path, e.g. "./index.db" or "/home/ujang/lcpan.db" then
        the index will be located solely using the "index_name".

    *   or => *bool*

        When there are more than one query, perform OR instead of AND logic.

    *   query => *array[str]*

        Search query.

    *   query_type => *str* (default: "any")

    *   use_bootstrap => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

        If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to
        turn this off.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

    By default will return an array of CPAN ID's. If you set "detail" to
    true, will return array of records.

  deps
    Usage:

     deps(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List dependencies of distributions.

    Examples:

    *   List what modules Module-List requires:

         deps( dists => ["Module-List"]);

    *   List modules Module-List requires (module name will be converted to
        distro name):

         deps( dists => ["Module::List"]);

    *   List non-core modules Module-List requires:

         deps( dists => ["Module-List"], include_core => 0);

    *   List dependencies of a specific distribution release:

         deps( dists => ["Module-List\@0.004"]);

    By default only runtime requires are displayed. To see prereqs for other
    phases (e.g. configure, or build, or ALL) or for other relationships
    (e.g. recommends, or ALL), use the "--phase" and "--rel" options.

    Note that dependencies information are taken from "META.json" or
    "META.yml" files. Not all releases (especially older ones) contain them.
    lcpan (like MetaCPAN) does not extract information from "Makefile.PL" or
    "Build.PL" because that requires running (untrusted) code.

    Also, some releases specify dynamic config, so there might actually be
    more dependencies.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   added_or_updated_since => *date*

        Include only records that are added/updated since a certain date.

    *   added_or_updated_since_last_index_update => *true*

        Include only records that are added/updated since the last index
        update.

    *   added_or_updated_since_last_n_index_updates => *posint*

        Include only records that are added/updated since the last N index
        updates.

    *   added_since => *date*

        Include only records that are added since a certain date.

    *   added_since_last_index_update => *true*

        Include only records that are added since the last index update.

    *   added_since_last_n_index_updates => *posint*

        Include only records that are added since the last N index updates.

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan".

    *   dists* => *array[perl::distname_with_optional_ver]*

        Distribution names (with optional version suffix, e.g.
        Foo-Bar@1.23).

    *   dont_uniquify => *bool*

        Allow showing multiple modules for different dists.

    *   flatten => *bool*

        Instead of showing tree-like information, flatten it.

        When recursing, the default is to show the final result in a
        tree-like table, i.e. indented according to levels, e.g.:

         % lcpan deps -R MyModule
         | module            | author  | version |
         |-------------------|---------|---------|
         | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
         |   Bar             | AUTHOR2 | 0.23    |
         |   Baz             | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
         | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

        To be brief, if "Qux" happens to also depends on "Bar", it will not
        be shown in the result. Thus we don't know the actual "Bar" version
        that is needed by the dependency tree of "MyModule". For example, if
        "Qux" happens to depends on "Bar" version 0.45 then "MyModule"
        indirectly requires "Bar" 0.45.

        To list all the direct and indirect dependencies on a single flat
        list, with versions already resolved to the largest version
        required, use the "flatten" option:

         % lcpan deps -R --flatten MyModule
         | module            | author  | version |
         |-------------------|---------|---------|
         | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
         | Bar               | AUTHOR2 | 0.45    |
         | Baz               | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
         | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

        Note that "Bar"'s required version is already 0.45 in the above
        example.

    *   include_core => *bool* (default: 1)

        Include core modules.

    *   include_indexed => *bool* (default: 1)

        If "index_name" is a filename without any path, e.g. "index.db" then

        contains a path, e.g. "./index.db" or "/home/ujang/lcpan.db" then
        the index will be located solely using the "index_name".

HISTORY
    This application began as CPAN::SQLite::CPANMeta, an extension of
    CPAN::SQLite. "CPAN::SQLite" parses "02packages.details.txt.gz" and
    "01mailrc.txt.gz" and puts the parse result into a SQLite database.
    "CPAN::SQLite::CPANMeta" parses the "META.json"/"META.yml" files in
    individual release files and adds it to the SQLite database.

    In order to simplify things for the users (one-step indexing) and get
    more freedom in database schema, "lcpan" skips using "CPAN::SQLite" and
    creates its own SQLite database. It also parses
    "02packages.details.txt.gz" but does not parse distribution names from
    it but instead uses "META.json" and "META.yml" files extracted from the
    release files. If no "META.*" files exist, then it will use the module
    name.
