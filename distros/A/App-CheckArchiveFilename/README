    *   Example #1:

         check_archive_filename(filenames => ["foo.bar", "qux.Zip", "quux.tar.xz"]);

        Result:

           200,
           "OK",

             { filename => "foo.bar", is_archive => 0 },
             {
               filename => "qux.Zip",
               is_archive => 1,
               archive_name => "Zip",
               filename_without_suffix => "qux",
               archive_suffix => ".Zip",
             },
             {
               filename                => "quux.tar.xz",
               is_archive              => 1,
               is_compressed           => 1,
               archive_name            => "tar",
               compressor_name         => "XZ",
               compressor_suffix       => ".xz",
               archive_suffix          => ".tar",
               filename_without_suffix => "quux",
             },
           ],
           {
             "table.fields" => [
               "filename",
               "is_archive",
               "is_compressed",
               "archive_name",
               "compressor_name",
               "compressor_suffix",
             ],

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filenames* => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
