NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithXLS - Working with Excel formats (XLS,
    XLSX) or other spreadsheet formats like LibreOffice Calc (ODS)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithXLS (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-WorkingWithXLS), released on 2022-08-10.

DESCRIPTION
    The following are tools (programs, modules, scripts) to work with Excel
    formats (XLS, XLSX) or other spreadsheet formats like LibreOffice Calc
    (ODS).

    Parsing

    Spreadsheet::Read is a common-interface front-end for
    Spreadsheet::ReadSXC (for reading LibreOffice Calc ODS format) or one of
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX, or Spreadsheet::XLSX
    (for reading XLS or XLSX, although Spreadsheet::XLSX is strongly
    discouraged because it is a quick-and-dirty hack). Spreadsheet::Read can
    also read CSV via Text::CSV_XS. The module can return information about
    cell's attributes (formatting, alignment, and so on), merged cells, etc.

    Getting information

    Spreadsheet::Read

    xls-info from App::XLSUtils

    Iterating/processing with Perl code

    XLSperl CLI from App::XLSperl lets you iterate each cell (with 'XLSperl
    -ne' or row with 'XLSperl -ane') with a Perl code, just like you would
    each line of text with "perl -ne" (in fact, the command-line options of
    XLSperl mirror those of perl). Only supports the old Excel format (XLS
    not XLSX). Does not support LibreOffice Calc format (ODS). If you feed
    it unsupported format, it will fallback to text iterating, so if you
    feed it XLSX or ODS you will iterate chunks of raw binary data.

    Converting to CSV

    "CATDOC" (<http://www.wagner.pp.ru/~vitus/software/catdoc/>) contains
    following the programs "catdoc" (to print the plain text of Microsoft
    Word documents to standard output), xls2csv (to convert Microsoft Excel
    workbook files to CSV), and "catppt" (to print plain text of Mirosoft
    PowerPoint presentations to standard output). Available as Debian
    package. They only support the older format (XLS and not XLSX). They do
    not support LibreOffice Calc format (ODS).

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n WorkingWithXLS

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries WorkingWithXLS | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=WorkingWithXLS -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::WorkingWithXLS -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::WorkingWithXLS::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
