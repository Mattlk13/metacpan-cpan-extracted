NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ReadingFilesBackward - Reading files backward (in
    reverse)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ReadingFilesBackward (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ReadingFilesBackward), released on 2020-03-01.

DESCRIPTION
    Reading files backward (in reverse).

    Probably the fastest way, if you are on a Unix system, is to use the tac
    command, which can read a file line by line in reverse order, or
    paragraph by paragraph, or character by character, or word by word, or
    by a custom separator string or regular expression. Example for using it
    from Perl:

     open my $fh, "tac /etc/passwd |";
     print while <$fh>;

    Another convenient way is to use the Perl I/O layer PerlIO::reverse. It
    only does line-by-line reversing, but you can use the regular Perl API.
    You don't even have to "use" the module explicitly (but of course you
    have to get it installed first):

     open my $fh, "<:reverse", "/etc/passwd";
     print while <$fh>;

    If your file is small (fits in your system's memory), you can also slurp
    the file contents first into an array (either line by line, or paragraph
    by paragraph, or what have you) and then simply "reverse" the array:

     open my $fh, "<", "/etc/passwd";
     my @lines = <$fh>;
     print for reverse @lines;

    If the above solutions do not fit your needs, there are also these
    modules which can help: File::ReadBackward, File::Bidirectional.
    File::ReadBackward is slightly faster than File::Bidirectional, but
    File::Bidirectional can read forward as well as backward. I now simply
    prefer PerlIO::reverse because I don't have to use a custom API for
    reading files.

INCLUDED MODULES
    *   PerlIO::reverse

    *   File::ReadBackward

    *   File::Bidirectional

FAQ
  What are ways to use this module?
    Aside from reading it, you can install all the listed modules using
    cpanmodules:

        % cpanmodules ls-entries ReadingFilesBackward | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=ReadingFilesBackward -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful result for "lcpan
    related-mods" when it comes to finding related modules for the modules
    listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
