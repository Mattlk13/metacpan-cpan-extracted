NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::ReadingFilesBackward - List of modules to read files
    backward (in reverse)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Acme::CPANModules::ReadingFilesBackward (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-ReadingFilesBackward), released on 2023-10-31.

DESCRIPTION
    Probably the fastest way, if you are on a Unix system, is to use the tac
    command, which can read a file line by line in reverse order, or
    paragraph by paragraph, or character by character, or word by word, or
    by a custom separator string or regular expression. Example for using it
    from Perl:

     open my $fh, "tac /etc/passwd |";
     print while <$fh>;

    Another convenient way is to use the Perl I/O layer PerlIO::reverse. It
    only does line-by-line reversing, but you can use the regular Perl API.
    You don't even have to "use" the module explicitly (but of course you
    have to get it installed first):

     open my $fh, "<:reverse", "/etc/passwd";
     print while <$fh>;

    If your file is small (fits in your system's memory), you can also slurp
    the file contents first into an array (either line by line, or paragraph
    by paragraph, or what have you) and then simply "reverse" the array:

     open my $fh, "<", "/etc/passwd";
     my @lines = <$fh>;
     print for reverse @lines;

    If the above solutions do not fit your needs, there are also these
    modules which can help: File::ReadBackward, File::Bidirectional.
    File::ReadBackward is slightly faster than File::Bidirectional, but
    File::Bidirectional can read forward as well as backward. I now simply
    prefer PerlIO::reverse because I don't have to use a custom API for
    reading files.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n ReadingFilesBackward

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries ReadingFilesBackward | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=ReadingFilesBackward -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::ReadingFilesBackward -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::ReadingFilesBackward::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
