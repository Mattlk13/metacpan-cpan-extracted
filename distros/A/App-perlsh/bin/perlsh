F<perlsh> - a simple F<perl> REPL based on C<Lexical::Persistence>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ perlsh
 eval: 1 + 2
 '3'

 eval:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script runs an instance of L<App::perlsh>, which provides a simple perl
REPL ("read-execute-print loop").

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 -b, --blib

Imports the L<blib> module at startup, which prefers built code in the
F<blib/> directory if such exists. This is useful for commandline testing or
experimenting with newly-built perl modules before they are installed.
