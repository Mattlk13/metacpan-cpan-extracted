NAME
    `App::perlsh' - a simple perl REPL based on `Lexical::Persistence'

SYNOPSIS
     use App::perlsh;

     App::perlsh->run

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements an application that provides a simple perl REPL
    ("read-execute-print loop"); that is, an interactive shell-like program
    that repeatedly reads perl code from input, executes it, and prints the
    result in a readable manner.

    Being based on Lexical::Persistence allows it to accumulate variables
    along the session, letting the user reuse them in later lines.

      $ perlsh
      eval: my $one = 1;
      '1'

      eval: my $two = 2;
      '2'

      eval: $one + $two
      '3'

      eval:
