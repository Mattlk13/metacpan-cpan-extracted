=head1 NAME

DuckPAN - The DuckDuckHack Developer Tool

=head1 INSTALLATION

Please see L<https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan#installing-duckpan> for DuckPAN installation instructions

=over 4

=item C<duckpan> OR C<duckpan help> OR C<man duckpan>

Shows you the DuckPAN help page which briefly describes DuckPAN and its features.

=back

=head2 FOR INSTANT ANSWER DEVELOPERS

=over 4

=item C<duckpan check>

Checks if you fulfill all requirements for the development environment. This will run automatically during a B<duckpan release>.

=item C<duckpan query> [package_name ...]

Test Goodie and Spice triggers interactively on the command line. For each query, the Instant Answers triggered will be displayed. This tool should be used to ensure your Instant Answer triggers correctly.

[package_name ...]:
Loads only the specified Spice or Goodie Instant Answers.

Examples:
duckpan query Npm
duckpan query Twitter IsItUp

=item C<duckpan server> [--port <number>] [package_name ...]

Starts a local web server, which emulates the DuckDuckGo production environment. Allows for live testing of Goodie and Spice Instant Answers. This tool should be used to ensure your Instant Answer displays correctly. For Spice Instant Answers, this is especially important to verify API calls are successful and no JavaScript errors exist.

-p, --port <number>:
Forces DuckPAN server to run on the specified port (default port is 5000)

[package_name ...]:
Loads only the specified Spice or Goodie Instant Answers.

Examples:
duckpan server Movie
duckpan server IDN Sort Morse

=item C<duckpan new> [package name]

Generates all necessary files for a new Spice or Goodie Instant Answer (depending on the current repo). DuckPAN will prompt you for a package name and generate the required files. If the name is already in use, DuckPAN will let you know and no files will be created.

=item C<duckpan test>

Tests your release, by running the tests in the B<t/> directory using Dzil (if a dist.ini exists) or prove. This will run automatically during a B<duckpan release>.

=item C<duckpan installdeps>

Attempt to install dependencies for the distribution in your current directory using cpanm.

=item C<duckpan roadrunner>

Same as installdeps, but without testing them. Meep meep!

=item C<duckpan publisher>

Starts a local web server which displays static websites created with L<DuckDuckGo-Publisher|https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-publisher>.

=item C<duckpan update>

Update DuckPAN to the latest version.
