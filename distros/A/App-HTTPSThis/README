NAME
    App::HTTPSThis - Export the current directory over HTTPS

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::HTTPSThis (from Perl
    distribution App-HTTPSThis), released on 2017-10-11.

SYNOPSIS
     # Not to be used directly, see https_this command

DESCRIPTION
    This is a fork of App::HTTPThis for HTTPS version instead of HTTP.

    This class implements all the logic of the https_this command.

    Actually, this is just a very thin wrapper around Plack::App::Directory,
    that is where the magic really is.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new App::HTTPSThis object, parsing the command line arguments
    into object attribute values.

  run
    Start the HTTPS server.
