Revision history for Perl extension AnyEvent::Fork::RPC

TODO: better exit conditions in Async, see Art Sackett mail
TODO: allow overtaking existing $fh
TODO: compatible $0 method, somehow

1.24  Tue Mar 26 05:18:55 CET 2019
	- check if connection has succeeded, rather than crashing
          (based on patch by Johan Finnved).
        - add t/03_connfail.t testcase by Johan Finnved.

1.23  Thu Nov 10 17:31:14 CET 2016
        - async backend had an optimization for EV that failed to
          actually trigger when EV was used (analyzed by sten).
	- adapt to new AnyEvent::Fork process name.

1.22  Thu May 12 18:53:37 CEST 2016
	- add $CBOR_XS_SERIALISER.

1.21  Tue Oct 15 10:52:09 CEST 2013
	- work around perl 5.14 and earlier bug causing
          "Goto undefined subroutine &CORE::exit" messages.

1.2   Wed Sep 25 13:05:46 CEST 2013
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: remove dependency on, and autoloading
          of, AnyEvent::Fork.
	- provide an eof option to specify an alternative to exiting
          in the asynchronous backend.
        - add $NSTORABLE_SERIALISER.
        - use "AE::log die" instead of die to report uncaught errors.
        - ->run now provides a better $0 (as seen in some ps outputs).
        - add a nice async Coro RPC server example.
        - add an example of how to use AnyEvent::Log and on_event to
          forward log messages to the parent.
        - work around bugs in the TCP/IP stack on windows, aborting
          connections instead of properly closing them on exit.
        - log any errors via AE::log fatal instead of die'ing in the
          async backend.

1.1   Sun Apr 28 15:48:17 CEST 2013
	- add support for the AnyEvent::Fork::Remote API.
        - switch to an ABI-independent protocol.
	- emit clearer diagnostic for some broken cpan-testers setups.

0.2   Sun Apr 21 14:26:16 CEST 2013
        - do not create a watcher when shutting down the object, shut down
          directly, to work around perl global destruction bugs.
        - expliticly call exit in child server - not elegant, but
          doesn't disturb any sane perl, and helps broken win32 perls
          to clean up.

0.1   Thu Apr 18 15:29:48 CEST 2013
	- first release.

0.00  Tue Apr 16 21:40:55 CEST 2013
	- post planning, pre writing.
