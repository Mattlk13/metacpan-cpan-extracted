NAME

    Acme::DarmstadtPM::TieHash - a module that shows that Perl can do all
    the Ruby things ;-)

VERSION

    version 0.5

SYNOPSIS

      #!/usr/bin/perl
       
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use Test::More tests => 2;
      
      use constant ADT => 'Acme::DarmstadtPM::TieHash';
       
      use_ok(ADT);
       
      tie my %hash,ADT,sub{$_[0] + $_[-1]};
      
      is($hash{[1,5]},6,'Check [1,5]');
       
      untie %hash;

DESCRIPTION

    Ronnie sent a mail to the mailinglist with some good Ruby stuff. I
    said, that all these things can be done in Perl, too. So this module is
    a proof how smart Perl is...
