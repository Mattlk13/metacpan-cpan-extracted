=head1 NAME

Montenbruck - Lightweight Ephemeris

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Library of astronomical calculations, based on
I<"Astronomy On The Personal Computer"> by I<O.Montenbruck> and I<T.Phleger>,
I<Fourth Edition, Springer-Verlag, 2000>.

There are many astronomical libraries available in the public domain. While
giving accurate results, they often suffer from lack of convenient API,
documentation and maintainability. Most of the source code is written in C, C++
or Java, and not dynamic languages. So, it is not easy for a layman to customize
them for her custom application, be it an online lunar calendar, or tool for
amateur sky observations. This library is an attempt to find a middle-ground
between precision on the one hand and compact, well organized code on the other.

=head2 Accuracy

As authors of the book state, they have tried to obtain an accuracy that is
approximately the same as that found in astronomical yearbooks.

  "The errors in the fundamental routines for determining the coordinates
  of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets amount to about 1″-3″."
