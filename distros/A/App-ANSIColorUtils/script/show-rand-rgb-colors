=head1 NAME

show-rand-rgb-colors - Produce N random RGB colors using rand_rgb_colors() and show the results

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.008 of show-rand-rgb-colors (from Perl distribution App-ANSIColorUtils), released on 2021-01-19.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % show-rand-rgb-colors [--dark-color] [--format-options=s] [--format=name]
     [--json] [--light-color] [--light-or-dark-color] [--(no)naked-res]
     [--no-light-color] [--nolight-color] <n>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--dark-color>

Alias for --light-color.

See C<--no-light-color>.

=item B<--light-or-dark-color>

Alias for --light-color.

See C<--no-light-color>.

=item B<--no-light-color>

=item B<-n>=I<s>*

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format-options>=I<s>

Pass options to formatter.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Equivalent to --format=json-pretty.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C show-rand-rgb-colors show-rand-rgb-colors

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete show-rand-rgb-colors 'p/*/`show-rand-rgb-colors`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
