NAME
    App::FontUtils - Command-line utilities related to fonts and font files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::FontUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-FontUtils), released on 2022-08-30.

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides tha following command-line utilities related
    to fonts and font files:

    *   otf2ttf

    *   ttf2otf

FUNCTIONS
  otf2ttf
    Usage:

     otf2ttf(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Convert OTF to TTF.

    This program is a shortcut wrapper for fontforge. This command:

     % otf2ttf foo.otf

    is equivalent to:

     % fontforge -lang=ff -c 'Open($1); Generate($2); Close();' foo.otf foo.ttf

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   otf_file* => *filename*

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    *   ttf_file => *filename*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  ttf2otf
    Usage:

     ttf2otf(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Convert TTF to OTF.

    This program is a shortcut wrapper for fontforge. This command:

     % ttf2otf foo.ttf

    is equivalent to:

     % fontforge -lang=ff -c 'Open($1); Generate($2); Close();' foo.ttf foo.otf

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   otf_file => *filename*

    *   overwrite => *bool*

    *   ttf_file* => *filename*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

    "list-fonts" to list installed fonts on the system (in a cross-platform
    way). Tab completion. Filtering OTF/TTF, etc.

    "show-fonts <font names> [text]" to show how fonts look. Allow
    specifying wildcards. Allow specifying filename for source of text. Tab
    completion.

    "install-font <font files>" and "uninstall-font <font names>" to install
    and uninstall fonts (in a cross-platform way). Allow specifying
    regex/wildcard in uninstall. Tab completion.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
