NAME
    App::GeometryUtils - Utilities related to geometry

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::GeometryUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-GeometryUtils), released on 2024-06-25.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities related
    to geometry:

    *   calc-box-fit

    *   calc-box-surface-area

FUNCTIONS
  calc_box_fit
    Usage:

     calc_box_fit(%args) -> any

    Calculate how many small boxes fit inside a larger box.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         calc_box_fit(smaller_dimension => "5x3x2", larger_dimension => "35x19x18"); # -> "378 (94.74% full)"

    Keywords: packing algorithm, bin packing

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   allow_multiple_orientation => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   allow_rotation => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   larger_dimension* => *str*

        Dimension (LxWxH) of the smaller box.

    *   smaller_dimension* => *str*

        Dimension (LxWxH) of the smaller box.

    Return value: (any)

  calc_box_surface_area
    Usage:

     calc_box_surface_area(%args) -> float

    Calculate surface area of a box with specified dimension.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         calc_box_surface_area(dimension => "5x3x2"); # -> 62

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dimension* => *str*

        Dimension (LxWxH) of the box.

    Return value: (float)

SEE ALSO
    Box::Calc. Given one or more of "smaller boxes" ("items" in Box::Calc
    lingo) of different sizes, what kind and how many "larger boxes"
    ("boxes" in Box::Calc lingo) are needed for shipping?

    Algorithm::BinPack. This is a one-dimensional packing problem instead of
    3D one. Given multiple items of different size, and a container (bin)
    size, how many containers are needed?

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-GeometryUtils>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
