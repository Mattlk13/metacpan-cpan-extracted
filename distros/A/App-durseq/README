FUNCTIONS
  durseq
    Usage:

     durseq(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Generate a sequence of durations.

    This utility is similar to Perl script dateseq, except that it generates
    a sequence of durations instead of dates.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   format_class => *perl::modname* (default: "ISO8601")

        Use a DateTime::Format::Duration::* class for formatting.

        By default, "ISO8601" (DateTime::Format::Duration::ISO8601) is used.

    *   format_class_attrs => *hash*

        Arguments to pass to constructor of DateTime::Format::* class.

    *   from => *duration*

        Starting duration.

    *   increment => *duration*

        Increment, default is one day (P1D).

    *   limit => *int*

        Only generate a certain amount of items.

    *   reverse => *true*

        Decrement instead of increment.

    *   to => *duration*

        Ending duration, if not specified will generate an infinite* stream
        of durations.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
