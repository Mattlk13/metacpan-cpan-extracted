simpleXMLParse version 3.1 
===========================

simpleXMLParse - Perl extension for pure perl XML parsing 

SYNOPSIS

  use simpleXMLParse;
  use Data::Dumper;
  my $parse = new simpleXMLParse(input => $fn, style => $style);

  print Dumper($parse->parse());

DESCRIPTION

  simpleXMLParse currently does not handle DTD's or DTD syntax. 

  style is "1" or "2".

  style "1" will create attribute key-value pairs with an "_attr" suffix convention
      This style is useful if one is traversing the data structure and needs to know an attribute value before descending
      into the node.
  style "2" will create attribute key-value pairs in same format as nodes while handling collisions
      This is the same style as XML::Simple, with the exception that on the collision of an attribute name and node name,
      XML::Simple will push the attribute to the top of the array, whereas simpleXMLParse will rename the attribute <name>1.

  NOTES ABOUT version 3.1
  =======================

  Testing: used Data::Compare to compare parses of about 10000 XML files with the results of XML::Simple. The files found
  on my Linux box successfully compared 90%. On Windows it was more like 60%. Most of the differences were debatable.
  For example, some XML files have an <href> tag in the middle of some free-form text. XML::Simple pulls the tag data out
  and makes a key/value node out of it, with the text chopped into separate nodes. simpleXMLParse leaves the <href> embedded
  in the text. Also, for some tags that have only whitespace, such as newlines, XML::Simple will ignore the whitespace and
  make the node a {}. simpleXMLParse, in the spirit of typsetting tools, will make the node equal to ' ', for example.

  BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY to 3.0 and earlier was not maintained in the following, in order to conform to the XML::Simple standard:
  the keyword "VALUE" was replaced by "content"
  empty nodes will now be {} instead of '' 

EXPORT

  None by default.
