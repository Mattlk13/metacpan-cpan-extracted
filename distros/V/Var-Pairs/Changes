    (thanks John)

    Allowed each_kv to work correctly on different containers
    that are passed to the same call: each_kv( %{$some_ref} )
    (thanks John!)

    Strip out autoderefs to continue working under 5.23+
    (thanks, Slaven)

    Improve identification of each unique context
    (by adding use of context())

    Refactor Var::Pairs::Pair to avoid use of Data::Alias
    under Perl 5.24+
    (thanks Salvatore)



0.003002  Sat Aug 20 16:49:20 2016

0.003005  Mon May  7 06:55:18 2018

    Made each_pair() and each_kv() clean themselves up
    at the end of their caller's block, to solve the
    "last of out a loop messes up the iterator" problem.
    (Thanks, Rolf!)
