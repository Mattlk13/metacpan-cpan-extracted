NAME
    Variable::Temp - Temporarily change the value of a variable.

VERSION
    Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        use Variable::Temp 'temp';

        my $x = 1;
        say $x; # 1
        {
         temp $x = 2;
         say $x; # 2
        }
        say $x; # 1

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an utility routine that can be used to temporarily
    change the value of a scalar, array or hash variable, until the end of
    the current scope is reached where the original value of the variable is
    restored. It is similar to "local", except that it can be applied onto
    lexicals as well as globals, and that it replaces values by copying the
    new value into the container variable instead of by aliasing.

FUNCTIONS
  "temp"
        temp $var;
        temp $var = $value;

        temp @var;
        temp @var = \@value;

        temp %var;
        temp %var = \%value;

    Temporarily replaces the value of the lexical or global variable $var by
    $value (respectively @var by @value, %var by %value), or by "undef" if
    $value is omitted (respectively empties @var and %var if the second
    argument is omitted), until the end of the current scope. Any subsequent
    assignments to this variable in the current (or any inferior) scope will
    not affect the original value which will be restored into the variable
    at scope end. Several "temp" calls can be made onto the same variable,
    and the restore are processed in reverse order.

    Note that destructors associated with the variable will not be called
    when "temp" sets the temporary value, but only at the natural end of
    life of the variable. They will trigger after any destructor associated
    with the replacement value.

    Due to a shortcoming in the handling of the "\$" prototype, which was
    addressed in "perl" 5.14, the pseudo-statement "temp $var = $value" will
    cause compilation errors on "perl" 5.12.x and below. If you want your
    code to run on these versions of "perl", you are encouraged to use
    "set_temp" instead.

  "set_temp"
        set_temp $var;
        set_temp $var => $value;

        set_temp @var;
        set_temp @var => \@value;

        set_temp %var;
        set_temp %var => \%value;

    A non-lvalue variant of "temp" that can be used with any version of
    "perl".
