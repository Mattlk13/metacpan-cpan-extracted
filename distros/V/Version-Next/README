NAME
    Version::Next - increment module version numbers simply and correctly

VERSION
    version 1.000

SYNOPSIS
      use Version::Next qw/next_version/;

      my $new_version = next_version( $old_version );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple, correct way to increment a Perl module
    version number. It does not attempt to guess what the original version
    number author intended, it simply increments in the smallest possible
    fashion. Decimals are incremented like an odometer. Dotted decimals are
    incremented piecewise and presented in a standardized way.

    If more complex version manipulation is necessary, you may wish to
    consider Perl::Version.

USAGE
    This module uses Sub::Exporter for optional exporting. Nothing is
    exported by default.

  "next_version"
      my $new_version = next_version( $old_version );

    Given a string, this function make the smallest logical increment and
    returns it. The input string must be a "lax" version numbers as defined
    by the version module. The string "undef" is treated as 0 and
    incremented to 1. Leading or trailing periods have a 0 (or "v0")
    prepended or appended as appropriate. For legacy reasons, given no
    argument or a literal "undef" (not the string "undef"), the function
    returns 0.

    Decimal versions are incremented like an odometer, preserving the
    original number of decimal places. If an underscore is present
    (indicating an "alpha" version), its relative position is preserved.
    Examples:

      0.001    ->   0.002
      0.999    ->   1.000
      0.1229   ->   0.1230
      0.12_34  ->   0.12_35
      0.12_99  ->   0.13_00

    Dotted-decimal versions have the least significant element incremented
    by one. If the result exceeds 999, the element resets to 0 and the next
    most significant element is incremented, and so on. Any leading zero
    padding is removed. Examples:

     v1.2.3     ->  v1.2.4
     v1.2.999   ->  v1.3.0
     v1.999.999 ->  v2.0.0

    NOTE: Due to changes in the interpretation of dotted-decimal version
    numbers with alpha elements in version 0.9913 and later, the notion of
    the 'next' dotted-decimal alpha is ill-defined. Version::Next no longer
    supports dotted-decimals with alpha elements and a fatal exception will
    be thrown if one is provided to "next_version".
