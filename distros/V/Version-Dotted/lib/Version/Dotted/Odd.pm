=head1 NAME

Version::Dotted::Odd - Odd/even versioning scheme

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.0.1, released on 2017-01-04 21:35 UTC.

=head1 WHAT?

C<Version::Dotted> and its subclasses are I<authoring time> extensions to core C<version> class:
they complement C<version> with bump operation and implement alternative trial version criteria.

This is C<Version::Dotted::Odd> module documentation. However, read C<Version::Dotted>
module documentation first, since it contains many relevant details.

General topics like getting source, building, installing, bug reporting and some
others are covered in the F<README>.

=for test_synopsis my ( $v, $bool );

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Version::Dotted::Odd;       # import nothing
    use Version::Dotted::Odd 'qv';  # import qv

    # Construct:
    $v = Version::Dotted::Odd->new( v1.0 );     # v1.0.0 (at least 3 parts)
    $v = qv( v1.0.2.5 );    # v1.0.2.5

    # Release status:
    $bool = $v->is_trial;   # true if the second part is odd.

    # See Version::Dotted for other methods.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is subclass of C<Version::Dotted>. Two features distinct it from the parent:

=over

=item *

Version object always has at least 3 parts.

    $v = qv( v1 );          # v1.0.0
    $v->part( 0 ) == 1;     # Parts 0, 1, 2 are always defined.
    $v->part( 1 ) == 0;     # Zero if not specified explicitly.
    $v->part( 2 ) == 0;     # ditto
    $v->part( 3 ) == undef; # But may be defined.

=item *

The second part defines the release status: odd number denotes a trial release.

    $v = qv( v1.0 );        # $v == v1.0.0
    $v->is_trial;           # false
    $v->bump( 1 );          # $v == v1.1.0
    $v->is_trial;           # true

Such versioning scheme was used by Linux kernel (between 1.0 and 2.6) and still used by Perl.

=back

=head1 CLASS ATTRIBUTES

=head2 min_len

Minimal number of parts, read-only.

    $int = Version::Dotted::Odd->min_len;   # == 3

C<Version::Dotted::Odd> objects always have at least 3 parts.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 is_trial

Returns true in case of trial version, and false otherwise.

    $bool = $v->is_trial;

A version is considered trial if the second part is an odd number:

    qv( v1.1.3 )->is_trial;     # true
    qv( v1.2.0 )->is_trial;     # false
