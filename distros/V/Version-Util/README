NAME
    Version::Util - Version-number utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.732 of Version::Util (from Perl
    distribution Version-Util), released on 2022-09-22.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides several convenient functions related to version
    numbers, e.g. for comparing them.

FUNCTIONS
  cmp_version($v1, $v2) => -1|0|1
    Equivalent to:

     version->parse($v1) <=> version->parse($v2)

  version_eq($v1, $v2) => BOOL
  version_ne($v1, $v2) => BOOL
  version_lt($v1, $v2) => BOOL
  version_le($v1, $v2) => BOOL
  version_gt($v1, $v2) => BOOL
  version_ge($v1, $v2) => BOOL
  version_between($v, $v1, $v2[, $v1b, $v2b, ...]) => BOOL
  version_in($v, $v1[, $v2, ...]) => BOOL
  min_version($v1, ...) => $max_v
  max_version($v1, ...) => $max_v
  add_version($v, $increment) => $new_v
    Add $increment to version $v. Both increment and version must match:

     /\Av?\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){0,2}\z/

    so trial/dev releases like "v1.2.3_1" are not currently supported. Some
    examples:

     0.1 + 0.1 -> 0.2
     0.01 + 0.001 -> 0.011
     0.01 + 0.1 -> 0.11
     0.9 + 0.1 -> 1.0
     0.99 + 0.1 -> 1.09
     1.1.0 + 0.0.1 -> 1.1.1

  subtract_version($v, $decrement) => $new_v
    Subtract $decrement from version $v. This is the reverse operation for
    "add_version".

    Will die if the result is negative.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
