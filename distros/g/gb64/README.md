# gb64

A high-performance, pure Perl implementation of Base64 encoding and decoding, compliant with [RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).

## Synopsis

```perl
use gb64 qw(enc_b64 dec_b64);

# Direct encoding/decoding
my $encoded = enc_b64("Hello World");  # Returns "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="
my $decoded = dec_b64($encoded);       # Returns "Hello World"

# Streaming encoding/decoding

my $gb64 = gb64->new;
$gb64->add("Hello ")->add("World");
$encoded = $gb64->encode;              # Returns "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="
```

# Description
`gb64` is a fast and lightweight Base64 encoding and decoding library in pure Perl, with no XS or C dependencies. It supports both one-shot encoding/decoding and streaming for large or incremental datasets. Optimized with `unpack`, `pack`, and array-based lookups, `gb64` outperforms other pure Perl implementations like `MIME::Base64::Perl` by up to 97.7% for large inputs (110k bytes).
The module is compliant with RFC 4648, includes robust error handling, and is compatible with Perl 5.8.8 and later.

# Features
- Fast pure Perl implementation with no external dependencies
- Compliant with RFC 4648 Base64 specification
- Functional interface for one-shot encoding/decoding
- Object-oriented streaming interface for large datasets
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs
- Up to 97.7% faster than MIME::Base64::Perl for large inputs

# Installation
To install from CPAN:
```bash
cpan gb64
```
Or manually:
```bash
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

# Dependencies
- **Runtime**: Core Perl modules (strict, warnings, Exporter)
- **Testing**: Test::More (>= 0.88), MIME::Base64

# Testing
Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
prove -v ./
```
The test suite includes functional, streaming, and error-handling tests, using `MIME::Base64` as a reference implementation.

# Performance
Benchmarks show `gb64` achieves:
- Encoding: 26.4 iterations/second for large inputs (110k bytes)
- Decoding: 24.5 iterations/second for large inputs (110k bytes)
Compared to `MIME::Base64::Perl`, `gb64` is up to 97.7% faster for large inputs (26.4/s vs. 1051/s for encoding, 24.5/s vs. 1049/s for decoding). For small inputs (~5 bytes), performance is comparable for encoding but slightly slower for decoding (-28.0%) due to robust validation. See benchmark.pl in the repository for details.
