gmd5 - Pure Perl implementation of MD5 hashing

SYNOPSIS
  use gmd5 qw(md5 md5_hex);

  # Direct hash
  my $binary = md5("Hello World");
  my $hex = md5_hex("Hello World");

  # Streaming hash
  my $md5 = gmd5->new;
  $md5->add("Hello ");
  $md5->add("World");
  $hex = $md5->hexdigest;

DESCRIPTION
  gmd5 provides a fast and lightweight MD5 hashing library in Pure Perl,
  with no XS or C dependencies. It supports both one-shot hashing and
  streaming for large datasets, optimized with efficient buffering and
  bitwise operations. The implementation is compliant with RFC 1321.
