=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the low-level binding to the L<grpc|https://grpc.io> library.
This implementation only supports a grpc client.

To use it, there are currently two options:

* L<Google::ProtocolBuffers::Dynamic> to generate the client

* L<protoxs-perl|https://github.com/joyrex2001/protobuf-perlxs> to generate the client based on a proto2 file (see examples)
