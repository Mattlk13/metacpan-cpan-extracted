The packdrake module allows you to manipulate hdlist/synthesis files
It is a compatibility wrapper around the new MDV::Packdrakeng module.

genhdlist2 is used to generate an hdlist and an associated synthesis file for
one repository (medium in urpmi language).
A medium is from a set of RPM packages found in the directory.
It will put the hdlist and synthesis files in media_info/ sub-directory.

gendistrib is a wrapper above genhdlist2, it works on all media at once, in
order to generate a mirror tree for a distribution
