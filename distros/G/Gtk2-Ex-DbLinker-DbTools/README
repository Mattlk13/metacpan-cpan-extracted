DESCRIPTION

    This module automates the process of tying data from a database to
    widgets build with Gtk2 or Wx.

    Steps for use:

      * Create a DataManager object that contains the rows to display.
      Useone of DbiDataManager, SqlADataManager, RdbDataManager or
      DbcDataManager depending on how you access the database: DBI with
      plain sql commands or SQL::Abstract::More, DBIx::Class or
      Rose::DB::Object.

      * Create a Gtk2::GladeXML object to construct the Gtk2 windows or a
      xrc resource file to build a Wx Window. Names of the fields in the
      form have to be identical with the fields in the tables.

      * Create a Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker::Form or a Wx::Perl::DbLinker::Wxform
      object that links the data and the windows

      * Cnnect the buttons to methods that handle common actions such as
      inserting, moving, deleting, etc.
