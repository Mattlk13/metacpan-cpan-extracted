Geo::LibProj::FFI

This module is a foreign function interface to the PROJ
<https://proj.org/> coordinate transformation library. Please see the
PROJ library's C function reference
<https://proj.org/development/reference/functions.html> for further
documentation. You should be able to use those C functions as if they
were Perl.

This module is very incomplete. Version 0.01 does only little more than
what is necessary to support Geo::LibProj::cs2cs.
