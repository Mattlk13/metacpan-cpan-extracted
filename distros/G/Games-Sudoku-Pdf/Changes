Changes for Games::Sudoku::Pdf

v0.06 2024-06-25

	Bug #152360: Followed ANDK's recommendation to change required versions of imports from strings to barewords.

v0.05 2024-03-08

	Fix the fix: Testing the time format failed for UTC.

v0.04 2024-03-07

	Fix: Labour around faulty date validation in PDF::API2 2.042 to 2.044.

v0.03 2024-02-26

	Fix: Removed one forgotten global 'size' parameter to PDF::Table.

v0.02 2024-02-25

	Omitted the time zone offset minutes, together with the trailing apostrophe.
	This way we stay conformant with iso and adobe standards and PDF::API2 before v2.044 won't croak.
	Global 'size' and 'justify' replaced by 'column_props', which has better compatibility across PDF::Table versions.
	Changed the shebang in exe script from '/usr/bin/env perl' to just 'perl'. (Slaven Rezic)
	Renamed sudoku2pdf.pl to sudoku2pdf to make it look command-like.
	Fixed parameter name in example.pl.

v0.01 2024-02-24

	Initial Release.
