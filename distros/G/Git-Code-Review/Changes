    Performance improvement for the show command.

    In a large repository, processing all commits can take significantly
    longer than processing just the commit required. This change allows a
    couple of requests to be processed individually before the bulk
    computation kicks off.

    has the same name as the begining of another profile.

    As an example consider you have two profiles: team_awesome and
    team_awesome_and_smart When reviewing commits for team_awesome, the
    commits from team_awesome_and_smart also get picked.

    Adding a comment to a commit with comments shows a selection list of
    the commit and well as the comments. Trying to comment on another
    comment errors out with an "unknown commit object" error. This fix
    restricts the selection list to commits and thereby eliminates such
    errors.

    Optimise away many calls to getcwd

    In a reasonably large audit repository, we can end up calling
    getcwd() thousands of times, and this function may well be forking
    and exec-ing /bin/pwd. This is slow, and we never chdir anyway, so
    use the global variable initialised at startup instead.
