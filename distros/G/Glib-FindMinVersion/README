NAME

    Glib::FindMinVersion - Find minimum version of GLib needed to compile C
    source

SYNOPSIS

        use Glib::FindMinVersion;
    
        print Glib::FindMinVersion::with('g_get_num_processors'); # 2.36
        print scalar Glib::FindMinVersion::for_file('source.c'); # 2.18
        my %symbols = Glib::FindMinVersion::for_file('source.c' => 2.10);
        # (
        #   2.18 => [qw[g_set_error_literal]],
        #   2.12 => [qw[g_ascii_strtoll g_base64_decode]],
        # )
        

IMPLEMENTATION

    Symbol use is detected quite crudely with / \s* (?<symbol>\w+) \s* \(
    /x. Symbols introduced prior to 2.0 are labelled as 2.0.

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

    with(@symbols)

      Returns minimum GLib version which exports all @symbols.

    for_source($source [, $version])

      Here, [] denotes an optional argument. In list context, returns a
      listing of all found glib symbols grouped by version. If $version is
      given, the list is limited to symbols newer than $version. $version
      is a string of the form /2\.\d\d?/.

      In scalar context, returns the maximum version in the list, which is
      the minimum version required to use all the symbols.

    for_file($filename [, $version])

      Helper function that reads in $filename and passes it to for_source.

NAMING

    Official casing is GLib, but there's a Glib module already on CPAN, so
    this follows suit. This and the Glib module are unrelated though.
