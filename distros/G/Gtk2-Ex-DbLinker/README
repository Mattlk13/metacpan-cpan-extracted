DESCRIPTION

    This module automates the process of tying data from a database to
    widgets on a Glade-generated form. All that is required is that you
    name your widgets the same as the fields in your data source.

    Steps for use:

      * Create a DataManager object that contains the rows to display. Use
      DbiDataManager, RdbDataManager or DbcDataManager depending on how you
      access the database: sql commands and DBI, DBIx::Class or
      Rose::DB::Object

      * Create a Gtk2::GladeXML object to construct the Gtk2 windows

      * Create a Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker::Form object that links the data and
      the windows

      * You would then typically connect the buttons to the methods below
      to handle common actions such as inserting, moving, deleting, etc.
