Getopt-Long-CGI version 0.02
============================

Using the same syntax as Getopt::Long, scripts work on the command-line
in the same way. If the same script is called in a CGI-like environment it'll
change mode and display an HTML form of the options accepted on the
command-line - from which you can run the script and see the output.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires none outside the standard perl library, although may
in future perl versions require the 'CGI' module.
