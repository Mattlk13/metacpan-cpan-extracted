ldi / listdirection           Lists primary/secondary directions
 
   Format:
      ;ldi                    Lists directions
                              
   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      This command lists all primary and secondary directions stored in the
         current dictionary.

      See also the help for ';listautosecondary'.
