Ifaceselect$ (number)

   Synopsis:
      Returns the specified substring stored in the current interface
         notification

   Notes:
      The interface notification list contains all the notifications received,
         and not yet processed, as the result of an earlier SETTRIG statement.
      This function operates on the current notification (usually the first one
         see the help for SKIPIFACE).
      The specified substring is returned. The first substring is numbered 1,
         the second is numbered 2, and so on.
      If the specified substring doesn't exist in the notification, or if there
         is no current notification, returns an empty string.

   Compatibility:
      Since Axbasic v1.003
