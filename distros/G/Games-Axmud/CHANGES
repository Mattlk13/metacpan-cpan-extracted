v1.1.012 (8 Jun 2018)
---------------------

Major new features
- Text-to-speech (TTS) is now enabled on MS Windows. The Windows installer
    includes the eSpeak engine, so TTS will work out-of-the-box (no screenreader
    required)
- Added support for the 'espeak-ng' engine (on both Linux and MS Windows)

Major fixes
- Fixed issues with ';connect', ';reconnect' and ';xconnect' that especially
    affected visually-impaired users
- Fixed several issues on MS Windows. The GUI window will now open, the quick
    help file can be opened for viewing, and ';searchhelp' works again
- Autosave is now turned on by default. If you've installed a previous version
    of Axmud, your previous preferences are retained, so use ';autosave on' to
    turn on autosaves
- Fixed problems with clickable links, which caused Axmud to crash instantly
    when they occur at the end of a line
- Fixed incorrect handling of UTF-8 which made Russian-language MUDs unplayable
- Fixed packaging of Perl modules that caused CPAN archive to complain
- The .deb installer on Linux now adds two items to the Start menu, just like
    the corresponding MS Windows installer
