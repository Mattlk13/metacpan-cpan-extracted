v1.1.050 (31 Jul 2018)
----------------------

Pre-configured worlds
- Ten new pre-configured worlds: Age of Chaos, Avalon (Germany), Carrion Fields, CyberASSAULT,
    Elysium RPG, HellMOO, Miriani, MUME, RoninMUD, Tsunami
- Improved handling of new and existing pre-configured worlds for users who have just installed a
    new version of Axmud
- Major improvements to the existing pre-configured worlds: Avalon RPG, Discworld and SWMud (if
    you've ever connected to any of these worlds, you'll be prompted to update them; if not, the
    world profiles will be automatically updated)
- Minor improvements to the existing pre-configured worlds: Dead Souls Dev, Dead Souls Local, Dead
    Souls Prime, DuneMUD, Medievia, MorgenGrauen. If you want to import the improvements into your
    existing world profiles, use ';updateworld' (for example ';updatworld empire'). If you don't
    want to risk overwriting any changes you've made to those profiles, don't use ';updateworld'

Major new features
- New 'quick preferences' window, containing the most useful configuration options, such as changing
    fonts, turning on sound, etc (hopefully useful for users who couldn't find where they were). In
    the main window, click the blue book icon to open it
- The GUI window has been renamed the object viewer window, and expanded to include more kinds of
    object and more help files. The commands to open/close it are now ';openobjectviewer' and
    ';closeobjectviewer'
- New client commands to backup the entire Axmud data directory: 'backupdata', ';restoredata' and,
    for automated backups ';autobackup'. (This does not affect ordinary data file load/save
    operations. To avoid confusion, ';retainbackups' has been renamed ';retainfilecopy')
- A complete list of strings used in peek/poke operations (such as with the client commands ';peek'
    and ';poke', and with several Axbasic statements including PEEK and POKE) is now available in
    the About window, in the Axmud Guide and by using the new ';peekhelp' command
- For worlds that use room commands (such as EmpireMUD 2.0 and Avalon Germany), some new client
    commands: ';rommcommand', ';ignoreroomcommand', ';noticeroomcommand' and ';listroomcommand'.
    If the current location has a list of room commands like 'chop, harvest, gather', use
    ';roomcommand' to cycle through them. For best effect, open the Compass task and assign
    ';roomcommand' to one of the keys on your keypad
- New commands, aimed at worlds with a language that's not English, allowing you to set the
    dictionary's directions from the command line (e.g. at a German-language MUD, to replace 'east'
    with 'ost'): ';modifyprimary', ';addsecondary', ';modifysecondary', ';deletesecondary',
    ';setautosecondary', ';listautosecondary', ';listdirection'. Also fixed several problems setting
    directions in the dictionary's edit window

Major fixes
- Fixed crash due to problems with clickable links occasionally seen at MXP-heavy worlds
- Axmud is supposed to be able to recover from a Perl crash, commonly seen if you try to use an
    invalid regex (pattern) in your triggers and aliases. This wasn't working, which caused the
    connection to freeze, but it's now fixed
- Fixed multiple problems with command histories (used when you press the up/down cursor keys to
    show recent commands in the main window's command entry box)
- Fixed various ATCP problems which caused numerous error messages at some worlds
- At a few non-English worlds, the automapper produced a load of errors when leaving a dark room (a
    room with no light). Fixed

Minor new features
- The Inventory task can now cope with lines of text containing multiple items of inventory (in
    addition to the usual code, which could already cope with commas, the word 'and', and so on).
    Connect to HellMOO to see it in action
- ';copyrecording' now displays an abbreviated list of world commands, as well as the unabbreviated
    list

Minor fixes
- Some task windows (such as the Status task window) didn't have their fonts updated when the user
    updated fonts generally. Fixed
- ';playsoundeffect' now plays a random sound effect, if you don't specify one
- Fixed various problems in the zonemap and winmap edit windows. Fixed issue that prevented user
    adding winzones to a cloned winmap
- In the client preferences window, Workspaces > Page 5, fixed the faulty 'Reset Grids' button
- Autosaves no longer take place when connected to a world in 'offline' mode
- Fixed a few terminal error messages, occasionally seen when Axmud shuts down
- When Axmud displayed explicit line numbers and/or colour/style tags in the main window, clickable
    links appeared in the wrong place. Fixed
- Could not open the edit window for some room components from the world profile's edit window.
    Fixed, and in those edit windows there's a new button allowing you to specify RGB colour tags
- Fixed various problems in edit windows for TTS (text-to-speech) configurations
- New ';worldcompass' command, complementing the existing ';compass' and ';permcompass', and also
    improvements to the task's edit window, which make it easier to modify the commands for each
    keypad key that apply whenever Axmud starts
- ';listotherworld' has been renamed as ';listbasicworld' for consistency
- Fixed faulty handling, rarely affecting the user, of the delimiters in exit lists (for example
    the commas in 'You can go north, south, west'
- In the Connections window, you can now read English translations of the descriptions of non-
    English worlds

v1.1.012 (8 Jun 2018)
---------------------

Major new features
- Text-to-speech (TTS) is now enabled on MS Windows. The Windows installer
    includes the eSpeak engine, so TTS will work out-of-the-box (no screenreader
    required)
- Added support for the 'espeak-ng' engine (on both Linux and MS Windows)

Major fixes
- Fixed issues with ';connect', ';reconnect' and ';xconnect' that especially
    affected visually-impaired users
- Fixed several issues on MS Windows. The GUI window will now open, the quick
    help file can be opened for viewing, and ';searchhelp' works again
- Autosave is now turned on by default. If you've installed a previous version
    of Axmud, your previous preferences are retained, so use ';autosave on' to
    turn on autosaves
- Fixed problems with clickable links, which caused Axmud to crash instantly
    when they occur at the end of a line
- Fixed incorrect handling of UTF-8 which made Russian-language MUDs unplayable
- Fixed packaging of Perl modules that caused CPAN archive to complain
- The .deb installer on Linux now adds two items to the Start menu, just like
    the corresponding MS Windows installer

Minor fixes
- Numerous minor fixes

v1.1.0 (31 May 2018)
