# HEX DESCRIBE BIBLE
# INTRODUCTION
#
# This is a collaborative document that can build a usable and varied
# hexcrawl with the click of a button for those times when you can’t
# prep or the players wander off the map. It is a group of tables that
# can populate hexes of different terrain types using the web apps Hex
# Describe and Text Mapper by Alex Schroeder. To use it, open this
# url:
#
# https://campaignwiki.org/hex-describe/load/random/smale
#
# Then copy this entire document and paste it into the box that says
# “paste your tables here” and click submit. Voila! Your own
# procedurally-generated 23x18 hex map, completely populated. Here’s a
# guide to start contributing to the project quickly:
#
# http://iceandruin.blogspot.com/2018/04/how-to-add-entries-to-hex-describe.html
#
# And here’s a more comprehensive tutorial written by Alex:

#
# Guidelines for Collaboration
#
# Anyone can add to this document. You can add your own original work
# or tables you found online (with attribution). Please don’t add
# tables from a commercial work without permission. You can add on to
# existing tables or create new tables, but DON’T DELETE TABLES OR
# ALTER THE OVERALL FORMAT OF THIS DOCUMENT. It’s set up to work in a
# specific way and changing it around might break it. In general,
# please be careful that your changes don’t mess up others’ work. If
# you’d like to take this and run with it in a completely different
# direction, you can make a copy under the File menu.
#
# I will edit only for correct formatting, functionality, and
# readability. I will also try to make a backup copy every so often
# just in case the working copy gets fucked up. If you have any
# suggestions for me, you can reach me at +Matt Strom on G+.
#
# Format
#
# First, I’ve included “universal” tables that would be useful for all
# hex types - things like character traits, equipment, spells, etc.
# Add other universally useful tables here. The exception is tables of
# names - those go at the very end of the document because they’re
# long and take up so much space. There’s already like 70 pages of
# names.
#
# Then there are the sections for each hex type and their associated
# tables. The wilderness hex types are:
#
# bush, bushes, desert, fir-forest, forest, forest-hill,
# forest-mountain, forest-mountains, grass, hill, marsh, mountain,
# swamp, trees, water
#
# These all have the same format, and look like this:
#
# 0101 Hex type.
# Landmark:
# Encounter:
# NPC:
# Item:
#
# The settlement hex types are: castle, chaos, city, fields, keep,
# large-town, law, shrine, thorp, tower, town, village
#
# I’m still working on formats for these.
#
# A few conventions:
#
# Table names begin with a semicolon, and each entry begins with a
# weight number and comma. Everything else is a comment.
#
# Use comments copiously. Color them green.
#
# Bold the most important parts of longer entries by putting
# *asterisks* around them.
#
# For tables that are lists of things, include articles (as in “a
# sword”, not just “sword”). Don’t include articles when calling a
# list table (as in “The chest contains [object], not “The chest
# contains an [object]).
#
# To avoid confusion, don’t use abbreviations when naming tables.
#
# You can navigate much more easily by selecting “Show document
# outline” under the View menu. If you want your table to show up in
# the outline, set the table name text type to Heading 2 or Heading 3.
# I like to color them red.

;lyonesse hex
1,a wagon from which a pair of maidens tossed handfuls of pennies into the throng.
1,Blausreddin the pirate built a fortress at the back of a stony semi-circular harbor. His concern was not so much assault from the sea, but surprise attacks down from the pinnacles and gorges of the mountains, to the north of the harbor.
1,Go to Thripsey Shee just as the first rays of sunlight sweep down across the meadow. Do not go by moonlight, or you will suffer a death of weird invention.
1,What to do with the defeated magician, who seethed with evil and hate? Murgen rolled him up and forged him into a stout iron post, ten-foot long and thick as my leg. Then Murgen took this enchanted post to the crossroads and waited till it shifted to the proper place, then he drove the iron post down deep in the center, fixing the crossroads so it (Zak: the heretofore fugitive Goblin Fair) no longer could move, and all the folk at the Goblin Fair were glad, and spoke well of Murgen1,"Tell about Goblin Fair!" "Well then, it's the place and time when the halflings and men can meet and none will harm the other, so long as he stays polite.
1,the orangery
1,Hall of Honors beyond, where fifty-four great chairs, ranking the walls to right and left, represented the fifty-four most noble houses of Lyonesse…One chair was characterized by a shifting sidelong deceit, but pretended graceful charm; another exhibited a doomed and reckless bravery.
1,the crags Maegher and Yax: petrified giants who had helped King Zoltra Bright Star dredge Lyonesse Harbor; becoming obstreperous, they had been transformed into stone by Amber the sorcerer
1,On the rocks west of the Chale crawled cripples, lepers and the weak-minded, in accordance with the statutes of Lyonesse.
1,Each was spread-eagled naked to a frame and hung upside down, facing out to sea. Down from the Peinhador came Zerling, the Chief Executioner. He walked along the row, stopped by each man, slit the abdomen, drew out the intestines with a double-pronged hook, so that they fell over the chest and head, then moved on to the next.
1,…the Tower of Owls
1,He was compressed into an iron post seven feet tall and four inches square, so that only upon careful scrutiny might his distorted features be noted. This post was similar to the post at Twitten's Corner. The Sartzanek post was implanted at the very peak of Mount Agon. Whenever lightning struck down, Sartzanek's etched features were said to twitch and quiver.
1,In niches beside the entrance stood a pair of sphinxes carved from blocks of black diorite: the Tronen, or fetishes of the house.
1,A griffin's claw reposed in an onyx case.
1,a green meadow where rose an array of twenty poles, half supporting impaled corpses.
1,In the forest nearby a door opens into the otherwhere Irerly. One of us must go through this door and bring back thirteen gems of different colors, while the other guards the access.
1,isolated mountains of gray-yellow custard, each terminating in a ludicrous semi-human face. All faces were turned toward himself, displaying outrage and censure. Some showed cataclysmic scowls and grimaces, others produced thunderous belches of disdain. The most intemperate extruded a pair of liver-colored tongues, dripping magma which tinkled in falling, like small bells; one or two spat jets of hissing green sound, which Shimrod avoided, so that they struck other mountains, to cause new disturbance.
1,three competing religions: The Doctrine of Arcoid Clincture; the Shrouded Macrolith, which I personally consider a fallacy; and the noble Derelictionary Tocsin.
1,a jet of blue magma
1,Shimrod brought the House Eye down from the ridge-beam, and set it on the carved table in the parlor, where, upon stimulus, it recreated what it had observed during Shimrod's absence.
1,WITHIN AND ABOUT THE Forest of Tantrevalles existed a hundred or more fairy shees, each the castle of a fairy tribe
1,"Go your way and do not look back, on pain of seven years bad luck, for such is the manner one must leave a fairy shee."
1,a clearing planted with plum and apricot trees, which had long gone wild.
1,Before the hall the ground had been tilled and planted with cabbage, leeks, turnips, and onions, with currant bushes growing to the side. A dozen children, aged from six to twelve, worked in the garden under the vigilant eye of an overseer boy, perhaps fourteen years old. He was black-haired and thick-bodied, with an odd face: heavy and square above, then slanting in to a foxy mouth and a small sharp chin. He carried a rude whip, fashioned from a willow switch, with a cord tied to the end.
1,a set of dolmens, arranged to form the In-and-Out Maze, whose origin is unknown
1,In Wookin reside a vampire, a poison-eater, and a woman who converses with snakes.
1,On yonder hill I plan a great moon-trap, and when the moon comes walking and spying and peeping for to find my window, I'll pull the latch and then there'll be no more of my milk curdled on moony nights
1,I wait under gallows until the corpse drops, whereupon I assume possession of the clothes and valuables...
1,This gallows is known as Six-at-a-Gulp. Both law and custom forbid the hanging of five or four or three or two or one from the ancient beam
1,The festival had not yet commenced, but already booths, pavilions, platforms and other furniture of the fair were in the process of construction.
1,... Mysteries analyzed and resolved: incantations uttered in known and unknown languages. ... Dealer in analgesics, salves, roborants and despumatics.... Tinctures to relieve nausea, itch, ache, gripe, scurf, buboes, canker.
1,At Sinkings Gap you must pass under a boulder balanced on a pin. You must kill the guardian raven, or he will drop a feather to topple the boulder on your head.
1,At the River Siss an old woman with a fox's head and a chicken's legs will ask you to carry her across the river. You must act on the instant: cut her in half with your sword and carry each piece over separately
1,a kind of aviary thirty feet high and fifteen feet in diameter, equipped with perches, nests, feeders and swings. The human denizens of the aviary exemplified Carfilhiot's whimsy at its most pungent; he had amputated the limbs of several captives, both male and female and had substituted iron claws and hooks, with which they clung to the perches. Each was adorned with plumage of one sort or another; all twittered, whistled and sang bird-songs
1, a round chamber decorated in blue, pink and gold, and with a pale blue rug on the marble floor
1,a gantry twenty feet high from which hung four men with heavy stones dangling from their feet. Beside each stood a marker, measured off in inches…Let markers be placed; then when these miscreants have stretched to double their length, let them be released,
1,Up the cliff they rode, back and forth, and at every stage discovered instruments of defense: embrasures, traps, stone-tumbles, timbers pivoted to sweep the intruder into space, sally-ports and trip-holes.
1,bluffs extend into the valley, with little more than an arrow-flight between. They are riddled with tunnels; were you to march past a hail of arrows would strike down and in one minute you would lose a thousand men
1,the Wastes of Falax
1,the Flesh Cape of Miscus
1,the Totness Squalings
1,A great gibbet was erected, with the arm sixty feet from the ground
1,the activating spell is of three resonances and a quaver
1, a dour old castle of fourteen towers overlooking the harbor
1,"You refer to the Temple of Atlante?…The priests claim that the number of steps above the surface is dwindling: either the land is sinking or the sea is rising: such is their reasoning
1,Trilda had been designed by Hilario, a minor magician of many quaint notions, and built overnight by a band of goblin carpenters who took their pay in cheeses.
1, a wonderful structure of jet and milk-glass. Slender columns supported domes and tall arcades and higher domes, and still more, ranked one above the other, along with a hundred terraces and balconies and, higher yet, a cluster of towers flying pennons and banderoles. In the shadowed halls hung chandeliers encrusted with diamonds and moonstones, which gave off glints of red, blue, green and purple light.
1,the Cam Brakes. This is a series of ledges or terraces arranged like steps, which, according to myth, the giant Cam laid out to ease his way from Lake Quyvem up to the moors.
1,ancient tombs; give them all due respect. This place was sacred to the ancient Rhe-daspians, who inhabited the land three thousand years ago. Ghosts are common, and it is said that sometimes old friendships are renewed and old antagonisms find vent. If you by chance see such ghosts, make no sound and give no interference, and above all, never agree to act as arbiter at one
1,When you come to Lake Quyvern, you will discover Kernuun's Antler, which is the inn of Dildahl the Druid. He is, so it seems, a kindly man, and offers a hospitality of moderate cost. This is hardly true and you must eat none of his fish! He will serve it in many guises: as roe, and croquettes, and pickles, and pudding, and in soup. Eat only the items whose cost is specified
;lyonesse encounter
1,Loald, a submarine giant
1,eery knight Sir Sacrontine who could not sleep of nights until he had killed a Christian
1,the crone named Dyldra, who was profound in the lore of herbs, and by some considered a witch
1,Ewaldo Idra, Adept of the Caucasian Mysteries.
1,Queen Sollace showed great cordiality to religious zealots and priests, and found much of interest in their creeds. She was thought to be sexually cold and never took lovers.
1,Dame Boudetta, Mistress of the Household, a severe and uncompromising lady, born into the petty gentility. Her duties were manifold: she supervised the female servants, monitored their virtue, arbitrated questions of propriety. She knew the special conventions of the palace. She was a compendium of genealogical information and even greater masses of scandal.
1,Prince Quilcy, is feeble-minded and spends his days playing with fanciful dolls and doll-houses.
1,King Oriante, a pallid round-headed little man, was ineffectual, shrill and waspish. He reigned at his castle Sfan Sfeg, near the town Oaldes, but could not rule the fiercely independent barons of mountain and moor. His queen, Behus, was both tall and corpulent and she had borne him a single son, Quilcy, now five years old, somewhat lack-witted and unable to control the flow of saliva from his mouth.
1,four gaunt Druid priests. They wore long robes of brown furze, belted and hooded to hide their faces, and each carried an oak branch from their sacred grove.
1,…a pair of young mermaids. They had seen her and called out, but they used a slow strange language Suldrun could not understand. Their olive-green hair hung about their pale shoulders; their lips and the nipples of their breasts were also a pale green. One waved and Suldrun saw the webbing between her fingers. Both turned and looked offshore to where a bearded merman reared from the waves. He called out in a hoarse windy voice
1,King Casmir now dispatched a secret emissary to Dascinet, urging attack upon Troicinet, and promising full assistance.
1,…green glass bottle of a size to hold a gallon. The mouth fitted tightly about the neck of a double-headed homunculus, so that only its two small heads protruded. These were squat, no larger than cat-size, with wrinkled bald pates, snapping black eyes, a nose and oral apparatus of tough brown horn. The body was obscured by the glass and a dark liquid, like strong beer…"Let the bottled imps clamp your hair or your fingers and you will learn the meaning of harm."
1,The surface of the mirror moved; for an instant a face looked into her own: a man's face. Dark hair curled down past a flawless complexion; fine eyebrows curved over lustrous dark eyes; a straight nose complemented a full supple mouth.. .The magic faded…From time to time I demonstrate the inconceivable, or mock the innocent, or give truth to liars, or shred the poses of virtue—all as perversity strikes me. now I am silent; this is my mood."
1,…trained animals, which King Casmir had ordained for his pleasure. Bears in blue cocked hats tossed balls back and forth; four wolves in costumes of pink and yellow satin danced a quadrille; six herons with as many crows marched in formation.
1,…a weird-woman dressed in white entered the chamber holding high a glass vessel which exuded a flux of colors swirling behind her like smoke
1,…Brother Umphred, a portly round-faced evangelist, originally from Aquitania
1,…the Skyls, a dark crafty race of unknown origin, were uncontrollable. They lived isolated in mountain glens, emerging only when the time came for dreadful deeds. Vendetta, revenge and counter-revenge ruled their lives. The Skyls' virtues were stealth, reckless elan, blood-lust and stoicism under torment; his word, be it promise, guarantee or threat might be equated with certainty; indeed the Skyl's exact adherence to his pledge often verged upon the absurd. From birth to death his life was a succession of murders, captivities, escapes, wild flights, daring rescues: deeds incongruous in a landscape of Arcadian beauty.
1,A cavalcade of twenty knights and men-at-arms came down the Sfer Arct and into Lyonesse Town. At their head rode Duke Carfilhiot, erect and easy: a man with black curling hair cropped at his ears, a fair skin, features regular and fine, if somewhat austere, save for the mouth, which was that of a sentimental poet.
1,A great lummox claims that you have molested his wife; he takes up his cutlass and comes at you.
1,Pomperol is an ardent ornithologist
1,swan-headed barge, which a dozen young girls clad in white feathers propelled slowly across the lake.
1,They breed and train the cannibal falcons, each a traitor to his kind.
1,a tall shape muffled in a long black cape, with a wide-brimmed black hat obscuring his features. He stood always back in the shadows and never spoke; when one or another of the magicians chanced to look into his face they saw black emptiness with a pair of far stars where his eyes might be.
1,Sartzanek, perhaps the most capricious and unpredictable of all the magicians, resided at Faroli, deep inside the forest,
1,a plague of maggots
1,She appeared to him as a female clothed with a soft pelt of black fur and an oddly beautiful cat-like mask. This creature knew a thousand lascivious tricks
1,imps riding like knights on armored herons
1,a young harpy in a cage.
1,Desmei moved away. Presently she departed through the forest in a palanquin carried by six running shadows.
1,Over a time of two hours she worked a great spell to sunder herself into a plasm which entered a vessel of three vents. The plasm churned, distilled, and emerged by the vents, to coalesce into three forms. The first was a maiden…
1,I am a student of magic. I am taught by the great Tamurello, and I am under obligation, so that I must refer to him matters of policy.
1,fairies of Tuddifot Shee, at the opposite end of Lally Meadow, who loved music, though no doubt for the wrong reasons.
1,Fairy musicians, discovering that a human passerby had chanced to hear them, invariably inquired how he had enjoyed the music, and woe betide the graceless churl who spoke his mind, for then he was set to dancing for a period comprising a week, a day, an hour, a minute and a second, without pause. However, should the listener declare himself enraptured he might well be rewarded by the vain and gloating halfling.
1,On certain occasions fairy horn-players asked to play along with him; each time Shimrod made polite refusal; if he allowed such a duet he might find himself playing forever: by day, by night, across the meadow, in the treetops, higgledy-piggledy through thorn and thicket, across the moors, underground in the shees. The secret, so Shimrod knew, was never to accept the fairies' terms, but always to close the deal on one's own stipulations, otherwise the bargain was sure to turn sour.
1,To the side a long-bearded troll, with an extravagantly large cudgel, beat a lank furry creature hanging like a rug on a line between a pair of trees. With every blow the creature cried out for mercy: Stop! No more! You are breaking my bones! Have you no pity? You have mistaken me; this is clear! My name is Grofinet! No more! Use logic and reason!"
1,*Boab*, who used the semblance of a pale green youth with grasshopper wings and antennae. He carried a black quill pen plucked from the tail of a raven and recorded all the events and transactions of the tribe on sheets pressed from lily petals.
1,TUTTERWIT: an imp who liked to visit human houses and tease the cats. He also liked to peer through windows, moaning and grimacing until someone's attention was engaged, then jerk quickly from sight.
1,GUNDELINE: a slender maiden of enchanting charm, with flowing lavender hair and green fingernails. She mimed, preened, cut capers, but never spoke, and no one knew her well. She licked saffron from poppy pistils with quick darts of her pointed green tongue.
1,WONE: she liked to rise early, before dawn, and flavor dew drops with assorted flower nectars.
1,MURDOCK: a fat brown goblin who tanned mouseskins and wove the down of baby owls into soft gray blankets for fairy children.
1,FLINK: who forged fairy swords, using techniques of antique force. He was a great braggart and often sang the ballad celebrating the famous duel he had fought with the goblin Dangott.
1,SHIMMIR: audaciously she had mocked Queen Bossum and capered silently behind her, mimicking the queen's flouncing gait, while all the fairies sat hunched, hands pressed to mouths, to stop their laughter. In punishment Queen Bossum turned her feet backward and put a carbuncle on her nose.
1,FALAEL: who manifested himself as a pale brown imp, with the body of a boy and the face of a girl. Falael was incessantly mischievous, and when villagers came to the forest to gather berries and nuts, it was usually Falael who caused their nuts to explode and transformed their strawberries to toads and beetles.
1,Twisk, who usually appeared as an orange-haired maiden wearing a gown of gray gauze.
1,The troll Mangeon
1,He marshaled two armies of mice and dressed them in splendid uniforms. The first army wore red and gold; the second wore blue and white with silver helmets. They marched bravely upon each other from opposite sides of the meadow and fought a great battle
1,He assembled an orchestra of hedgehogs, weasels, crows and lizards and trained them in the use of musical instruments.
1,a troll, with a narrow forehead and a great red nose from which sprouted a mustache of nose-hairs. He carried a net and a wooden pitchfork.
1,a furious troll, wearing purple fustian. He was even more ugly than the previous troll, with warts and wens protruding from his forehead, which hung like a crag over a little red nose with the nostrils turned forward.
1,a troll who seemed to combine all the repulsive aspects of the first two. He wore snuff-brown garments, black boots with iron buckles and an odd conical hat tilted to one side.
1,an ogre, rocking from side to side on heavy bowed legs. He stood fifteen feet tall; his arms and torso, like his legs, were knotted with wads of muscle! His belly thrust forward in a paunch. A great crush hat sheltered a gray face of surpassing ugliness. On his back he carried a wicker basket containing a pair of children.
1, a witch trapped me under her hat and sold me
1,the ghosts of dead children running along the' roof.
1,One of the dryads splashed water toward Dhrun. He saw the drops rise into the air and sparkle in the sunlight, whereupon they became small golden bees, which darted into Dhrun's eyes and buzzed in circles, blotting out his sight.
1,Dame Melissa, as she calls herself, is a dire witch. When I was fifteen years old, she gave me drugged milk to drink, then transferred herself into my body—that which she wears today. I, a fifteen-year-old girl, was housed in the body Melissa had been using:
1,Rhodion, king of all fairies, who wears a green hat with a red feather. Take his hat and he must do your bidding
1,Pilbane the Dancer, who robbed along the highway for thirteen years
1, the great Janton Throatcut himself. Only last week I hanged high his six henchmen. He was in the act of taking their shoes for his collection; he does not care a fig for clothes."
1,the Thief-Taker
1,DOCTOR FIDELIUS
1,Grand gnostic, seer, magician.
1,HEALER OF SORE KNEES
1,a pair of bearded gryphs. Give each a comb of honey coming and going, which you have brought for the purpose.
1,Fafhadiste and his three-legged blue goat
1,acrobats, contortionists, mimes and jugglers
1,a team of two-headed black horses, of great size and strength
1,I am a magician of the eleventh level," said Shimrod
1,A band of fifteen ragged mendicants straggled south
1,Carfilhiot gave a hiss of exasperation; tonight the sandestin was restless and frolicsome. He seized the great red nose, twisted and kneaded it to the form of a crude and lumpy ear, which squirmed under his fingers to become a lank green foot. Carfilhiot used both hands to cope with the object and again produced an ear, into which he uttered a sharp command:
1,Princess Madouc, half-fairy, is a long-legged urchin with dark curls and a face of fascinating mobility.
1, the trolls of Komin Beg to war, in which they are led by a ferocious imp named Dardelloy.
1,three one-legged witches: Cuch, Gadish and Fehor
1,A boy or girl innocently trespassing upon a fairy meadow might be cruelly whipped with hazel twigs
1,VISBHUME, apprentice to the recently dead Hippolito, applied to the sorcerer Tamurello for a similar post, but was denied.
1,a young witch named Zanice, accused of drying the udders of her neighbor's cow.
1,each year the Esq magicians alter a hundred human fetuses, hoping that one may be born with thirteen eyes in a circlet around its forehead…So far, nine eyes is their limit of capability, and these become priests of the cult
1,a Circassian witch who began to corrode Tamurello with Blue Ruin
1,Sandestin: a class of halfling which wizards employ to work their purposes. Many magical spells are effected through the force of a sandestin.
1,he cursed the witch with footlong toenails, so that now and forever she must wear special boots."
1,the wizard Baibalides, who lived in a house of black rock on Lamneth Isle, a hundred yards off the coast of Wysrod
1,falloy: a variety of halfling. much like a fairy, but larger and far more gentle of disposition.
1, a druid appeared in a brown robe with a sprig of mistletoe pinned to his hood. He uttered a single word; all fell silent, then slunk away and hid in the shadows.
1,Hoonch the dog-god
1,iron-legged goat
1,crayfish in the shallow pools and a noble trout lazing in the shadows

1,a ghoul who has the power to change his guise. It will meet you in sweet friendship, and offer wine and food and kindly shelter.

1,A gallstone cast by the ogre Heulamides gave off a peculiar stench.

1,took a black box from the shelf, poured inside a gill of water, added drops of a glowing yellow liquid which caused the water to show films of light at various levels.

The third ball from the center was accompanied by a smaller ball and made its circuit in exactly one year

In its belly_treasure_sack is a magical Brass Shovel 1d6+2 (no other effects), a magical Shield emblazoned with the image of Itztli (gives 1 point of damage reduction to melee/ranged attacks, Cleric or Fighter only), and a Wand of Metal Attraction (once a day the wielder can activate the wand to pull a single metal object to him from up to 30 feet away, effect lasts as long as the wielder concentrates. If the object is held by an uncooperative party an opposed strength check at +4 is made, failure ends the effect)

1,*Black Tar Pits*.  Pitch Elementals have been known to spawn here.

1,BARNACLE GEESE. Wrecked ships covered with barnacles that hatch into geese. Children with small, sharp knives collecting the embryonic geese. They are valuable as delicacies, but you have to be small and nimble to crawl around the wrecks without cutting yourself on the shells. 
1,BRENDAN’S ISLAND. Monastery of St. Brendan the Navigator, discoverer of the continent of Faerie. The cheerful monks brew excellent beer and love to wrestle. St. Brendan’s grave is sited on a phantom island, just offshore, which only exists for people who are blind drunk. He was buried with a compass that always points to the heart’s desire of its bearer. It is guarded by an ancient dwarf with a quarterstaff, immensely strong and sullen, who will bash in the head of anyone who tries to take it. Also if you sober up while you’re on the island it vanishes and you fall into the sea. 
1,EASTMARCH. Castle built on a tidal island, only accessible at low tide. The Lord of [direction]march despises women. He keeps marrying new brides, accusing them of unchastity and confining them to the cells beneath the castle, which flood at high tide. They drown when they get tired of paddling to keep their heads above water. The fish carry their bodies away to the sunken glass city of Ys, where the enchantress Dahut places their bodies in a green glass cauldron full of bubbling black smoke and reanimates them as fishwives. The fishwives are gilled, translucent, beautiful, equipped with needle-sharp teeth and claws. Dahut is the same, only morbidly obese. She feasts on the flesh of sailors and is trying to figure out how to raise Ys back to the surface.
1,BEACHED SERPENT. Beached, dying sea serpent. Fishermen and circling swamp gryphons (vulturous, oily, love games) sharing an uneasy truce - there’s enough meat here for everyone, though until it actually dies nobody dares get too close to it. Pearlescent scales are mildly valuable and scuffles are already breaking out over who should get to claim them.
1,CROWN AND PEARL. Fishing village on stilts. A favoured trawling spot is the sunken city of Ys, whose glass towers still protrude above the waves at low tide. Sometimes at sunset you can see them glinting from the shore. The local priest has forbidden anyone to fish near the towers after Huw brought a fishwife (a beautiful, translucent monster woman) home in his nets - he announced he was going to marry her, but a couple of days later she carved out his guts with her claws and slipped away. The lads down at the pub, the Crown and Pearl, have been daring each other to go back and catch themselves another wife - they say she’ll fall in love with you if you treat her better than Huw did.
1,SWAMP GRYPHONS. Nest of 2d4 swamp gryphons - oily black feathers, bald vulture head, mangy lynx body, voiced by Jeremy Irons. They love games, and one is playing chess with a captured priest.
1,BIRD NUNS. Huge colony of nesting seabirds - terns, shearwaters, guillemots, razorbills and puffins. Saint Milburga spent thirteen years living among the birds, tending and preaching to them. Today, nuns in guano-spattered habits carry on her good works. The nunnery has high stone walls to prevent dissatisfied novices from running away, and anyone who gets caught is sentenced by the abbess to shovel guano until she has learnt humility. This has not stopped a headstrong merchant’s daughter from concocting an elaborate plan to escape into the woods and become a witch. The gardener is a petty thief, on the run from the law, pretending to be a mute and harmless fool. All the nuns secretly have sex with him. 
1,FETCHES. Exact duplicates of the PCs. Have all the PCs’ gear and memories. Suspect the PCs of being fetches - doppelgangers created by some enchanter or faerie. At sunrise a fetch will crumble to dust unless it has killed the person it imitates - everyone knows this.
1,DOBHARS. A pack of 6d6 dobhars - half-dog, half-otter, all sinuosity and teeth. The adults are teaching the adorable babies how to swim and dive for clams. Their pelts are valuable and if they’re caught young they can be raised as pets, though never fully tamed. The den is nearby - tunnels in a bank of mud.
1,RAIDED TOWN. Town on a flat tidal island, flooded, burning and ruined. The stone walls that were supposed to keep out the water at high tide have been broken by the orks. A couple of terrified peasants have been left stranded on rooftops and attics. A handful of orks patrol the submerged streets, looking for the last remaining scraps of loot or flesh. Their leader rides a mereswine (tusked porpoise) and has a necklace of human ears.
1,HUNGRY WOMAN. An emaciated, pot-bellied woman, a refugee from the town, who in her desperation ate a patch of starvegrass. She is now cursed to be hungry forever, although she can never die of starvation. Eating enough food for a hundred men in a single sitting will dispel the curse.
1,SELKIES. 2d4 short hobbitlike people squatting on a beach, roasting clams over a firepit. One is playing a flute. Empty sealskins lie on the sand nearby. These are selkies, and they’ve shed their skins to come ashore - if you steal their skins they’ll have to be your slaves, but the rest of their clan will try to rescue them. They are cunning and efficient rogues and they do not forget a grudge.
1,FLOODED GROVE. Mereswine (tusked porpoises) snapping at birds in the branches of a flooded grove of oak trees. They belong to a couple of orks sitting on a fallen, half-submerged menhir, who are taking bets on whether they’ll succeed. The orks are not in a mood to fight but they won’t back down in front of each other. 
1,SEDGE NYMPHS. Village overrun with hungry, carnivorous toads. Most adults fled or dead, some children surviving in branches of tall tree. Close by, a stagnant lake - the nymphs who live in the slimy water have sent the plague of toads to punish a child who dared to steal their polliwogs.
1,SAFE HARBOUR. Fishing village on stilts. Pub called the Safe Harbour serves pale, salty marsh ale brewed from mushrooms. Effects sneak up on the drinker - five pints have almost no effect, six knock you out. The villagers have cut a secret deal with the orks of Neptune - they set false lights to wreck ships, and deliver them kidnapped travellers, in exchange for being left alone. If the PCs get drunk and pass out they’ll wake up in the slave corral. A hedge wizard has been living for the last six months in a hut just outside town - he doesn’t drink alcohol and has no idea all this is going on. He’s studying the anaesthetic properties of the local fungus.
