# Contributing to Hex Describe

The simplest way to contribute is to contribute new libraries!

If you have suggestions for the documentation, or code changes, feel
free to contact me by mail: [alex@gnu.org](mailto:alex@gnu.org), or
take a look at the
[alternatives](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact).

I prefer pulling changes from public git repositories, no matter where
they are hosted, but [patches via email](https://git-send-email.io/),
or [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/kensanata/hex-describe)
work as well.

As for issues, your options are:

* just send an email (this is the best!)

* send a patch for the `TODO` file

* create an issue [on CPAN](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Game-HexDescribe)

* create an issue [on my Software Wiki](https://alexschroeder.ch/software/Text_Mapper)

* create an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/kensanata/hex-describe/issues)

## User visible changes

Make sure you update the Changes file. It’s the first thing people see
[on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/dist/Game-HexDescribe).

## Commit messages

Use the [packaging] tag to indicate changes that package maintainers
must know about.

## Code of conduct

Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights):
