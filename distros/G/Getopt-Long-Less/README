DESCRIPTION

    This module is a reimplementation of Getopt::Long, with less
    features/configurability. Only the subset which I'm currently using
    (which I think already serves a lot of common use cases for a lot of
    people too) is implemented.

    Only three functions are implemented: GetOptions, GetOptionsFromArray,
    and Configure.

    No configuring from use statement. No OO interface.

    Much much less modes/configuration. No support for POSIXLY_CORRECT. We
    always do bundling (this is not Getopt::Long's default), we never
    ignore case (this is not Getopt::Long's default), we always permute, we
    always autoabbreviate, we always do GNU compatibility (allow --opt=VAL
    in addition to --opt VAL including allowing --opt=), we never do
    getopt_compat. Basically currently there's no mode you can configure
    (although pass_through might be added in the future).

    No autoversion, no autohelp. No support to configure prefix pattern.

    Currently no support for arrayref handler (e.g. "foo=s" => \@ary). No
    support for array desttype ('foo=s@' => ...).

    Also, this module requires 5.010.

    So what's good about this module? Slightly less compile time overhead,
    due to less code. This should not matter for most people. I just like
    squeezing out milliseconds from startup overhead of my CLI scripts.
    That's it :-)

    Sample startup overhead benchmark:

    # COMMAND: perl devscripts/bench-startup 2>&1
