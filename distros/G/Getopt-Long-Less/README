NAME
    Getopt::Long::Less - Like Getopt::Long, but with less features

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.090 of Getopt::Long::Less (from Perl
    distribution Getopt-Long-Less), released on 2019-02-02.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a reimplementation of Getopt::Long, with less
    features/configurability. Only the subset which I'm currently using
    (which I think already serves a lot of common use cases for a lot of
    people too) is implemented.

    Only three functions are implemented: GetOptions, GetOptionsFromArray,
    and Configure.

    No configuring from "use" statement. No OO interface.

    Much much less modes/configuration. No support for POSIXLY_CORRECT. We
    always do bundling (*this is not Getopt::Long's default*), we never
    ignore case (*this is not Getopt::Long's default*), we always permute,
    we always autoabbreviate, we always do GNU compatibility (allow
    "--opt=VAL" in addition to "--opt VAL" including allowing "--opt="), we
    never do getopt_compat. Basically currently there's no mode you can
    configure (although pass_through might be added in the future).

    No autoversion, no autohelp. No support to configure prefix pattern.

    No support for GetOptions' "hash storage mode" (where the first argument
    is a hashref) nor "classic mode" (where destination is not explicitly
    specified). Basically, the arguments need to be pairs of option
    specifications and destinations.

    Currently no support for arrayref destination (e.g. ""foo=s" => \@ary").
    No support for array desttype ("'foo=s@' => ...").

    Also, this module requires 5.010.

    So what's good about this module? Slightly less compile time overhead,
    due to less code. This should not matter for most people. I just like
    squeezing out milliseconds from startup overhead of my CLI scripts.
    That's it :-)
