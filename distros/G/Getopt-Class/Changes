Revision history for Perl module Getopt::Class

0.1 2020-04-27
    - Initial version 0.1
0.1.1 2020-04-27
    - Corrected 2 typos overlooked and updated slightly the documentation
0.101.0 2020-04-27
    - Change of versioning, cpan forcing me to set version to higher than 0.100.0
0.101.1 2020-05-01
    - Corrected a type in method class
0.102.0 2020-05-02
    - Improvement in management of aliases so that when an alias value is modified, it also modifies the values for other aliases
    - Created an inline class so that the resulting options can be called as method, e.g.
    my $cl = Getlong::Class->new({ dictionary => $dict });
    my $opts = $ct->exec;
    printf( "Name provided is: %s\n", $opts->name );
    # or
    printf( "Name provided is: %s\n", $opts->{name} );
    - Corrected and improved aliases using Tie::Hash, because the perl feature https://metacpan.org/pod/perlref#Assigning-to-References refaliasing is still experimental and using Tie::Hash is more straightforward
    - Added the access of the option values as object method, each with their type being an object (string, boolean, date/datetime, number, hash or array reference)
0.102.1 2020-05-05
    - Corrected design bug for option key aliases not working properly.

    - Bug fixes and design improvements
0.102.3 2020-05-21
	- Change from TryCatch to Nice::Try because TryCatch got broken with release of Devel::Declare version 0.006020
