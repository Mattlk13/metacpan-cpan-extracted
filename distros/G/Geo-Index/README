Geo::Index allows the creation of in-memory geographic indices of sets of 
points.  Once an index has been created one can run fast searches against 
the index.  The module supports search by distance, by bounding box and 
by proximity.

While by default computations are done for the Earth, other bodies can be 
used by supplying appropriates radii and circumferences.
