    Getopt::Long

    Getopt::Long::Spec, which can also parse Getopt::Long spec into hash as
    well as transform back the hash to Getopt::Long spec. OO interface. I
    should've found this module first before writing my own
    parse_getopt_long_opt_spec(). But at least currently
    parse_getopt_long_opt_spec() is at least about 30-100+% faster than
    Getopt::Long::Spec::Parser, has a much simpler implementation (a single
    regex match), and can handle valid Getopt::Long specs that
    Getopt::Long::Spec::Parser fails to parse, e.g. foo|f=s@.
