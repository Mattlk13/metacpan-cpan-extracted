Game::Kezboard - a SDL game where cards are used to move around a board

This module can be installed using cpanm,

  cpanm Game::Kezboard

though on some systems it may be better to first install SDL via the
ports or package system, e.g. on OpenBSD 7.4:

  doas pkg_add p5-SDL
  # ... setup local::lib and App::cpanminus here ...
  cpanm Game::Kezboard


Run perldoc(1) on Game::Kezboard for documentation, or run "kezboard" in
a terminal to start the game. It's a SDL game, so it may help to have
something like X11 available.


To author a new release:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make && make test && make dist
  cpanm Game-Kezboard-*.tar.gz
  kezboard                            # does it actually start?
  git tag v...
  cpan-upload ...
  git push ...
  make realclean

kezboard can be run in-place via something like:

  perl kezboard --prefix=data --level=6
