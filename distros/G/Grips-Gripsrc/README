SYNOPSIS

	($id, $user, $pwd) = $mach->iup;

DESCRIPTION
    "Grips::Gripsrc" is a class implementing a simple interface to the
    .gripsrc file used as by the ftp program.

    "Grips::Gripsrc" also implements security checks just like the ftp
    program, these checks are, first that the .gripsrc file must be owned by
    the id and second the ownership permissions should be such that only the
    owner has read and write access. If these conditions are not met then a
    warning is output and the .gripsrc file is not read.

THE .gripsrc FILE
    The .gripsrc file contains id and initialization information used by the
    auto-login process. It resides in the user's home directory. The
    following tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs,
    or new-lines:

    host name
        Identify a remote host name. The auto-login process searches the
        .gripsrc file for a host token that matches the remote host
        specified. Once a match is made, the subsequent .gripsrc tokens are
        processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or an- other
        host or a default token is encountered.

    default
        This is the same as host name except that default matches any name.
        There can be only one default token, and it must be after all host
        tokens. This is normally used as:

            default id anonymous user id@site

        thereby giving the user automatic anonymous login to hosts not
        specified in .gripsrc.

    id name
        Identify a id on the remote host. If this token is present, the
        auto-login process will initiate a login using the specified name.

    user string
        Supply a password. If this token is present, the auto-login process
        will supply the specified string if the remote server requires a
        password as part of the login process.

    pwd string
        Supply an additional password. If this token is present, the
        auto-login process will supply the specified string if the remote
        server requires an additional password.

    macdef name
        Define a macro. "Grips::Gripsrc" only parses this field to be
        compatible with *ftp*.

CONSTRUCTOR
    The constructor for a "Grips::Gripsrc" object is not called new as it
    does not really create a new object. But instead is called "lookup" as
    this is essentially what it does.

    lookup ( HOST [, ID ])
        Lookup and return a reference to the entry for "HOST". If "ID" is
        given then the entry returned will have the given login. If "ID" is
        not given then the first entry in the .gripsrc file for "HOST" will
        be returned.

        If a matching entry cannot be found, and a default entry exists,
        then a reference to the default entry is returned.

METHODS
    id ()
        Return the id for the gripsrc entry

    user ()
        Return the user code for the gripsrc entry

    pwd ()
        Return the pwd information for the gripsrc entry

    iup ()
        Return a list of id, user and pwd information fir the gripsrc entry
