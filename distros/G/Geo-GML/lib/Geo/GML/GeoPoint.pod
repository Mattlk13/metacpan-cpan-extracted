 my $data;

=item $obj-E<gt>B<GPtoGML>($object, %options)

 -Option--Default
  srs     <from OBJECT>

=over 2

=item srs => SRS-name

Overrule the projection name as found in the Geo::Point object, which
is just a simple label.  Be sure that your $object is in the correct
projection, for instance via

   $gml->GPtoGML($gp->in('wgs84'), srs => 'EPGS:4326');
