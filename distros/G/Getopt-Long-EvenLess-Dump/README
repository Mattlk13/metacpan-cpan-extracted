NAME
    Getopt::Long::EvenLess::Dump - Run a Getopt::Long::EvenLess-based script
    but only to dump the spec

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Getopt::Long::EvenLess::Dump
    (from Perl distribution Getopt-Long-EvenLess-Dump), released on
    2017-08-10.

FUNCTIONS
  dump_getopt_long_evenless_script
    Usage:

     dump_getopt_long_evenless_script(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Run a Getopt::Long::EvenLess-based script but only to dump the spec.

    This function runs a CLI script that uses "Getopt::Long::EvenLess" but
    monkey-patches beforehand so that "run()" will dump the object and then
    exit. The goal is to get the object without actually running the script.

    This can be used to gather information about the script and then
    generate documentation about it or do other things (e.g.
    "App::shcompgen" to generate a completion script for the original
    script).

    CLI script needs to use "Getopt::Long::EvenLess". This is detected
    currently by a simple regex. If script is not detected as using
    "Getopt::Long::EvenLess", status 412 is returned.

    Will return the "Getopt::Long::EvenLess" specification.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename* => *str*

        Path to the script.

    *   libs => *array[str]*

        Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script.

    *   skip_detect => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  GETOPT_LONG_EVENLESS_DUMP => bool
    Will be set to 1 when executing the script to be dumped.
