NAME

    Graphics::Raylib - Perlish wrapper for Raylib videogame library

SYNOPSIS

        use Graphics::Raylib;
        use Graphics::Raylib::Text;
        use Graphics::Raylib::Color;
    
        my $g = Graphics::Raylib->window(120,20);
        $g->fps(5);
    
        my $text = Graphics::Raylib::Text->new(
            text => 'Hello World!',
            color => Graphics::Raylib::Color::DARKGRAY,
            size => 20,
        );
    
        while (!$g->exiting) {
            Graphics::Raylib::draw {
                $g->clear;
    
                $text->draw;
            };
        }

raylib

    raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA
    framework. Allegro and SDL have also been analyzed for reference.

    NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to learn
    videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no
    auto-debugging... just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way.

IMPLEMENTATION

    This is a Perlish wrapper around Graphics::Raylib::XS, but not yet
    feature complete.

    You can import Graphics::Raylib::XS for any functions not yet exposed
    perlishly.

METHODS/SUBS AND ARGUMENTS

    window($width, $height, $title)

      Constructs the Graphics::Raylib window. $title is optional and
      defaults to $0. Resources allocated for the window are freed when the
      handle returned by window goes out of scope.

    fps($fps)

      If $fps is supplied, sets the frame rate to that value. Returns the
      frame rate in both cases.

    clear($color)

      Clears the background to $color. $color defaults to
      Graphics::Raylib::Color::RAYWHITE.

    exiting()

      Returns true if user attempted exit.

    draw($coderef)

      Begins drawing, calls $coderef-()> and ends drawing. See examples.

EXAMPLES

    Conway's Game of Life

          my $HZ = 60;
          my $SIZE = 80;

          {
              my $bitmap = Graphics::Raylib::Shape->bitmap(
                  matrix => unpdl($gen),
                  color  => $rainbow->cycle,
              );
      
              Graphics::Raylib::draw {
                  $g->clear(Graphics::Raylib::Color::BLACK);
      
                  $text->{text} = "Generation " . ($i++);
                  $text->draw;
      
                  $bitmap->draw;
              };
      
      
              # replace every cell with a count of neighbours
              my $neighbourhood = zeroes $gen->dims;
              $neighbourhood += $_ for map { rotations } map {$_->transpose}
                                       map { rotations }      $gen->transpose;
      
              #  next gen are live cells with three neighbours or any with two
              my $next = $gen & ($neighbourhood == 4) | ($neighbourhood == 3);
      
              # procreate
              $gen = $next;
          }
