Geo::METARTAF decodes aviation METAR, SPECI, and TAF weather forecast 
code strings into English or, if you sub-class, some other language.


METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report), SPECI (Special METAR), and
TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) are ASCII strings containing codes
describing the weather at airports and weather bureaus around the world.

This module attempts to decode these reports into a form of English
that is (hopefully) more understandable than the reports themselves.

The decoded data is based on the Transport Canada AIM.

It is possible to sub-class the translation routines to enable
translation to other langauages.
