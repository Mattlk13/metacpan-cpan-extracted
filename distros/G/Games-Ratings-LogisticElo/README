Games-Ratings-LogisticElo version 0.001
===============================

Games-Ratings-LogisticElo provides methods to calculate Elo rating
changes. Unlike L<Games::Ratings::Chess::FIDE>, this Elo
implementation uses the logistic distribution instead of the standard
distribution.

Games-Ratings-LogisticElo can be used both for a single player who
played multiple rated games, and for a single competition with an
arbitrary number of players.
