NAME
    Graphics::ColorNamesLite - Define RGB values for common color names
    (lite version)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Graphics::ColorNamesLite (from
    Perl distribution Graphics-ColorNamesLite), released on 2024-05-06.

DESCRIPTION
    Graphics::ColorNamesLite is a light version of Graphics::ColorNames.
    Modules under "Graphics::ColorNamesLite::*" are only required to provide
    a package variable called $NAMES_RGB_TABLE which must contain a hashref
    mapping of color names and RGB values. RGB value is an integer (e.g.
    0x80ffff) and not a hexdigit string (e.g. "80ffff").

    Another package variable is optional: $NAMES_SUMMARIES_TABLE. It must
    contain a hashref mapping of color names to a short description string,
    e.g. "a darker red used for blah".

    No inheritance, no functional or OO interface is provided.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
