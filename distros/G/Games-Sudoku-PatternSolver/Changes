Changes for Games::Sudoku::PatternSolver

v0.07 2024/02/27

	Exchanged some exceptionally long lasting test puzzles in 03-games.t and added tests for solution counts.
	Small syntax changes to reduce required perl from 5.10.0 to 5.06.0.
	Changed the shebang in exe script from '/usr/bin/env perl' to just 'perl'. (Slaven Rezic)
	Renamed sudogen.pl to sudogen to make it look command-like.
	Examples for generator output usage (play, print) added to documentation.

v0.06 2024/02/24

	scripts/sudogen.pl added.
	Moved the PlayerIf into its own distribution Games::Sudoku::Html.
