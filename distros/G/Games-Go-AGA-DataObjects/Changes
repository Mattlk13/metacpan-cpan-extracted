Revision history for Perl extension Games::Go::AGA::DataObjects

0.152     2016-11-15 13:28:23-08:00 America/Los_Angeles
    A number of methods are now deprecated.  For example, keeping track of
    BYE players and calculating player statistics are now handled by the
    Tournament object instead of the Player.  The deprecation is managed by
    options to the 'use' directives.  Specifically, in order to actually
    deprecate the methods (which should result in more robust code), you
    must add a 'deprecate => <level>' option to the 'use' line.  See
    perldoc Games::Go::AGA::DataObjects for details.
