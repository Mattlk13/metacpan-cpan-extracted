========================

NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE

This module has been deprecated by the Gtk-Perl project.  This means that the
module will no longer be updated with security patches, bug fixes, or when
changes are made in the Perl ABI.  The Git repo for this module has been
archived (made read-only), it will no longer possible to submit new commits to
it.  You are more than welcome to ask about this module on the Gtk-Perl
mailing list, but our priorities going forward will be maintaining Gtk-Perl
modules that are supported and maintained upstream; this module is neither.

Since this module is licensed under the LGPL v2.1, you may also fork this
module, if you wish, but you will need to use a different name for it on CPAN,
and the Gtk-Perl team requests that you use your own resources (mailing list,
Git repos, bug trackers, etc.) to maintain your fork going forward.

Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the GtkSpell graphical user interface
library.  This module allows you to write perl applications that utilize the
GtkSpell library for mis-spelled word highlighting.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you encounter problems in the linking step of the build process, with an
error message similar to: '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpspell' the
gtkspell-2.0.pc file most likely needs to have the -lpspell changed to
-lpspell-compat or -laspell-pspell. Thus using the pspell compatibility
libraries of aspell.

To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl:$PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
