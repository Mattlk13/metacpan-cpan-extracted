This package contains Games-Go-AGA-TDListDB.

The American Go Association (AGA) provides a list of currently enrolled
players.  That list can be fetched from their website as a flat text file
from:

    https://www.usgo.org/ratings/TDListN.txt

This module (optionally) fetches that file (or any other file specified by
the caller), parses the information, and places it into a database (SQLite
by default, but could use others, such as MySQL).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following incantation

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command:
