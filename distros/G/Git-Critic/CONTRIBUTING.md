Contributing to projects can be confusing at times. Here are the guidelines I
recommend:

* I prefer to get pull requests rather than patches. Please do pull requests on branches.
* Please add an entry for each change in Changes as well.
* If it's a significant change, open an issue so we can discuss it.
