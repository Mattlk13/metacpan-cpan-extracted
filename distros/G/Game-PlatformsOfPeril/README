                       The Platforms of Peril

                    ############################

Platforms of Peril is a terminal-based game. Assuming App::cpanminus
(and possibly also local::lib) is installed and setup, in a suitable
terminal (possibly one with a square font such as White Rabbit and a
black background) install and run the game via:

  cpanm Game::PlatformsOfPeril
  pperil


There is some documentation about the game:

  perldoc Game::PlatformsOfPeril


For the source code, see:

https://thrig.me/src/Game-PlatformsOfPeril.git

This can be built and installed (with dependencies) by running:

  git clone https://thrig.me/src/Game-PlatformsOfPeril.git
  cd Game-PlatformsOfPeril
  cpanm File::ShareDir::Install
  cpanm .

or without dependencies the manual old fashioned way:

  perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

Level maps are ASCII files; these are installed to

  perl -MFile::ShareDir=:ALL -E 'say dist_dir q(Game-PlatformsOfPeril)'

or can be found in the git repository.

Run "perl pop" to test the game in this directory, or "perl pop 7" to
try out level 7, etc.

To author a new version:

  perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make dist
  cpanm Game-PlatformsOfPeril...
  pperil					# does it run once installed?
  git tag v...
  cpan-upload ...
  git push ...
  make realclean
