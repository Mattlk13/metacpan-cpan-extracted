NAME
    Getopt::Long::Dump - Run a Getopt::Long-based script but only to dump
    the spec

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.112 of Getopt::Long::Dump (from Perl
    distribution Getopt-Long-Dump), released on 2022-08-10.

FUNCTIONS
  dump_getopt_long_script
    Usage:

     dump_getopt_long_script(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Run a Getopt::Long-based script but only to dump the spec.

    This function runs a CLI script that uses "Getopt::Long" but
    monkey-patches beforehand so that "run()" will dump the object and then
    exit. The goal is to get the object without actually running the script.

    This can be used to gather information about the script and then
    generate documentation about it or do other things (e.g.
    "App::shcompgen" to generate a completion script for the original
    script).

    CLI script needs to use "Getopt::Long". This is detected currently by a
    simple regex. If script is not detected as using "Getopt::Long", status
    412 is returned.

    Will return the "Getopt::Long" specification.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename* => *str*

        Path to the script.

    *   libs => *array[str]*

        Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script.

    *   skip_detect => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

ENVIRONMENT
  GETOPT_LONG_DUMP => bool
    Will be set to 1 when executing the script to be dumped.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
