SYNOPSIS

    In lib/Your/Class.pm:

     package Your::Class;
     use Class::MaybeXSAccessor {
         accessors => [qw/foo bar/],
     };

    In code that uses your class:

     use Your::Class;
    
     my $obj = Your::Class->new;
     $obj->foo(1980);
     $obj->bar(12);

DESCRIPTION

    EARLY, EXPERIMENTAL.

    This module can be used to generate accessors/constructor. It will use
    Class::XSAccessor if available, falling back to Class::Accessor. Note
    that not all features from Class::Accessor nor Class::XSAccessor are
    supported.
