=head1 NAME

Code::Style::Kit::Parts - parts included in the distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Code::Style::Kit> distribution includes some parts that may be
useful in building your own kits.

I<NOTE>: this distribution does I<not> depend on the modules needed by
any of these parts (you may not want to use any of them), so you'll
need to explicitly depend on them in your own distributions.
