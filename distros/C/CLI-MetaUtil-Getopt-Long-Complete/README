    passing to Getopt::Long, it passes to Getopt::Long::Complete.

FUNCTIONS
  GetOptionsCLIWrapper
    Usage:

     GetOptionsCLIWrapper(%args) -> any

    Get options for a CLI wrapper.

    This routine can be used to get options for your CLI wrapper. For

    routine will let you collect all known "diff" options (declared in
    CLI::Meta::diff) while letting you add new options.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   add_opts => *hash*

    *   arg_completion => *code*

    *   cli* => *str*

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
