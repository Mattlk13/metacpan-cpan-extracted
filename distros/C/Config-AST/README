Config::AST
===========

This module aims to provide a generalized syntax tree implementation for
various configuration files. It does not implement parser for any existing
configuration file format. Instead, it provides an API that can be used by
parsers to build internal representation for the particular configuration
file format.

See the Config::Parser module for an implementation of a parser based on
this module.
