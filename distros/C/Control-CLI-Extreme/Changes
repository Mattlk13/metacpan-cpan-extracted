	* Method login() now will accept an empty password, for devices where no password is set but still prompt for

1.01	2018-09-02
	* Internal method discoverDevice(), used by login(), was failing to set the default prompt on "Generic"
	  non-Extreme device types which used either '$' or '?' as last character on their prompts
	* Added support for ISW (Extreme Networks industrial switch range)
	* Added non_recognized_login argument flag to both connect() and login() methods, which controls whether the
	  login() method should immediately return when an initial login output sequence is not recognized or whether
	  the method should keep trying to read login output until either a recognized login prompt is detected or
	  expiry of the timeout
	* Updates to error patterns
	* Added generic_login argument flag to both connect() and login() methods, which disables extended discovery
	  if it is desired to connect to non Extreme devices using this class
