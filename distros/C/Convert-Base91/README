Convert-Base91 version 0.001001
===============================

Base91 is a method for encoding binary data as printable ASCII
characters. Every two base91 characters (16 bits) encode 13 or 14 bits
of actual data, thus the overhead is between 14% and 23%, an
improvement over base64's overhead of 33%.

This module provides a procedural interface for encoding/decoding
whole strings and an OO interface for encoding/decoding in chunks.
