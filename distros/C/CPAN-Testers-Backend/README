CPAN::Testers::Backend

This distribution contains various backend scripts (inside runnable
modules) that process CPAN Testers data to support the APIs and website.

The runnable modules are all in the "CPAN::Testers::Backend::"
namespace, and are configured into executable tasks by Beam::Wire
configuration files located in "etc/container". The tasks are run using
Beam::Runner, which contains the beam command.
