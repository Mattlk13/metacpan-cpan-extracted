NAME

    Crypt::RC6 - Crypt::CBC compliant RC6 block cipher encryption module

SYNOPSIS

    use Crypt::RC6;
    
    my $cipher = new Crypt::RC6 $key;

    my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
    my $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION

    From THE RC6 BLOCK CIPHER, by Rivest, Robshaw, Sidney, and Yin...

    "RC6 is an evolutionary improvement of RC5, designed to meet the
    requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Like RC5,
    RC6 makes essential use of data-dependent rotations. New features
    of RC6 include the use of four working registers instead of two,
    and the inclusion of integer multiplication as an additional primitive
    operation. The use of multiplication greatly increases the diffusion
    achieved per round, allowing for greater security, fewer rounds, and
    increased throughput."

    This implementation requires the use of a 16-, 24-, or 32-byte key
    and 16-byte blocks for encryption/decryption. Twenty rounds are performed.
