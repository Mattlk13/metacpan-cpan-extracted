SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [InsertBlock::FromModule]

    In lib/Your/Module.pm (that wants to embed one or more routines):

     # INSERT_BLOCK: Code::Embeddable import
     # INSERT_BLOCK: Code::Embeddable another_func

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a collection of functions that can be embedded into
    another file's source code, e.g. using
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertBlock::FromModule (if you're using
    Dist::Zilla to build your dists).

    The functions put here are usually routines that are small,
    independent, and stable (doesn't change that much). Instead of
    require-ing a module that contains these routines, a client code can
    opt to embed them directly in its file instead. The advantage is less
    dependencies (no other module to depend on) and slightly smaller
    startup overhead. Compared to manual "copy-pasting" of code, embedding
    using Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertBlock::FromModule is more
    maintainable.

FUNCTIONS

 import

    A lightweight Exporter-style exporter. Supports @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK.
    No support for tags.

 pick(@list) => $item

    Pick a random item from a list. Will return undef if @ary is empty.

 pick_n($n, @list) => @items

    Pick $n items from a list.

 shuffle(@list) => @shuffled

    Just like List::Util's shuffle, except implemented in pure Perl and you
    don't have to load the module.

 uniq(@list) => @unique

    Just like List::MoreUtils's uniq, except implemented in pure Perl and
    you don't have to load the module.

ROUTINES

    These embeddable pieces of code are not function declaration:
