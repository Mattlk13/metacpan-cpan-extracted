NAME
    Crypt::OpenSSL::VerifyX509 - simple certificate verification

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::OpenSSL::VerifyX509;
      use Crypt::OpenSSL::X509;

      my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::VerifyX509->new('t/cacert.pem');

      my $cert = Crypt::OpenSSL::X509->new(...);
      $ca->verify($cert);

DESCRIPTION
    Given a CA certificate and another untrusted certificate, will show
    whether the CA signs the certificate. This is a useful thing to have if
    you're signing with X509 certificates, but outside of SSL.

    A specific example is where you're working with XML signatures, and need
    to verify that the signing certificate is valid.

    You could use Crypt::OpenSSL::CA to do this, but it is based on
    Inline::C, which can be troublesome in some situations. This module
    provides an XS alternative for the certificate verify feature.

METHODS
  new($ca_path)
    Constructor. Returns a VerifyX509 instance, set up with the given CA.

    Arguments:

     * $ca_path - path to a file containing the CA certificate

  verify($cert)
    Verify the certificate is signed by the CA. Returns true if so, and
    croaks with the verification error if not.

    Arguments:

     * $cert - a Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 object for the certificate to verify.
