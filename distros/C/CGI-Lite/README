CGI::Lite v3.03
---------------

Released: 6th May 2021

This is a new release of the 3.x branch. Please be aware of the API
changes from 2.x with particular reference to the deprecated and obsolete
subroutines and methods.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has only one dependency and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

These are the changes since the last general release (3.02).

Makefile.PL improved to CPAN Meta Spec 2 where available

Test suite enhanced: full coverage of add_timestamp()

DOC: Remove obsolete email addresses of contributors

META: Public repo is now at GitLab
