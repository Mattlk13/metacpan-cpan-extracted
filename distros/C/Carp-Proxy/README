Carp-Proxy

NAME
    Carp::Proxy - Diagnostic delegation

SYNOPSIS
    use Carp::Proxy;

    fatal 'handler_subroutine', @optional_arguments
        if not $assertion;

    sub handler_subroutine {
        my( $proxy_object, @optional_arguments ) = @_;

        $proxy_object->filled( 'explanation' );
        return;
    }

DESCRIPTION
    Carp::Proxy is a framework for throwing exceptions.  The goal is to
    couple the small lexical footprint of the die() statement with support
    for comprehensive error messages.  Good diagnostics pay for themselves;
    let's make them easier to produce.
