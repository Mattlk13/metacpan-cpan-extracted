NAME
    Cwalitee::Common - Common Cwalitee routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Cwalitee::Common (from Perl
    distribution Cwalitee-Common), released on 2021-06-06.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    What is cwalitee? Metric to attempt to gauge the quality of something.
    Since actual quality is hard to measure, this metric is called a
    "cwalitee" instead. The cwalitee concept follows "kwalitee" [1] which is
    specifically to measure the quality of CPAN distribution. I pick a
    different spelling to avoid confusion with kwalitee. And unlike
    kwalitee, the unqualified term "cwalitee" does not refer to a specific,
    particular subject. There can be "module abstract cwalitee" (which is
    handled by this module), "CPAN Changes cwalitee", and so on.

FUNCTIONS
  calc_cwalitee
    Usage:

     calc_cwalitee(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   code_fixup_r => *code*

    *   code_init_r* => *code*

    *   exclude_indicator => *array[str]*

        Do not use these indicators.

    *   exclude_indicator_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Do not use indicators from these modules.

    *   exclude_indicator_status => *array[str]*

        Do not use indicators having these statuses.

    *   include_indicator => *array[str]*

        Only use these indicators.

    *   include_indicator_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Only use indicators from these modules.

    *   include_indicator_status => *array[str]* (default: ["stable"])

        Only use indicators having these statuses.

    *   min_indicator_severity => *uint* (default: 1)

        Minimum indicator severity.

    *   prefix => *perl::modprefix* (default: "")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_cwalitee_indicators
    Usage:

     list_cwalitee_indicators(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   exclude => *array[str]*

        Exclude by name.

    *   exclude_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Exclude by module.

    *   exclude_status => *array[str]*

        Exclude by status.

    *   include => *array[str]*

        Include by name.

    *   include_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Include by module.

    *   include_status => *array[str]* (default: ["stable"])

        Include by status.

    *   max_severity => *int* (default: 5)

        Maximum severity.

    *   min_severity => *int* (default: 1)

        Minimum severity.

    *   prefix => *perl::modprefix* (default: "")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional

    Return value: (any)
