NAME
    CPAN::Meta::X - List of custom (x_*) keys in CPAN distribution metadata
    being used in the wild

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of CPAN::Meta::X (from Perl
    distribution CPAN-Meta-X), released on 2021-04-15.

DESCRIPTION
    The CPAN distribution metadata specification allows custom keys (those
    that begin with "x_" or "X_") to be added to the metadata. This document
    tries to catalog the custom keys that are being used by CPAN authors.

    In addition to custom metadata keys, this document also lists:

    *   custom phases and relationships in the prereqs hash that are being
        used by people

    *   custom keys in resources hash

LIST OF CUSTOM DISTRIBUTION METADATA KEYS
  x_Dist_Zilla key
    A big structure recording information related to Dist::Zilla which
    presumably is used to build the current distribution. Some of the things
    being put in here include: perl version used to build the distribution,
    Dist::Zilla plugins used to build the distribution, and so on.

  x_authority key
  x_contributors key
    List of contributors in a release.

    Examples:

    TBD

  x_examples key

  x_generated_by_perl key
  x_help_wanted key
  x_provides_scripts key
    List scripts that are being provided in the distribution. The structure
    is modelled after the standard provides hash.

    Examples:

    So say your distribution provides a "csv2json" script, your META.json
    would contain:

     "x_provides_scripts": {
       "csv2json": {
         "version": "0.1",
         "file": "bin/csv2json"
       }
     }

  x_spdx_expression key
  x_serialization_backend key
  x_static_install key
