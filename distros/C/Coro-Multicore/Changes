Revision history for Perl extension Coro::Multicore.

TODO: idle timeout, like IO::AIO
TODO: add examples

1.07  Tue Aug  3 16:12:02 CEST 2021
	- renew event pipe in an atfork handler, for limited fork support.
	- document the fact that AnyEvent is no longer initialised automatically.

1.06  Tue Dec 17 20:18:39 CET 2019
	- use separate stack when intiialising AnyEvent, to reduce the burden
          on callers of perlinterp_release ().

1.05  Mon Dec  9 04:11:44 CET 2019
	- mostly untested fix to make threaded perls work.

1.04  Tue Dec  3 08:11:28 CET 2019
	- autoload AnyEvent on demand only, which makes it easier
          to preload this module before fork'ing, as it no longer
          initialises AnyEvent when loaded, but only on first
          release.

1.03 Wed Mar  6 17:37:18 CET 2019
	- the recursioon check (disabled by default) wrongly triggered
          when multicore was completely _disabled_, instead of acting
          like a nop.

1.02 Tue Mar  5 13:31:03 CET 2019
	- make extra sanity checks configurable.
        - abort, not croak, when checks fail, as error is in XS code.
	- improve portability to non-gcc-compatible compilers, where perl falls
          back to a slow workaround that requires dTHX.
        - do not start first thread at module load, this is not required and
          potentially harmful with the current model.

1.01 Tue Aug 14 18:52:05 CEST 2018
	- attempt to port to strawberry perl, but it has too many broken functions
          (non-working malloc, overrides setjmp with nonexistant PerlProc_setjmp etc.).
	- do not require custom config for pthread on win32.
        - usleep on some bsds does not support a time > 1e6, so use sleep+usleep :/

1.0  Sun Aug 12 23:55:33 CEST 2018
	- bump to 1.0, works in production for me.
	- experimental fix for perl configs where JMPENV_JUMP requires THX.

0.03 Thu Jan 18 17:43:14 CET 2018
	- further USE_SOCKETS_AS_HANDLES fixes (Z59).
        - vastly improved documentation.
	- (experimental) catch exceptions and re-throw them.

0.02  Mon Jun 29 22:24:18 CEST 2015
	- actual first release, so experimental.

0.01  Thu Jun 25 16:04:51 CEST 2015
	- original version; cloned from AnyEvent::XSThreadPool.
