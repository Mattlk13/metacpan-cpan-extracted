NAME
    Carp::Source - Warn of errors with stack backtrace and source context

VERSION
    version 1.101420

SYNOPSIS
        use Carp::Source 'source_cluck';
        source_cluck 'some error';
        source_cluck 'some error',
            lines => 5, number => 0, color => 'yellow on_blue';

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports one function, "source_cluck()", which prints stack
    traces with source code extracts to make it obvious what has been called
    from where.

    It does not work for one-liners because there is no file from which to
    load source code.

FUNCTIONS
  source_cluck
        source_cluck 'some error';
        source_cluck 'some error',
            lines => 5, number => 0, color => 'yellow on_blue';

    Like Carp's "cluck()", but it also displays the source code context of
    all call frames, with three lines before and after each call being
    shown, and the call being highlighted.

    It takes as arguments a string (the error message) and a hash of
    options. The following options are recognized:

    "lines"
        Number of lines to display before and after the line reported in the
        stack trace. Defaults to 3.

    "number"
        Boolean value to indicate whether line numbers should be printed at
        the beginning of the context source code lines. Defaults to yes.

    "color"
        The color in which to print the source code line reported in the
        stack trace. It has to be a string that Term::ANSIColor understands.
        Defaults to "black on_yellow".

    This is just a quick hack - not all of "Carp"'s or even just "cluck()"'s
    features are present. The code borrows heavily from "Carp".
