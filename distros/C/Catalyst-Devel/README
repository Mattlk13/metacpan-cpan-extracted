NAME
    Catalyst::Devel - Catalyst Development Tools

DESCRIPTION
    The "Catalyst-Devel" distribution includes a variety of modules useful
    for the development of Catalyst applications, but not required to run
    them. This is intended to make it easier to deploy Catalyst apps. The
    runtime parts of Catalyst are now known as "Catalyst::Runtime".

    "Catalyst-Devel" includes the Catalyst::Helper system, which
    autogenerates scripts and tests; Module::Install::Catalyst, a
    Module::Install extension for Catalyst; and requirements for a variety
    of development-related modules. The documentation remains with
    Catalyst::Runtime.
