NAME
    Comparer::file_mtime - Compare file's mtime (modification time)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Comparer::file_mtime (from Perl
    distribution Comparer-file_mtime), released on 2024-09-19.

SYNOPSIS
     use Comparer::from_sortkey;

     my $cmp = Comparer::file_mtime::gen_comparer();
     my @sorted = sort { $cmp->($a,$b) } "newest", "old", "new";
     # => ("old","new","newest")

     # reverse
     $cmp = Comparer::file_mtime::gen_comparer(reverse => 1);
     @sorted = sort { $cmp->($a,$b) } "newest", "old", "new";
     # => ("newest","new","old")

    A real-world usage example (requires CLI sort-by-comparer from
    App::sort_by_comparer):

     # find directories named '*.git' that are newer than 7 days, and sort them by newest first
     % find -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '*.git' -mtime -7 | sort-by-comparer file_mtime -r

DESCRIPTION
    This comparer assumes the entries are filenames and will compare their
    modification time.

COMPARER ARGUMENTS
  follow_symlink
    Bool, default true. If set to false, will use lstat() function instead
    of the default stat().

  reverse
    Bool.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
