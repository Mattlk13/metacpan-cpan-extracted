Cisco-SNMP
==========

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

IMPORTANT NOTE

This is the new version of Cisco::Management.  This is a complete rewrite 
separating functions into sub classes allowing for quicker and easier 
development as well as allowing others to contribute to the 
Cisco::SNMP package.  

IPv6 VERSUS IPv4 ONLY

Cisco::SNMP supports IPv6 on systems with IPv6 configured but requires 
Socket version 1.94 or greater.  This may cause issues on Perl versions 
less than 5.14, where the default Socket module is of a lesser version.  
The requirement stems from the use of the getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() 
functions not available on older versions of Socket.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Socket (requires 1.94 for IPv6)
    Net::IPv6Addr (required for IPv6 support in ProxyPing)
  Sys::Hostname
  Net::SNMP
  Test::Simple
