      - Many bin\* script updates to separate functionality.
      - Changed @IPKEYS: IPAddress -> Addr, IPMask -> NetMask to match 
        OID names.
      - Removed access to *KEYS arrays directly; use accessors instead.
      - interface_ip() moved to C::M::IP->ip_info().

Was Cisco::Management prior to this.
