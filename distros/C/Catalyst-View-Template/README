Catalyst::View::Template

This is a Catalyst view class for the Template Toolkit with the following
design objectives:

* To be as close as possible to direct use of Template Toolkit

* To nevertheless integrate seamlessly with Catalyst

* To be easily augmented in behaviour by overriding or modifying methods

  Taken together with the other objectives, this should make it easy to
  repurpose for any view class in which you might want to use Template
  Toolkit templates.

This is a rethink of Catalyst::View::TT whose focus is on providing lots
of Catalyst-specific features on top of Template Toolkit, but which are
hard to augment without copy-pasting code from it, and which ultimately
only make templates harder to reuse or test in other contexts.
