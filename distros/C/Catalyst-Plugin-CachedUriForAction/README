Catalyst::Plugin::CachedUriForAction

This provides a (mostly) drop-in replacement version of "uri_for_action".

The stock Catalyst "uri_for_action" method is a thin wrapper around
"uri_for". Every time you pass "uri_for" an action to create a
parametrized URL for it, it introspects the dispatcher. This is
expensive, and on views that generate a lot of URLs, it can add up to a
substantial cost. Doing this introspection repeatedly can only possibly
be useful if the set of controllers and actions in the application can
change at runtime. Even then it is still wasted time on any view that
generates many URLs for the same action.

This plugin scans the dispatch table once during startup and pregenerates
templates for all possible output URLs. The only work then left in
"uri_for_action" is the string manipulation to assemble a URL from its
template.
