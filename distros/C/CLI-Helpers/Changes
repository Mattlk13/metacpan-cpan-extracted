    More optimizations for loading

    * Don't exec `git` when we're not running in a interactive environment *
    Adds `IO::Interactive` as a prereq * Make the input functions smart enough
    to know if we're using a

    terminal or not * Now that we use `IO::Interactive`, don't implement the
    readline

    monkey-patch as it's probably not required any longer * Recommend
    `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` as it provides a better feature set
