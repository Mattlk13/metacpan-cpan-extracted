NAME
    ColorThemeUtil::ANSI - Utility routines related to color themes and ANSI
    code

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of ColorThemeUtil::ANSI (from Perl
    distribution ColorThemeUtil-ANSI), released on 2021-02-06.

FUNCTIONS
  item_color_to_ansi
    Usage:

     my $ansi_code = item_color_to_ansi($color [ , $is_bg ]);

    This routine expects an item color (string or hash, see ColorTheme)
    returned by "get_item_color()" and converts it to ANSI code. This
    routine cannot handle coderef item color directly; so use
    "get_item_color()" first.

    If the item color has "ansi_fg" or "ansi_bg" property, this routine will
    use that directly. Otherwise, it will convert RGB to ANSI.
