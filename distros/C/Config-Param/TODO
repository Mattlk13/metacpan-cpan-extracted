=head1 POD script modificator

The POD generation should be able to append to the script it calls, also updating earlier POD to make things easier for me. Forgot to update paramorama POD for version 3.000004!

=head1 Update config files for advanced parameter definitions

The config files (and hence, paramorama) do not know anything about the
new features of parameter definitions that got added for interactive (command line) use.
If things should be a counter, etc., could be useful for parameter UIs derived from
the FileWorker. Right now, we are losing some semantics.

Need to decide on how to print flags, just numerical values or verbosely.

=head1 Consider supporting environment variables ...

perhaps ... in the form PROGRAM_PARNAME

=head1 Consider proper parameter groups

buntstift has tex.* parameters ... looks like a group, but is none. Do I need extra structure?

Perhaps all that's needed is in config files, mimicking INI-style grouping via

	=prefix tex.

(without or without dot ...)

That would prepend "tex." on all the following parameter names. Config::Param::print_file() could get some smarts to detect common prefixes. And done you are with pseudo-groups.

I could even add [tex.] as alias for that and, when avoiding here-document multiline strings and meta stuff, would have something that should parse as INI.

=head1 $config{hidenonshort}

consider providing a list of those instead ... or in addition, at least
