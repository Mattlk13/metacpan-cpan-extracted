Class::EHierarchy
=================

NOTICE:  One might wonder how we've jumped from 0.x releases to 2.x.  I've
decided to skip the 1.x releases to make it (hopefully) more obvious that
the API has changed and is not compatible with the 0.x series.  My fear was
that the average devmight see 0.x to 1.x and assume that I was simply
declaring the API stable.  While 2.x is a stable API it is not compatible
with 0.x.

Class::EHierarchy is intended to provide a base class for objects that
require both object and class hierarchal features.  For more information on
what that means, please see the POD.
