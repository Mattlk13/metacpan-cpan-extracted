CHANGELOG

v2.01 (2019/05/24)
==================
--Typos in documentation (Debian Perl Group)
--Conceiving a child would leave an errant object alive even
  if it failed initialization.  This is fixed.

v2.00 (2017/01/23)
==================
--Complete rewrite
--New API

v0.93 (2013/07/06)
==================
--Modified DESTROY method to call all superclass _deconstruct methods
  from the bottom up

v0.92 (2013/06/18)
==================
--Added more relationship methods
--Added alias functionality
--Updated & improved documentation
--Bumped minimum required perl to 5.8.3

v0.91 (2012/01/30)
==================
--Added automated loading of methods, properties, and default property
  values via class variables
--Fixed bug where every object created rewraps scoped methods in the 
  class symbol table
--Improved documentation with better examples and explanations

v0.90 (2011/08/18)
==================
--Completely rewritten into something (hopefully) more useful than the
  original incarnation.  Completely breaks old API and loses some
  functionality, while gaining some new functionality.  Possibly more
  congruent with the actual OOP concepts it claims to follow.

v0.06 (2003/03/18)
==================
--Old version.  Should be ashamed of itself.  May it die in obscurity.
