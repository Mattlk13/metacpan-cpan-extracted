Convert-Color-HUSL version 1.000
================================

HUSL is a human-friendly color space designed for perceptual
uniformity. HUSLp is a derivative of HUSL that also provides an
uniform chroma map at the expense of only including pastel
(desaturated) colors.

This distribution includes modules for dealing with the following
color spaces:

* CIE 1931 XYZ          :: Convert::Color::XYZ
* CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) :: Convert::Color::LUV
* CIE LCh               :: Convert::Color::LCh
* HUSL                  :: Convert::Color::HUSL
* HUSLp                 :: Convert::Color::HUSLp
