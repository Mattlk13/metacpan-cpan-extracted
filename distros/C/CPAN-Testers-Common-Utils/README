NAME
    CPAN::Testers::Common::Utils - Utility functions for CPAN Testers
    modules

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Testers::Common::Utils ':all';

        # NNTP ID <=> GUID mapping
        $guid    = nntp_to_guid( $nntp_id );
        $nntp_id = guid_to_nntp( $guid    );

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains common utility functions for use by other CPAN
    Testers modules

USAGE
  Mapping NNTP IDs to GUIDs
    Legacy CPAN Testers reports were sent via email and made available via
    an NNTP group, "perl.cpan.testers". Reports were 'indexed' by their NNTP
    ID. The next generation of CPAN Testers uses a GUID URN to identify
    reports.

    Old reports with an NNTP ID are mapped to GUIDs by replacing the first 8
    hex characters of a common 'base GUID' with a zero-padded decimal
    representation of the NNTP ID.

      XXXXXXXX-b19f-3f77-b713-d32bba55d77f

    Such GUID URNs are visually distinctive and have the nice feature of
    sorting earlier than second-generated report GUIDs based on a timestamp.

    Two translation functions are provided for convenience.

   nntp_to_guid
        $guid    = nntp_to_guid( $nntp_id );

    Given a numeric NNTP ID, returns a standard string-form GUID. (No range
    checking is done.) Examples:

      nntp_to_guid( 51432   );  # 00051432-b19f-3f77-b713-d32bba55d77f
      nntp_to_guid( 6171265 );  # 06171265-b19f-3f77-b713-d32bba55d77f

   guid_to_nntp
        $guid    = nntp_to_guid( $nntp_id );

    Given a GUID string of the form described above, returns the decimal
    number in the first 8 characters. Examples:

      guid_to_nntp( '00051432-b19f-3f77-b713-d32bba55d77f' ); # 51432
      guid_to_nntp( '06171265-b19f-3f77-b713-d32bba55d77f' ); # 6171265

    If the GUID string is not derived from the base GUID, this function
    returns "undef".
