CLI-LaTeX-Table

CLI-LatexTable

 A CLI command "latextable" is provided and also others are provided.

 Given the TSV formatted table
 such as copied region of an Excel worksheet or SQL output, you can
 easily get the LaTeX commands to produce same table even if it contains
 any alphabetical, numeral, symbolic characters unless they are ASCII or
 UTF-8. You can save a lot of time to draw tables by utilizing many
 option swithes for magnifying, rotating partly or totally, treating well
 on large numbers, hankaku-kana and so on.

PROVIDED COMMAND LINE INTERFACE programs : 
  
  1. latextable -- snippet generator from worksheet/scripts into LaTeX table/table-caption/text.
  2. transpose -- flips a matrix over its diagonal. Input is copied from Excel/SQL output and so on.
  3. saikoro -- random number/matrix generators of (various) uniform distributions.
  4. csel -- an command line interface to handle TSV/CSV files easier than cut/AWK commands.
  5. csv2tsv -- TSV formatter for regular CSV format files by Text::CSV_XS module.
  6. matrixpack -- transforms a TSV into different shaped matrix.

  All programs provides help-manual that is availble such as by "latextable --help". 
  If you want to see only "switch options", do "latextable --help opt(ions)". 
  If you want to see Japanese or English manual as you wish, do "latextable --help en" or "--help ja".


INSTALLATION

 The programs are provided in a form of Perl modules to
 be uploaded on CPAN. Each of the program is written
 as a single Perl program that works (almost) stand-alone.


 You can choose the way to install programs from the following
 plural ways.

1. Download and uncompress the file CLI-Contingency-Table-0.51.tar.gz
   from CPAN. Find the programs under the "scripts" directory
   inside it. Copy them into a directory whatever you like and you can
   (and call it "someWhere" in the next paragraph.)

   Then add that directory someWhere to the PATH environment
   variable (for either of Windows or Unix-like environments).
   If you use bash or zsh, add a line like the following
   into to  .bash_profile or .zshrc respectively, to use the
   program files provided in this module always you login,
   with the minimum affect to your computer environment
   (in the follwoing someWhere should be in abosolute path
   or "~/myScripts" ) :

      source someWhere/init.sh

2. If you like "Build" methot to install CPAN modules,
   run the following commands after uncompressing:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

3. You can also install the programs by the following simpler steps:

    cpan CLI::LaTeX::Table

   or

    cpanm CLI::LaTeX::Table

   The above requires your knowledge/understanding of
   the prepation of using the commands of 'cpan' or 'cpanm'
   and administrative rights on your computer to install
   programs (root privileges).

   This optional installaion way (3.) is written here because
   the author of the programs just want to explain that
   the programs provided are uploaded to CPAN can work
   in a kind of standard way.
