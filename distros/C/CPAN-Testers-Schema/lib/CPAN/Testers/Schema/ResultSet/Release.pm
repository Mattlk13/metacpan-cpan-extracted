=head1 VERSION

version 0.026

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rs = $schema->resultset( 'Release' );
    $rs->by_dist( 'My-Dist', '0.001' );
    $rs->by_author( 'PREACTION' );
    $rs->since( '2016-01-01T00:00:00' );
    $rs->maturity( 'stable' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object helps to query the per-release test report summaries. These
summaries say how many pass, fail, NA, and unknown results a single
version of a distribution has.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 by_dist

    $rs = $rs->by_dist( 'My-Dist' );
    $rs = $rs->by_dist( 'My-Dist', '0.001' );

Add a dist constraint to the query (with optional version), replacing
any previous dist constraints.

=head2 by_author

    $rs = $rs->by_author( 'PREACTION' );

Add an author constraint to the query, replacing any previous author
constraints.

=head2 since

    $rs = $rs->since( '2016-01-01T00:00:00' );

Restrict results to only those that have been updated since the given
ISO8601 date.

=head2 maturity

    $rs = $rs->maturity( 'stable' );

Restrict results to only those dists that are stable. Also supported:
'dev' to restrict to only development dists.

=head2 total_by_release

    $rs = $rs->total_by_release

Sum the pass/fail/na/unknown counts by release distribution and version.
