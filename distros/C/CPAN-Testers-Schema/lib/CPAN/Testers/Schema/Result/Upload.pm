=head1 DESCRIPTION

This table contains information about uploads to CPAN, including who
uploaded it, when it was uploaded, and when it was deleted (and thus
only available to BackPAN).

B<NOTE>: Since files can be deleted from PAUSE, and new files uploaded
with the same name, distribution, and version, there may be duplicate
C<< dist => version >> pairs in this table. This table does not
determine which packages were authorized and indexed by PAUSE for
installation by CPAN clients.

This data is read directly from the local CPAN mirror by
L<CPAN::Testers::Data::Uploads> and written to this table.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 uploadid

The ID of this upload. Auto-generated.

=head2 type

This column indicates where the distribution is. It can be one of three values:

=over 4

=item cpan

This distribution is on CPAN

=item backpan

This distribution has been deleted from CPAN and is only available on BackPAN

=item upload

This distribution has been reported via NNTP (nntp.perl.org group perl.cpan.uploads),
but has not yet been seen on CPAN itself.

=back

=head2 author

The PAUSE ID of the user who uploaded this distribution.

=head2 dist

The distribution name, parsed from the uploaded file's name using
L<CPAN::DistnameInfo>.

=head2 version

The version of the distribution, parsed from the uploaded file's name
using L<CPAN::DistnameInfo>.

=head2 filename

The full file name uploaded to CPAN, without the author directory prefix.

=head2 released

The date/time of the dist release. Calculated from the file's modified
time, as synced by the CPAN mirror sync system, or from the upload
notification message time from the NNTP group.

Inflated from a UNIX epoch into a L<DateTime> object.
