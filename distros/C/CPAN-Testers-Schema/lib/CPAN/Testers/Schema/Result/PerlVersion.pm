=head1 DESCRIPTION

This table holds metadata about known Perl versions. Through this table we can
quickly list which Perl versions are stable/development.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 version

The Perl version reported by the tester. This is the primary key.

=head2 perl

The parsed version of Perl in C<REVISION.VERSION.SUBVERSION> format.

If not specified when creating a new row, the Perl version will be parsed
and this field updated accordingly.

=head2 patch

If true (C<1>), this Perl has patches applied. Defaults to false (C<0>).

If not specified when creating a new row, the Perl version will be parsed
and this field updated accordingly.

=head2 devel

If true (C<1>), this Perl is a development Perl version. Development Perl
versions have an odd C<VERSION> field (the second number) like C<5.27.0>,
C<5.29.0>, C<5.31.0>, etc... Release candidates (like C<5.28.0 RC0>) are
also considered development versions.

If not specified when creating a new row, the Perl version will be parsed
and this field updated accordingly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor will automatically fill in any missing information based
on the supplied C<version> field.
