Changelog for CPAN-Testers-Schema

0.005     2016-12-11 00:36:54-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed dependency declaration for DateTime and
      DateTime::Format::ISO8601

0.004     2016-12-10 02:45:36-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Properly inflate CPAN upload `released` column into a DateTime
      object. This makes for a better API so that we can, eventually,
      change the data type from epoch timestamp to ISO8601 date/time.

0.003     2016-12-09 19:55:09-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added CPAN uploads data query module
      (CPAN::Testers::Schema::ResultSet::Upload) to query data from CPAN
      uploads.

    [Other]

    - Switched to DBIx::Class::Candy for cleaner result classes

0.002     2016-11-19 11:53:54-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added relationship between report statistics and release
      summaries. This relationship can be used to see when the release
      summary was last updated.

    - Added release data query module
      (CPAN::Testers::Schema::ResultSet::Release) for easier querying of
      release data. This will be used to provide summary data for
      metacpan and various CPAN author dashboards.

    [Fixed]

    - Properly enabled all Perl 5.24 features. Since we're relying on
      it, we should be using it to the fullest!

0.001     2016-11-18 15:06:56-06:00 America/Chicago

 - This initial release contains a schema for some tables in the
   `cpanstats` database, with more tables to come later. This release is
   minimal to enable its use in the new CPAN Testers API, coming later.

   Hello from meta::hack 2016 in Chicago!
