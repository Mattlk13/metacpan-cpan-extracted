Changelog for CPAN-Testers-Schema

0.008     2017-05-13 10:53:47+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Fixed]

    - Updated metabase users table to add unique constraint to user
      GUID. The source table has multiple mappings for a single user,
      but as @bingos pointed out: This means that some e-mails for
      a user are completely inaccurate, bordering on malicious (since
      authors cannot get in touch with testers). The new table has only
      one mapping per GUID, and we can then update that mapping if
      a tester complains.

0.007     2017-05-12 17:52:23+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Added]

    - Add a "created" field to the TestReport table to keep track of
      when the test report was created
    - Auto serialize the TestReport to/from JSON
    - Add the ID and created date/time to the JSON test report
    - Add a table to hold the old Metabase user information so we can
      find name/email for legacy clients
    - Add a conversion method from Metabase::Fact to the new test
      report. This allows legacy clients to send in Metabase reports and
      be updated to the new test report format.


0.006     2017-05-12 10:02:58+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Added]

    - TestReport table for storing new test reports as JSON documents
    - cpantesters-schema script for deploying the new database schema
      [Github #2]
    - Add `updated` column to raw test reports to keep track of when
      they were updated

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed all the MySQL foreign key constraints. Foreign key columns
      need to be exactly the same column type as their foreign
      counterpart.

0.005     2016-12-11 00:36:54-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed dependency declaration for DateTime and
      DateTime::Format::ISO8601

0.004     2016-12-10 02:45:36-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Properly inflate CPAN upload `released` column into a DateTime
      object. This makes for a better API so that we can, eventually,
      change the data type from epoch timestamp to ISO8601 date/time.

0.003     2016-12-09 19:55:09-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added CPAN uploads data query module
      (CPAN::Testers::Schema::ResultSet::Upload) to query data from CPAN
      uploads.

    [Other]

    - Switched to DBIx::Class::Candy for cleaner result classes

0.002     2016-11-19 11:53:54-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added relationship between report statistics and release
      summaries. This relationship can be used to see when the release
      summary was last updated.

    - Added release data query module
      (CPAN::Testers::Schema::ResultSet::Release) for easier querying of
      release data. This will be used to provide summary data for
      metacpan and various CPAN author dashboards.

    [Fixed]

    - Properly enabled all Perl 5.24 features. Since we're relying on
      it, we should be using it to the fullest!

0.001     2016-11-18 15:06:56-06:00 America/Chicago

 - This initial release contains a schema for some tables in the
   `cpanstats` database, with more tables to come later. This release is
   minimal to enable its use in the new CPAN Testers API, coming later.

   Hello from meta::hack 2016 in Chicago!
