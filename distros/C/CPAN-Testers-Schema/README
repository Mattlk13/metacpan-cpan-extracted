CPAN::Testers::Schema

This is a DBIx::Class Schema for the CPANTesters statistics database.
This database is generated by processing the incoming data from the
CPANTesters Metabase <http://metabase.cpantesters.org>, and extracting
the useful fields like distribution, version, platform, and others (see
CPAN::Testers::Schema::Result::Stats for a full list).

This is its own distribution so that it can be shared by the backend
processing, data APIs, and the frontend web application.
