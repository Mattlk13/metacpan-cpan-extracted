      lookup_in_store(objectName, AAT, lang:nl)

      aat_search(objectName, -lang:nl)

DESCRIPTION

 Catmandu::Store::AAT

      lookup_in_store(
        objectName,
        AAT,
        lang: nl
      )

    The lang parameter is optional and defaults to nl. It sets the language
    of the returned prefLabel. If no prefLabel for the Subject in provided
    lang exists, nothing is returned.

    The store takes the dc:identifier of a Subject from the AAT and returns
    the following data:

      {
        'id'        => 'The dc:identifier of the Subject',
        'prefLabel' => 'The prefLabel in the provided language',
        'uri'       => 'The URI of the Subject'
      }

 Catmandu::Fix::aat_match

      aat_match(
        path,
        -lang: nl
      )

    A fix that performs a match between a term and a prefLabel of an AAT
    Subject.

 Catmandu::Fix::aat_search

      aat_search(
        path,
        -lang: nl
      )

    A fix that performs a search for a term in the AAT.
