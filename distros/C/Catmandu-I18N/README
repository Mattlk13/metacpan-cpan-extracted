    Catmandu::I18N - tools for text localisation

SYNOPSIS

        use Catmandu::Sane;
    
        use Catmandu::I18N;
    
        my $i = Catmandu::I18N->new(
            config => {
                en => [
                  "Gettext",
                  "/path/to/en.po"
                ],
                nl => [
                  "Gettext",
                  "/path/to/nl.po"
                ]
            }
        );
    
        $i->t( "my-lang", "my-key" );
        $i->t( "my-lang", "my-key2", "arg-1", "arg-2" );

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS

    config

      Configuration for Locale::Maketext.

      Must be either:

      * hash reference

      * string (e.g. "i18n")

      When the config is a string, it is interpreted as the path to the
      I18N configuration in Catmandu config.

      Required

    on_failure

      What to do when a lookup does not give a result.

      Possible values:

      * "undef" : return undef

      * "auto" : return key itself. Always a result.

      * "die" : die

      Default: "undef"

      Note: "undef" should be a string, as opposed to undef.

    fallback_languages

      array of fallback language codes

      * must be array reference

      * default is [ "i-default","en","en-US" ] as determined by
      Locale::Maketext

      When Locale::Maketext does not find the specified language in your
      config, it will fallback to one of these, and then load the handle
      for that.

      Only if that fallback language does not exist in the config, will it
      fail.

      Example 1:

      fallback_languages is [ "en" ]

      you have only language "en" in your config, but you request language
      "nl", then you'll get the message in English.

      Example 2:

      fallback_languages is [ "en" ]

      you have only language "nl" in your config, but you request language
      "fr", then the creation of the message will fail

      You can set this to an empty array for consistent behaviour.

NOTES

    * the lexicon implementation determines the format of the message.

    e.g. only Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::Gettext supports placeholders like
    %1.

    For other implementations you need to use placeholders like [_1]
