SYNOPSIS

     use Config::Apachish::Reader;
     my $reader = Config::Apachish::Reader->new(
         # list of known attributes, with their default values
     );
     my $config_array = $reader->read_file('config.conf');

DESCRIPTION

    This module reads Apachish configuration files (a format mostly
    compatible with Apache webserver configuration format). It is a
    minimalist alternative to the more fully-featured Config::Apachish. It
    cannot write/modify Apachish files and is optimized for low startup
    overhead.

ATTRIBUTES

    Prior arts: Config::ApacheFormat, Apache::ConfigFile, Config::General,
    Config::ApacheExtended. A more in-depth comparison between these
    modules and Apachish will be made in the future.
