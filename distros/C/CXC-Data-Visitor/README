CXC::Data::Visitor

CXC::Data::Visitor provides a means of performing a depth first
traversal of a data structure. There are similar modules on CPAN ("SEE
ALSO"); this module provides a few extras:

*   The traversal may be aborted.

*   A container (hash or array) may be immediately revisited if the
    callback requests it.

*   An element whose value is a container may be revisited after the
    container is visited if the callback requests it.

*   User selectable behavior upon detection of a traversal cycle.

*   The complete path from the structure route to an element (both the
    ancestor containers and the keys and indexes required to traverse
    the path) is available.
