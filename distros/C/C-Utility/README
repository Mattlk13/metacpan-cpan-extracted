1. ABOUT

C::Utility - utilities for generating C programs

This module contains functions which assist in automatic generation of
C programs.  "convert_to_c_string" converts a string into a string
with characters correctly escaped for use in a C
program. "convert_to_c_string_pc" does the same thing plus escaping
percent signs so that they may be used as format strings for
printf. "ch_files" makes a header file name from a C file
name. "escape_string" escapes double quotes. "valid_c_variable"
checks whether a string is valid as a C variable. "wrapper_name"
returns a C preprocessor wrapper name. "print_top_h_wrapper" prints
the top wrapper for a header file, and "print_bottom_h_wrapper"
prints the bottom part. "print_include" prints "#include"
statements. "hash_to_c_file" converts a Perl hash into a compilable
C file with the keys as C strings. "line_directive" prints a C line
directive. "brute_force_line" puts line directives on every
line. "add_lines" converts the string #line to line directives as do
"linein" and "lineout". "remove_quotes" removes leading and
trailing quotes. "stamp_file" adds a printed stamp to a file handle.
