SYNOPSIS

    In Person.pm:

     package Person;
     
     use Class::Tiny::Chained qw( name );
     
     1;

    In Employee.pm:

     package Employee;
     use parent 'Person';
     
     use Class::Tiny::Chained qw( ssn ), {
       timestamp => sub { time }    # attribute with default

    In example.pl:

     use Employee;
     
     my $obj = Employee->new( name => "Larry", ssn => "111-22-3333" );
     
     # attribute setters are chainable
     my $obj = Employee->new->name("Fred")->ssn("444-55-6666");
     my $ts = $obj->name("Bob")->timestamp;

DESCRIPTION

    Class::Tiny::Chained is a wrapper around Class::Tiny which makes the
    generated attribute accessors chainable; that is, when setting an
    attribute value, the object is returned so that further methods can be
    called.
