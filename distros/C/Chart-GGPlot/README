NAME

    Chart::GGPlot - ggplot2 port in Perl

VERSION

    version 0.0003

STATUS

    At this moment this library is experimental and still under active
    development (at my after-work time). It's still quite incomplete
    compared to R's ggplot2 library, but the core features are working.

    Besides, it heavily depends on my Alt::Data::Frame::ButMore library,
    which is also experimental.

SYNOPSIS

        use Chart::GGPlot qw(:all);
        use Data::Frame::Examples qw(mtcars);
    
        my $plot = ggplot(
            data => mtcars(),
            mapping => aes( x => 'wt', y => 'mpg' )
        )->geom_point();
    
        # show in browser
        $plot->show;
    
        # export to image file
        $plot->save('mtcars.png');
    
        # see "examples" dir of this library's distribution for more examples.

DESCRIPTION

    This Chart-GGPlot library is an implementation of ggplot2
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ggplot2> in Perl. It's designed to be
    possible to support multiple plotting backends. And it ships a default
    backend which uses Chart::Plotly.

    This Chart::GGPlot module is the function interface of the Perl
    Chart-GGPlot library.

    Example exported image files:

    See the examples dir in the library's distribution for more examples.

 Document Conventions

    Function signatures in docs of this library follow the
    Function::Parameters conventions, for example,

        myfunc(Type1 $positional_parameter, Type2 :$named_parameter)

FUNCTIONS

 ggplot

        ggplot(:$data, :$mapping, %rest)

    This is same as Chart::GGPlot::Plot->new(...). See Chart::GGPlot::Plot
    for details.

 qplot

        qplot((Piddle1D|ArrayRef) :$x, (Piddle1D|ArrayRef) :$y,
            Str :$geom='auto',
            :$xlim=undef, :$ylim=undef,
            Str :$log='',
            Maybe[Str] :$title=undef, Str :$xlab='x', Str :$ylab='y',
            %rest)

    Arguments:

      * $x, $y

      Data. Supports either 1D piddles or arrayrefs. When arrayref is
      specified, it would be converted to either a numeric piddle or a
      PDL::SV piddle, guessing by its contents.

      * $geom

      Geom type. "auto" is treated as 'point'. It would internally call a
      geom_${geom} function.

      * $xlim, $ylim

      Axes limits.

      * $log

      Which axis use logarithmic scale? One of '', 'x', 'y', 'xy'.

      * $title

      Plot title. Default is undef, for no title.

      * $xlabel, $ylabel

      Axes labels.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

 CHART_GGPLOT_TRACE

    A positive integer would enable debug messages.
