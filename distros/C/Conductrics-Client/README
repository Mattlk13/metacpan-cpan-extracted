NAME
    Conductrics Client

DESCRIPTION
    This class give access to Conductrics Management API to:

     - define
     - create 
     - delete

    an agent.

    At start, I've written this class to automate tests of
    Conductrics::Agent, the user has not to learn how to create agent in
    Conductrics console before to run tests of Conductrics::Agent.

    With this class you can automate the agent definition, use your data to
    create them in programmatic way, and I'm sure that it's better and
    powerfull.

SYNOPSIS
        use Conductrics::Client;

        my $client = Conductrics::Client->new(
            apiKey=>'',    # place your managent (admin) apikey here
            ownerCode=>'', # place your ownerCode here
            baseUrl=>'http://api.conductrics.com',
        );

        #
        # An agent will make decisions on the conductrics server.
        #

        my $decision_points = [
            $client->define_decision_point(
                'home_page',
                $client->define_decision( 'colour', qw/red green blue/ ),
                $client->define_decision( 'font', qw/arial verdana/ )
            ),
            $client->define_decision_point(
                'auction',
                $client->define_decision( 'message_mood', qw/estatic happy gambling/ ),
                $client->define_decision( 'sort_by', qw/price time/ )
            ),
        ];

        my $goals = $client->define_goals(qw/ registration bet sold subscription /);

        my $main_site_definition = $client->define_agent('main_site', $goals, $decision_points);

        unless ($client->validate_agent($client->get_json_schema, $main_site_definition)) {
             die("agent defition is not valid for agent json schema");
        }

        if ($client->create_agent('main_site', $main_site_definition)) {
            ... # success: agent is ready on conductrics server
        }

    From another script/program you can then use the agent:

        my $agent = Conductrics::Agent->new(
            name=>'main_site',
            apiKey=>'',    # place your runtime apikey here
            ownerCode=>'', # place your ownerCode here
            baseUrl=>'http://api.conductrics.com',
        );

        ... see Conductrics::Agent documentation

METHODS
  create_agent( $agent_name, $content)
  create_agent($agent_name, $hashref_definition)
  create_agent($agent_name, $json_definition)
    $content can be a json description of the Agent according the agent json
    schema.

      create_agent('test-agent', $json);

    $json contains json agent description

      create_agent('test-agent', $hashref);

    $hashref contains agent descrition as Perl structure that will be
    encoded to json.

  define_agent($agent_name, $goals_list, $decisionpoints_list)
  define_goals(@goals)
  define_goals({},{});
    you can provide list of names: $client->define_goals('micky
    mouse','pluto');

    or can provide a list of hashref: $client->define_goals({name=>'micky
    mouse'}.{name=>'pluto'});

    with codes too: $client->define_goals({code=>1, name=>'micky
    mouse'}.{code=>2, name=>'pluto'});

    or calling define_goal()

        $client->define_goals($client->define_goal('micky mouse', 1),
                              $client->define_goal('pluto', 2));

    or calling define_goal() with settings

        $client->define_goals($client->define_goal('micky mouse', 1, {min=>1, max=>5, default=>0, limit=>3}),
                              $client->define_goal('pluto', 2, {min=>1, max=>2, default=>1, limit=>5}));

    Look for goal's setting in help conductrics manual, for more info and
    their meanings.

  define_goal($name, $code)
  define_goal($name, $code, {min=>1, max=>3, default=>0, limit=>0})
    You can define a goals with more details.

  delete_agent($agent_name)
  get_json_schema
    It gets json schema for agent definition.

  validate_agent
    It validates json against json schema.

TESTS
    You have to set some env to execute t/02-define_agent.t You will find
    your data into Account/Keys and Users page.

    Required env for execute full test's suite:

           Conductrics_apikey
           Conductrics_ownerCode
           Conductrics_Mng_apikey  admin/management apikey

    Test's sources are good examples about how to use this API, so "Use The
    Source Luke".

MORE INFO
    Conductrics has many help pages available from the console, so signup
    and read it.

    There are also Report API, Management API and Targetting Rule API.
