NAME
    Carp::Patch::Verbose - Set some Carp variables so stack trace is more
    verbose

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Carp::Patch::Verbose (from Perl
    distribution Carp-Patch-Verbose), released on 2022-02-06.

SYNOPSIS
     % perl -MCarp::Patch::Verbose -d:Confess ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is not so much a "patch" for Carp, but just a convenient way to set
    some Carp package variables from the command-line. Currently these
    variables are set:

     $Carp::MaxArgLen  # from the default 64 to 0 (print all)
     $Carp::MaxArgNums # from the default  8 to 0 (print all)

    This setting makes full dumps of arguments instead of just partial ones.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
