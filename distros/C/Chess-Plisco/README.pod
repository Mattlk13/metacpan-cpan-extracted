=head1 Chess-Plisco

Chess::Plisco is a representation of a chess position in Perl. It also
contains a UCI compatible chess engine.

It only works with Perl versions that are compiled with support for 64
bit integers!

The software is stable but still considered work in progress.

Since it is reasonably fast and offers a lot of functionality needed for
chess engines, it can be used for rapid prototyping of a chess engine.
Writing a basic implementation of the AlphaBeta algorithm with
C<Chess::Plisco> will not require more than 30 lines of code.

The library also has a very high test coverage so that you can probably
use it as a reference implementation for your own experiments and tests.

=head2 Installation

Apart from Perl (which ships with your operating system unless you use
MS-DOS aka MS Windows), the software has little dependencies:

=over

=item * LLL<https://github.com/Perl-Critic/PPI>

=item * LLL<https://github.com/gflohr/libintl-perl> from
LLL<http://www.guido-flohr.net/en/projects/#libintl-perl>

=back

Probably both dependencies are available for your system. Search your
package manager for "PPI" and "libintl-perl".

Alternatively, install the command "cpanm" and do:

 $ cpanm Chess::Plisco

This installs the last release of the software.

If you want to use the latest sources from git, build and install it
with the usual sequence of commands:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make install

=head2 Library

See the L<lib/Chess/Plisco/Tutorial.pod> for a gentle
introduction to the library. When installed, you can also try the
command C<perldoc Chess::Plisco::Tutorial>.

Reference documentation is available for
L<lib/Chess/Plisco.pod> (C<perldoc Chess::Plisco>) and
L<lib/Chess/Plisco/Macro.pod>
(C<perldoc Chess::Plisco::Macro>).

=head2 Engine

=head3 Running the Engine

The chess engine is started with the command "plisco". You can also run
it from inside the repository like this:

 $ perl -Ilib bin/plisco

The engine needs some time to come up because it compiles a number of
lookup tables. If you run it from a git checkout, it will also need time
to parse its own source code and expand the macros contained.

=head3 Graphical User Interfaces

Like almost all chess engines, plisco does not come with a graphical
user interface. Try using one of these:

=over

=item * LLL<https://cutechess.com/> (Linux, MacOS, and Windows)

=item * LLL<https://banksiagui.com/> (Linux, MacOS, and Windows)

=item * LLL<http://www.playwitharena.de/> (Linux, Windows)
