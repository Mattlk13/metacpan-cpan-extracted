0.13      2024-05-12 16:00:28-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUGFIX]

    * update to work with changed API in Hash::Wrap >= 1.0

0.12      2023-04-10 13:42:39-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUGFIX]

    * CXC::Number::Grid
      * The object returned by ->pdl() should have returned a PDL
        ndarray object for the 'include' method instead of a Perl array.
      * the objects returned by ->pdl() and ->bignum() didn't contain
        all of the attributes of the parent object.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * CXC::Number::Grid
      * new methods: to_string, and, and_n
      * new overloads: logical AND (&)


0.11      2023-04-03 21:16:09-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUGFIX]

    * CXC::Number::Grid: use of '|' overload when 'bitwise' feature
      was on resulted in a exception.

  [BUILD]

    * require Perl 5.28 (not 5.26) as state variables are initialized
      in list context. CPANTesters FTW (++BINGOS, ++SREZIC)

    * CXC::Number::Grid:
      * Change "snap-to" distance in tests to see if CPAN failures are
        due to floating point comparison issues.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * Grid constructor can accept bin boundries instead of edges

0.09      2023-04-01 21:14:51-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * CXC::Number::Grid
      * new methods: TO_HASH, combine_bins, not, or, or_n
      * new overloads: logical NOT (!), logical OR (|)
