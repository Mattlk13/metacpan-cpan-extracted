SYNOPSIS

     use Config::IOD;
     my $iod = Config::IOD->new(
         # list of known attributes, with their default values
         # default_section     => 'GLOBAL',
         # enable_encoding     => 1,
         # enable_quoting      => 1,
         # enable_backet       => 1,
         # enable_brace        => 1,
         # allow_encodings     => undef, # or ['base64','json',...]
         # disallow_encodings  => undef, # or ['base64','json',...]
         # allow_directives    => undef, # or ['include','merge',...]
         # disallow_directives => undef, # or ['include','merge',...]
         # allow_bang_only     => 1,
         # enable_expr         => 0,
         # allow_duplicate_key => 1,
         # ignore_unknown_directive => 0,
     );

    Read IOD/INI document from a file or string, return
    Config::IOD::Document object:

     my $doc = $iod->read_file("/path/to/some.iod");
     my $doc = $iod->read_string("...");

    See Config::IOD::Document for methods available for $doc.

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a round-trip parser for IOD configuration format (IOD is
    an INI-like format with more precise specification, some extra
    features, and 99% compatible with typical INI format). Round-trip means
    all whitespaces and comments are preserved, so you get byte-by-byte
    equivalence if you dump back the parsed document into string.

    Aside from parsing, methods for modifying IOD documents (add/delete
    sections & keys, etc) are also provided.

    If you only need to read IOD configuration files, you might want to use
    Config::IOD::Reader instead.

ATTRIBUTES

    # INSERT_BLOCK: Config::IOD::Base attributes

METHODS

 new(%attrs) => obj

 $reader->read_file($filename) => obj

    Read IOD configuration from a file. Return Config::IOD::Document
    instance. Die on errors.

 $reader->read_string($str) => obj

    Read IOD configuration from a string. Return Config::IOD::Document
    instance. Die on errors.

SEE ALSO

    IOD - specification

    Config::IOD::Reader - if you just need to read a configuration file,
    you should probably use this module instead. It's lighter, faster, and
    has a simpler interface.
