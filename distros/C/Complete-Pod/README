NAME
    Complete::Pod - Complete with installed Perl .pod names

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Complete::Pod (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Pod), released on 2019-06-03.

SYNOPSIS
     use Complete::Pod qw(complete_pod);
     my $res = complete_pod(word => 'Text::A');
     # -> ['CGI', 'CORE', 'Config', 'perllocal', 'perlsecret']

FUNCTIONS
  complete_pod
    Usage:

     complete_pod(%args) -> any

    Complete with installed Perl .pod names.

    This is basically Complete::Module's "complete_module" but with
    "find_pm"=0, "find_pmc"=0, and "find_pod"=1.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   find_prefix => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to find module prefixes.

    *   ns_prefix => *str*

        Namespace prefix.

        This is useful if you want to complete module under a specific
        namespace (instead of the root). For example, if you set "ns_prefix"
        to "Dist::Zilla::Plugin" (or "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::") and word is
        "F", you can get "['FakeRelease', 'FileFinder::', 'FinderCode']"
        (those are modules under the "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::" namespace).

    *   path_sep => *str*

        Path separator.

        For convenience in shell (bash) completion, instead of defaulting to
        "::" all the time, will look at "word". If word does not contain any
        "::" then will default to "/". This is because "::" (contains colon)
        is rather problematic as it is by default a word-break character in
        bash and the word needs to be quoted to avoid word-breaking by bash.

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

        Word to complete.

    Return value: (any)
