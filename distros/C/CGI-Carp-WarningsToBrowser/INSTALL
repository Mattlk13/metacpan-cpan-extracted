    Installing CGI-Carp-WarningsToBrowser should be straightforward.

INSTALLATION WITH CPANMINUS
    If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

            % cpanm CGI::Carp::WarningsToBrowser

    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass
    the "-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

            % cpanm -S CGI::Carp::WarningsToBrowser

INSTALLATION WITH THE CPAN SHELL
    Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to
    do:

            % cpan CGI::Carp::WarningsToBrowser

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball and
    unpack it.

    Consult the file 'cpanfile' for a list of pre-requisites. Install these
    first.

    To build CGI-Carp-WarningsToBrowser:

            % perl Build.PL
            % ./Build && ./Build test

    Then install it:

            % ./Build install

    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

            % sudo ./Build install
