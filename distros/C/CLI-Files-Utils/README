CLI-Files-Utils

 The following 2 files for handling bunch of files on your computer
 will be installed, which augment functionality of Unix/Linux commands 
 such as 'ls' and 'find'. 

   1. madeafter : shows the 3 time-info ({a,m,c}time) of files in a single shot. 
   2. dirhier : the file count at each directory depth, speedily. 
   3. colorplus : colors on numbers for eyes to read numbers easily by "colorplus -3".

 The detail of each program is accessed by "madeafter --help" or "dirhier --help", 
 but written only in Japanese for dirhier.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

But you do not need to follow the "Build" instruction above.
The files decompressed from the *.tar.gz files contain program files
under "scripts/" directory, and each of the programs works stand-alone
as a Perl script. 

Thus you can copy them to any directory you like, then you can run them
(by taking care of the file permissions and the command path).
