CLI-Files-Utils

 The following programs for handling bunch of files on your computer
 will be installed, which augment functionality of Unix/Linux commands 
 such as 'ls' and 'find', also accomanying other utility programs. 

   1. madeafter : shows the 3 time-info ({a,m,c}time) of files in a single shot. 
   2. dirhier : the file count at each directory depth, speedily. 

   3. colorplus : colors on numbers for eyes to read numbers easily by "colorplus -3".
   4. init.sh : to install the programs above with the minimum computational affecting.

 The detail of each program is accessed as "madeafter --help" or "dirhier --help", 
 but written only in Japanese for dirhier.


INSTALLATION

 The programs are provided in a form of Perl modules to 
 be uploaded on CPAN. Each of the program is written
 as a single Perl program that works (almost) stand-alone.


 You can choose the way to install programs from the following
 plural ways. 

1. Download and uncompress the file CLI-Files-Utils-*.tar.gz 
   from CPAN. Find the programs under the "scripts" directory
   inside it. Copy them into wherever you like and you can
   (and call it "someWhere" in the next paragraph.) 

   Then add that directory someWhere to the PATH environment 
   variable (for either of Windows or Unix-like environments). 
   If you use bash or zsh, add a line like the following
   into to  .bash_profile or .zshrc respectively, to use the 
   program files provided in this module always you login, 
   with the minimum affect to your computer environment: 

      source someWhere/init.sh

2. If you like "Build" methot to install CPAN modules, 
   run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

3. You can also install the programs by the following steps:

    cpan CLI::Files::Utils 

   or

    cpanm CLI::Files::Utils

   The above requires your knowledge/understanding of
   the prepation of using the commands of 'cpan' or 'cpanm'
   and administrative rights on your computer to install 
   programs (root privileges). 

   This optional installaion way (3.) is written here because
   the author of the programs just want to explain that 
   the programs provided are uploaded to CPAN can work 
   in a kind of standard way.  


But you do not need to follow the "Build" instruction above.
The files decompressed from the *.tar.gz files contain program files
under "scripts/" directory, and each of the programs works stand-alone
as a Perl script. 

Thus you can copy them to any directory you like, then you can run them
(by taking care of the file permissions and the command path).
