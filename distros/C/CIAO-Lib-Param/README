CIAO::Lib::Param

CIAO::Lib::Param is a Perl interface to the parameter library (cxcparam)
shipped with the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO)
software package. It implements an interface to IRAF (Image Reduction
and Analysis Facility) style parameter files.

This document does not fully discuss the format and usage of parameter
files; see <http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/parameter.html> for more
information.

CIAO::Lib::Param provides both object oriented and quick and dirty
procedural interfaces. See the "OBJECT INTERFACE" and "PROCEDURAL
INTERFACE" sections for the two interfaces.

The Perl interface presents unified error reports from the underlying
cxcparam library. If an error is encountered, the module will throw an
exception via croak(). For simple applications, simply not catching the
exception with "eval{}" will cause the application to terminate.

For more complicated handling, one can use the exception (which is a
CIAO::Lib::Param::Error object) to determine more information about what
happened.
