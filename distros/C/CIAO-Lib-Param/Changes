        - level 0 errors to paramerr are non-fatal but were being
          treated as fatal.  they are now printed to stderr as
          cxcparam uses them only in areas where a terminal is assumed
          to be present.  kludgy, but it works for now.

        - one more try to get the set() method to properly distinguish
          Perl booleans from strings so that boolean strings ('yes',
          'no') are passed through while Perl booleans are converted
          to strings.
        - added pquery() class method

0.03  2005-06-14T15:51:27+00:00
        - set() now automatically converts from Perl booleans to the
          string form required by cxcparam.

        - the internal mechanism used to report errors was rewritten;
          it was too complicated and caused problems when a Param object
          was destroyed during the cleanup phase.

        - can now pass extra arguments to pget, as in new.

        - passing of extra arguments to paramopen was done incorrectly,
          leading to segv's

        - now supports paramopen's two methods of supplying a
          parameter file name.
