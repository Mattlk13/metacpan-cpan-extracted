CIAO/Lib/Param/Error.pm

version 0.09

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  eval {
    ... calls to CIAO::Lib::Param ...
  };
  if ( my $e = $@ )
  {
     .. manipulations of $e ..
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Depending upon how an error is generated, the cxcparam library returns
error information which contains multiple fields.  The underlying
library returns errors in two fashions:

=over

=item 1

returning an integer error code

=item 2

generating a text message and bailing out

=back

In the second case, the error should be considered fatal, as
the library's data structures are left in an indeterminate state.

In order to simplify error interactions, the Perl interface always
throws an exception via croak upon error.  For simple applications,
not catching the exception (by doing nothing) will cause the
application to terminate.

For more fine-grained error handling, more information is required.
To that end, CIAO::Lib::Param throws a CIAO::Lib::Param::Error object,
which resolves to a printable string when used in the appropriate
context.  Otherwise, it can be used to obtain more information about
the error.

=head2 Methods

=over

=item error

This is the message printed when the object is used in a scalar
context.  It constructed either from C<errstr> or from C<errmsg>, if
the latter is defined.

=item errno

This is a cxcparam standard error code.  See the cxcparam source
code for more information on what the error codes mean.

=item errstr

This is the standard description associated with the cxcparam errors.

=item errmsg

If the cxcparam library reported an error via the second path
mentioned above, this will return the generated message, else it
returns undef.  This method can be used to determine if the
application should attempt to recover from an error.
