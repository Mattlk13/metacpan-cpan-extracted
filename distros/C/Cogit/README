HERE BE DRAGONS

    This module's API is not yet battle tested. Feel free to try it out,
    but don't depend on it for serious stuff yet. Comments regarding the
    API very welcome.

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a Pure Perl interface to Git repositories.

    It was mostly based on Grit http://grit.rubyforge.org/.

METHODS

    master

    get_object

    get_object_packed

    get_object_loose

    create_object

    all_sha1s

FORK

    This module was forked from Git::PurePerl for a couple reasons. First
    and foremost, Git::PurePerl is based on Moose, which is not pure perl.
    Secondarily the API was very weird, with differentiations made based on
    whether or not an object was in the repo or not.
