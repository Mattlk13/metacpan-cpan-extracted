# Indentation

- indent with tabs; 1 tab = 1 ident level
- every open `(`, `{`, or `[` indents like block: indent +1
  - can collapse (ie, `({` only +1
- postfix operators: indent +1
- no space after tab

# Align

If align, align position must be on position divisible by 4
(counting from first non-whitespace character on line)

Align only same indent level.
