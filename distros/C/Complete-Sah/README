NAME
    Complete::Sah - Sah-related completion routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.008 of Complete::Sah (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Sah), released on 2021-07-29.

SYNOPSIS
     use Complete::Sah qw(complete_from_schema);
     my $res = complete_from_schema(word => 'a', schema=>[str => {in=>[qw/apple apricot banana/]}]);
     # -> {words=>['apple', 'apricot'], static=>0}

FUNCTIONS
  complete_from_schema
    Usage:

     complete_from_schema(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Complete a value from schema.

    Employ some heuristics to complete a value from Sah schema. For example,
    if schema is "[str => in => [qw/new open resolved rejected/]]", then we
    can complete from the "in" clause. Or for something like "[int =>
    between => [1, 20]]" we can complete using values from 1 to 20.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   schema* => *any*

        Will be normalized, unless when "schema_is_normalized" is set to
        true, in which case schema must already be normalized.

    *   schema_is_normalized => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)
