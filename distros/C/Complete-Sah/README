NAME
    Complete::Sah - Sah-related completion routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Complete::Sah (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Sah), released on 2020-02-12.

SYNOPSIS
     use Complete::Sah qw(complete_from_schema);
     my $res = complete_from_schema(word => 'a', schema=>[str => {in=>[qw/apple apricot banana/]}]);
     # -> {words=>['apple', 'apricot'], static=>0}

FUNCTIONS
  complete_from_schema
    Usage:

     complete_from_schema(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Complete a value from schema.

    Employ some heuristics to complete a value from Sah schema. For example,
    if schema is "[str => in => [qw/new open resolved rejected/]]", then we
    can complete from the "in" clause. Or for something like "[int =>
    between => [1, 20]]" we can complete using values from 1 to 20.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   schema* => *any*

        Will be normalized, unless when "schema_is_normalized" is set to
        true, in which case schema must already be normalized.

    *   schema_is_normalized => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
