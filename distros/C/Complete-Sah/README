NAME
    Complete::Sah - Sah-related completion routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.013 of Complete::Sah (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Sah), released on 2023-05-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use Complete::Sah qw(complete_from_schema);
     my $res = complete_from_schema(word => 'a', schema=>[str => {in=>[qw/apple apricot banana/]}]);
     # -> {words=>['apple', 'apricot'], static=>0}

FUNCTIONS
  complete_from_schema
    Usage:

     complete_from_schema(%args) -> any

    Complete a value from schema.

    Employ some heuristics to complete a value from Sah schema. For example,
    if schema is "[str => in => [qw/new open resolved rejected/]]", then we
    can complete from the "in" clause. Or for something like "[int =>
    between => [1, 20]]" we can complete using values from 1 to 20.

    Tip: If you want to give summary for each entry in "in" clause, you can
    use the "x.in.summaries" attribute, example:

     # schema
     ['str', {
         in => ['b', 'g'],
         'x.in.summaries' => ['Male/boy', 'Female/girl'],
     }]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   schema* => *str|array*

        Will be normalized, unless when "schema_is_normalized" is set to
        true, in which case schema must already be normalized.

    *   schema_is_normalized => *bool* (default: 0)

        (No description)

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

        (No description)

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
