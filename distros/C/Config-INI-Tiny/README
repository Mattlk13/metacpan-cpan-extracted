Config::INI::Tiny

This is an extremely small amount of code for parsing the INI
configuration format, in its simplest form, as known from Microsoft
Windows.

Its design focuses on making it easy to extract whichever level of
semantics you need from your configuration: whether you want to care
about the order of properties; their recurrence; the order of sections;
treating each section header as a separate unit; or however else you want
to be able to interpret your configuration files â€” you can.
