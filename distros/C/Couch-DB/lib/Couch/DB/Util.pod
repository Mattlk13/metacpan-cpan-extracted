=item B<apply_tree>($tree, CODE)

Apply the CODE to all elements in the $tree.  Returns a new tree.

=item B<flat>(LIST|ARRAY)

Returns all defined elements found in the LIST or ARRAY.  The parameter
LIST may contain ARRAYs.

=item B<pile>(LIST|ARRAY)

Create a new ARRAY from the offered arguments, combining all elements
from the LIST and ARRAYs.  Undefined elements are removed.

=item B<simplified>($name, $data)

hence harder to interpret.
