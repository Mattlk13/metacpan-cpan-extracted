=head1 NAME

Couch::DB::Result - the reply of a CouchDB server call

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Any call to the CouchDB server result in this object.
  my $result = $couch->call($method, $path, %call_options);

  if($result->isReady) { ... }
  unless($result)      { ... }   # same

  my $doc = $result->doc;      # Couch::DB::Document

  # It's not always needed to inspect the document
  if($result->ok)      { ... }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The result of a call has many faces: it can be a usage error, a server
issue, empty, paged, or even delayed.  This Result object is able to
handle them all.  B<Read the DETAILS chapter below, to understand them all.>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item Couch::DB::Result-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

 -Option   --Default
  couch      <required>
  on_error   [ ]
  on_final   [ ]
  to_values  <keep data>

=over 2

=item couch => L<Couch::DB|Couch::DB>-object

=item on_error => CODE|ARRAY

Called each time when the result CODE changes to be "not a success".

=item on_final => CODE|ARRAY

Called when the Result object has either an error or an success.

=item to_values => CODE

Provide a sub which translates incoming JSON data from the server, into
pure perl.

=head2 Accessors

Generic accessors, not related to the Result content.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<code>()

Returns an HTTP status code (please use HTTP::Status), which reflects
the condition of the answer.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<codeName>( [$code] )

Return a string which represents the code.  For instance, code 200 will
produce string "HTTP_OK".

See CouchDB API section 1.1.4: "HTTP Status Codes" for the interpretation
of the codes.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<couch>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<isDelayed>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<isReady>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<message>()

Returns C<undef>, or a message (string) which explains why the status
is as it is.

=back

=head2 When the document is collected

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<answer>(%options)

Returns the received json answer as HASH of raw data.

You can better use the L<values()|Couch::DB::Result/"When the document is collected"> method, which returns the data in a far more
Perlish way: as Perl booleans, DateTime objects, and so on.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<client>()

Which client L<Couch::DB::Client|Couch::DB::Client> was used in the last action.  Initially,
none.  When the results are ready, the client is known.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<request>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<response>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<values>()

Each CouchDB API call knows whether it passes data types which are
(potentially) incompatible between JSON and Perl. Those types get
converted for you for convenience in your main program.

The raw data is returned with L<answer()|Couch::DB::Result/"When the document is collected">.  See L</DETAILS> below.

=back

=head2 When the collecting is delayed

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<delayPlan>()

Returns the (framework specific) information about actions to be taken to
collect the document.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<setFinalResult>(\%data, %options)

Fill this Result object with the actual results.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<setResultDelayed>($plan, %options)

When defined, the result document is not yet collected.  The $plan contains
framework specific information how to realize that in a later stage.

=back

=head2 Other

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<status>($code, $message)

Set the $code and $message to something else.  Your program should
probably not do this: it's the library which determines how the result
needs to be interpreted.

=back

=head1 DETAILS

This Result objects have many faces.  Understand them well, before you start
programming with L<Couch::DB|Couch::DB>.

=head2 Result is an error

The Result object is overloaded to produce a false value when the command did
not succeed for any reason.

B<. Example: without error handler>

  my $result = $db->find(...)
      or die $result->message;

B<. Example: with error handler>

  my $result = $db->find(..., on_error => sub { die } );

=head2 Delay the result

When your website has only the slightest chance on having users, then
you need to use single server processes shared by many website users.
Couch::DB implementations will use event-driven programming to make this
possible, but your own program should be configured to make use of this
to benefit.

Usually, questions to the database are purely serial.  This is an easy
case to handle, and totally hidden for you, as user of this module.
For instance, when you want to query in parallel, you need to prepare
multiple queries, and then start them at the same time.

B<. Example: prepare a query, delayed>

  my $find1 = $db->find(..., _delay => 1)
      or die $result->message;  # only preparation errors
  
  if($find1->isDelayed) ...;    # true
  
  my $result = $find1->run
      or die $result->message;  # network/server errors

  # TODO
  my $result = $couch->parallel([$find1, $find2], concurrent => 2);

=head2 Understanding values

To bridge the gap between your program and JSON data received, Couch::DB
provides templated conversions.  This conversion scheme also attempts to
hide protocol changes between CouchDB server versions.

  my $result = $couch->client('local')->serverInfo;
  result or die;

  # Try to avoid this:
  print $result->answer->{version}; # string

  # Use this instead:
  print $result->values->{version};  # version object

In some cases, data is added or modified for convenience: to make it
compatible with the version your program has been written for.  See
L<Couch::DB::new(api)|Couch::DB/"Constructors">.

=head1 OVERLOADING

=over 4

=item overload: B<bool>

These Return objecs are overloaded to return a false value when there is
any error.  For delayed collection of data, this status may change after
this object is initially created.
