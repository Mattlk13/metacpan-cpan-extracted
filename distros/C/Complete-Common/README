DESCRIPTION

    This module defines some common arguments and settings. Complete::*
    modules should use the default from these settings, to make it
    convenient for users to change some behaviors globally.

    The defaults are optimized for convenience and laziness for user typing
    and might change from release to release.

 $Complete::Common::OPT_CI => bool (default: from COMPLETE_OPT_CI or 1)

    If set to 1, matching is done case-insensitively.

    In bash/readline, this is akin to setting completion-ignore-case.

 $Complete::Common::OPT_WORD_MODE => bool (default: from
 COMPLETE_OPT_WORD_MODE or 1)

    If set to 1, enable word-mode matching.

    Word mode matching is normally only done when exact matching fails to
    return any candidate. To give you an idea of how word-mode matching
    works, you can run Emacs and try its completion of filenames (C-x C-f)
    or function names (M-x). Basically, each string is split into words and
    matching is tried for all available word even non-adjacent ones. For
    example, if you have dua-d and the choices are (dua-tiga, dua-empat,
    dua-lima-delapan) then dua-lima-delapan will match because d matches
    delapan even though the word is not adjacent. This is convenient when
    you have strings that are several or many words long: you can just type
    the starting letters of some of the words instead of just the starting
    letters of the whole string (which might need to be quite long before
    producing a unique match).

 $Complete::Common::OPT_CHAR_MODE => bool (default: from
 COMPLETE_OPT_CHAR_MODE or 1)

    If set to 1, enable character-mode matching.

    This mode is like word-mode matching, except it works on a
    character-by-character basis. Basically, it will match if a word
    contains any letters of the string in the correct order. For example,
    ap will match ap, amp, slap, or cramp (but will not match pa or pram).

    Character-mode matching is normally only done when exact matching and
    word-mode fail to return any candidate.

 $Complete::Common::OPT_FUZZY => int (default: from COMPLETE_OPT_FUZZY or
 1)

    Enable fuzzy matching (matching even though there are some spelling
    mistakes). The greater the number, the greater the tolerance. To
    disable fuzzy matching, set to 0.

    Fuzzy matching is normally only done when exact matching, word-mode,
    and char-mode matching fail to return any candidate.

 $Complete::Common::OPT_MAP_CASE => bool (default: from
 COMPLETE_OPT_MAP_CASE or 1)

    This is exactly like completion-map-case in readline/bash to treat _
    and - as the same when matching.

    All Complete::Path-based modules (like Complete::File,
    Complete::Module, or Complete::Riap) respect this setting.

 $Complete::Common::OPT_EXP_IM_PATH => bool (default: from
 COMPLETE_OPT_EXP_IM_PATH or 1)

    Whether to "expand intermediate paths". What is meant by this is
    something like zsh: when you type something like cd /h/u/b/myscript it
    can be completed to cd /home/ujang/bin/myscript.

    All Complete::Path-based modules (like Complete::File,
    Complete::Module, or Complete::Riap) respect this setting.

 $Complete::Common::OPT_DIG_LEAF => bool (default: from
 COMPLETE_OPT_DIG_LEAF or 1)

    (Experimental) When enabled, this option mimics what's seen on GitHub.
    If a directory entry only contains a single subentry, it will directly
    show the subentry (and subsubentry and so on) to save a number of tab
    presses.

    Suppose you have files like this:

     a
     b/c/d/e
     c

    If you complete for b you will directly get b/c/d/e (the leaf).

    This is currently experimental because if you want to complete only
    directories, you won't get b or b/c or b/c/d. Need to think how to
    solve this.
