NAME
    CPAN::Smoker::Utils - Set of CLI's to manage a Perl CPAN smoker machine

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports some functions used to manage a smoker testing
    machine based on CPAN::Reporter::Smoker.

  Command Line Interfaces programs
    The following programs are available under this distribution:

    *   "dblock": blocks a distribution to be tested in the smoker.

    *   "mirror_cleanup": further removes spurious files from a local CPAN
        mirror.

    *   "send_reports": send local stored tests results to a running
        metabase::relayd.

    You can check each program online documentation by using "perldoc
    dblock", "perldoc mirror_cleanup" and "perldoc send_reports" after
    installing the distribution.

EXPORTS
    Only the "sub" "is_distro_ok" is exported, if explicit requested.

  is_distro_ok
    Expects as parameter a string in the format "AUTHOR/DISTRIBUTION".

    It executes some very basic testing against the string.

    Returns true or false depending if the string passes the tests. It will
    also "warn" if things are not OK.

  block_distro
    Blocks a distribution to be tested under the smoker by using a
    distroprefs file.

    Expects as parameters:

    1.  a distribution name (for example, "JOHNDOE/Some-Distro-Name").

    2.  The perl interpreter (which is in execution) configuration.

    3.  An comment to include in the distroprefs file.

    It returns a hash reference containing keys/values that could be
    directly serialized to YAML (or other format) but the "full_path" key,
    that contains a suggest complete path to the distroprefs file (based on
    the CPAN "prefs_dir" configuration client.

    If there is an already file created as defined in "full_path" key, it
    will "warn" and return "undef".

SEE ALSO
    For more details about those programs interact with the smoker and

    specially the part about DistroPrefs.
