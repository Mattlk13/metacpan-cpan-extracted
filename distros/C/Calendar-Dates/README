NAME
    Calendar::Dates - Modules that contain calendar dates

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.1

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.2.3 of Calendar::Dates (from Perl
    distribution Calendar-Dates), released on 2019-06-22.

DESCRIPTION
    The "Calendar::Dates::*" namespace is reserved for modules that provide
    calendar dates using a common interface. The interface is designed to
    be: simple to implement, lightweight, and easy to use and export (e.g.
    to an iCal calendar).

    Conventions for subdivision under the "Calendar::Dates::" namespace:

    *   Country-specific calendars go to <XX>::*, where <XX> is the
        ISO3166-1 2-letter country code

        Examples:

          Calendar::Dates::SG::Events
          Calendar::Dates::SG::FestivalsEvents
          Calendar::Dates::ID::Tax

    *   Country-specific (public) holiday calendars go to <XX>::Holiday::*

        Examples:

         Calendar::Dates::US::Holiday

    *   Region/province- and locality-specific calendars go to
        <CC>::<Name>::*

        Examples:

         Calendar::Dates::ID::Jakarta::Events

    *   Year number can be added as the last component if the module only
        supports a specific year

        Examples:

         Calendar::Dates::ID::Holiday::2019

    *   Religion-related calendars go to Religion::<Name>::*

        Examples:

         Calendar::Dates::Religion::Christianity

    *   Sports-related calendars go to Sports::*

        Examples:

         Calendar::Dates::Sports::WTA
         Calendar::Dates::Sports::WTA::2019
         Calendar::Dates::ID::Jakarta::Sports::Marathon

STATUS
    Draft series (0.x), expected to be stable in 1.0.

METHODS
  get_min_year
    Usage:

     my $min_year = Calendar::Dates::Foo->get_min_year;

    Return the earliest year that the module has dates for. See also
    "get_max_year". Note that the module might not support some years
    between the earliest and latest years.

  get_max_year
    Usage:

     my $max_year = Calendar::Dates::Foo->get_max_year;

    Return the latest year that the module has dates for. See also
    "get_min_year". Note that the module might not support some years
    between the earliest and latest years.

  get_entries
    Usage:

     my $entries = Calendar::Dates::Foo->get_entries([ \%params, ] $year [, $mon [, $day ] ]);

    Return entries for a particular year (or month, or day). Method must die
    if year (or month, or day) is not supported.

    Parameters. The optional %params can be specified for more complex
    querying/filtering. Each calendar module might support different
    parameters, and should die if a parameter is unsupported. Currently
    known common/standardized parameters:

    *   all

        Boolean. If set to true, will include all entries that are normally
        not included, e.g. low-priority entries (entries with tag
        "low-priority").

    *   include_tags

        Array. If set, then only entries which contain all tags mentioned in
        this parameter should be included.

    *   exclude_tags

        Array. If set, then entries which contain any of the tags mentioned
        in this parameter should NOT be included.

    *   q

        String. String/keyword matching. Only include entries that match
        this keyword/string.

    Result. Result is arrayref of entries, where each entry is a DefHash.
    The following keys are recognized, an asterisk ("*") signifies required
    key (see DefHash for more details on each key):

    *   date*

        String. Either ISO8601 date in the form of "YYYY-MM-DD" or
        "YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH:MM", or date interval in the form of
        "YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH:MM/HH:MM".

        Examples:

         2019-02-13
         2019-02-13T07:00
         2019-02-13T07:00/09:00

        Interval that spans day is currently not allowed. You might want to
        create separate entries for each day in the span.

        Timezones are not currently allowed. Dates are assumed in the local
        time zone.

    *   year*

        Integer. Year number (e.g. 2019).

    *   month*

        Integer. Month number (1-12).

    *   day*

        Integer. Day of month number (1-31).

    *   summary

        From DefHash specification. Can be in English or another language,
        but providing English version is recommended. To specify summary in
        other language, use "summary.alt.lang.<LL>" keys.

    *   description

        From DefHash specification. Can be in English or another language,
        but providing English version is recommended. To specify description
        in other language, use "description.alt.lang.<LL>" keys.

    *   tags

        From DefHash specification. Some recommended/known tags: tentative,
        holiday, religious, low-priority (entry with this tag by default
        should not be returned by "get_entries" unless it specifies a true
        "all" option), anniversary (entry with this tag will repeat yearly
        and will be included in every (later) year).

    *   url

        URL.

    *   image_url

        URL.

    *   is_holiday

        Boolean. You can also use tag "holiday" to mark an entry as a
        holiday.

    Optional parameters. A hashref (parameters) can be specified as an
    optional first argument. It can be used to specify in more details what
    kind of entries are requested. For example, a
    Calendar::Dates::AU::Holiday module (Australian holiday calendar)
    contains different holidays for different provinces. User can specify:

     # return 2019 holiday dates for Victoria
     $entries = Calendar::Dates::AU::Holiday->get_entries({province=>'VIC'}, 2019);
