NAME

    Catalyst::Plugin::HTML::Scrubber - Catalyst plugin for
    scrubbing/sanitizing incoming parameters

SYNOPSIS

        use Catalyst qw[HTML::Scrubber];
    
        MyApp->config( 
            scrubber => {
                auto => 1,  # automatically run on request
                ignore_params => [ qr/_html$/, 'article_body' ],
                
                # The following are options to HTML::Scrubber
                params => [
                    default => 0,
                    comment => 0,
                    script => 0,
                    process => 0,
                    allow => [qw [ br hr b a h1]],
                ],
            },
       );

DESCRIPTION

    On request, sanitize HTML tags in all params (with the ability to
    exempt some if needed), to protect against XSS (cross-site scripting)
    attacks and other unwanted things.

EXTENDED METHODS

    setup

      See SYNOPSIS for how to configure the plugin, both with its own
      configuration (e.g. whether to automatically run, whether to exempt
      certain fields) and passing on any options from HTML::Scrubber to
      control exactly what scrubbing happens.

    prepare_parameters

      Sanitize HTML tags in all parameters (unless `ignore_params` exempts
      them).

SEE ALSO

    Catalyst, HTML::Scrubber.
