NAME
    CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee - Calculate the cwalitee of your CPAN Changes
    file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee (from
    Perl distribution CPAN-Changes-Cwalitee), released on 2019-07-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee qw(
         calc_cpan_changes_cwalitee
         list_cpan_changes_cwalitee_indicators
     );

     my $res = calc_cpan_changes_cwalitee(
         path => 'Changes',
     );

DESCRIPTION
    What is CPAN Changes cwalitee? A metric to attempt to gauge the quality
    of your CPAN Changes file. Since actual quality is hard to measure, this
    metric is called a "cwalitee" instead. The cwalitee concept follows
    "kwalitee" [1] which is specifically to measure the quality of CPAN
    distribution. I pick a different spelling to avoid confusion with
    kwalitee. And unlike kwalitee, the unqualified term "cwalitee" does not
    refer to a specific, particular subject. There can be "CPAN Changes
    cwalitee" (which is handled by this module), "module abstract cwalitee",
    and so on.

INTERNAL NOTES
    Indicator priority. At priority 10, Changes file is parsed using
    CPAN::Changes and the result # it put in 'parsed' key.

FUNCTIONS
  calc_cpan_changes_cwalitee
    Usage:

     calc_cpan_changes_cwalitee(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_indicator => *array[str]*

        Do not use these indicators.

    *   exclude_indicator_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Do not use indicators from these modules.

    *   exclude_indicator_status => *array[str]*

        Do not use indicators having these statuses.

    *   include_indicator => *array[str]*

        Only use these indicators.

    *   include_indicator_module => *array[perl::modname]*

        Only use indicators from these modules.

    *   include_indicator_status => *array[str]* (default: ["stable"])

        Only use indicators having these statuses.

    *   min_indicator_severity => *uint* (default: 1)

        Minimum indicator severity.

    *   path* => *pathname*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  list_cpan_changes_cwalitee_indicators
    Usage:

     list_cpan_changes_cwalitee_indicators(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Examples:

    *   List all installed indicators from all modules:

         list_cpan_changes_cwalitee_indicators();

        Result:

         [
           "date_correct_format",

           "has_releases",
           "no_duplicate_version",
           "no_empty_group",

         ]

    *   List only certain names, show details:

         list_cpan_changes_cwalitee_indicators(
         detail  => 1,
           include => ["parsable", "date_parsable", "date_correct_format"]
         );

        Result:

         [
           {

             priority => 50,
             severity => 3,
             status   => "stable",
             summary  => "Dates are specified in the correct specified format, e.g. YYYY-MM-DD",
           },
           {
             module   => "CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee::Core",
             name     => "date_parsable",
             priority => 50,
             severity => 3,
             status   => "stable",
             summary  => "Dates are parsable by CPAN::Changes",
           },
           {
             module   => "CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee::Core",
             name     => "parsable",
             priority => 10,
             severity => 3,
             status   => "stable",
             summary  => "Parseable by CPAN::Changes",
           },
         ]
