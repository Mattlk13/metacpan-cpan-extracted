NAME
    CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee - Calculate the cwalitee of your CPAN Changes
    file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee (from
    Perl distribution CPAN-Changes-Cwalitee), released on 2019-07-03.

SYNOPSIS
     use CPAN::Changes::Cwalitee qw(
         calc_cpan_changes_cwalitee
         list_cpan_changes_cwalitee_indicators
     );

     my $res = calc_cpan_changes_cwalitee(
         path => 'Changes',
     );

DESCRIPTION
    EARLY RELEASE. CURRENTLY ONLY CONTAINS A MINIMUM SET OF INDICATORS.

    What is CPAN Changes cwalitee? A metric to attempt to gauge the quality
    of your CPAN Changes file. Since actual quality is hard to measure, this
    metric is called a "cwalitee" instead. The cwalitee concept follows
    "kwalitee" [1] which is specifically to measure the quality of CPAN
    distribution. I pick a different spelling to avoid confusion with
    kwalitee. And unlike kwalitee, the unqualified term "cwalitee" does not
    refer to a specific, particular subject. There can be "CPAN Changes
    cwalitee" (which is handled by this module), "module abstract cwalitee",
    and so on.
