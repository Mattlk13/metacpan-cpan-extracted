NAME

    Catmandu::Store::RKD - Retrieve items from the RKD

SYNOPSIS

    This module contains two submodules; a fix to lookup a name in
    https://rkd.nl/nl/collecties/overige-databases/open-search-rkdartists|R
    KD, and a store to lookup an artist id (kunstenaarsnummer) in the RKD
    database.

DESCRIPTION

 Catmandu::Fix::rkd_name

    The fix takes a name (first name, last name or a combination) and
    performs a lookup to the RKD artists database. It returns an array of
    results. Every result is of the form:

        {
            'title'       => 'Name of the person',
            'description' => 'Short description, as provided by RKD',
            'artist_link' => 'Link to the artist using the artist id',
            'guid'        => 'Permalink to the record'
        }

    For some names, it can/will return multiple possibilities. You must
    determine yourself which one is the 'correct' one.

 Catmandu::Store::RKD

    The fix takes an artist id (kunstenaarsnummer) and performs a lookup to
    the RKD artists database. It returns an array containing either one or
    no results. Every result is of the form:

        {
            'title'       => 'Name of the person',
            'description' => 'Short description, as provided by RKD',
            'artist_link' => 'Link to the artist using the artist id',
            'guid'        => 'Permalink to the record'
        }
