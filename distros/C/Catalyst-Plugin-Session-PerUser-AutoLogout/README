NAME

    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser::AutoLogout - Log a user out of
    other sessions

DESCRIPTION

    For some reason, you might want to ensure each user is only logged in
    once. This plugin extends Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser and
    automatically removes a user's previous session whenever they log in
    again, thus forcing that other session to end and logging them out.

    You would probably not want to do this, but you might be being paid by
    someone who does want that.
