=head1 NAME

Configd::Language::opendkim - opendkim.conf, which has never had a conf.d.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Configd();

    Configd->adopt('opendkim');
    Configd->build('opendkim');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

opendkim reads one file and offers nothing to add to it. Signing for a second
domain on a host that already signs for one means editing that file, and two
things editing it cannot both win.

The file is 0600 and stays that way: it names the key table and the signing
key, and configd keeps whatever mode it found.

=head1 NAME

Configd::Language::opendkim - opendkim.conf, which has never had a conf.d.
