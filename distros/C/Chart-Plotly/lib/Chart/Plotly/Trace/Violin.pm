# ABSTRACT: In vertical (horizontal) violin plots, statistics are computed using `y` (`x`) values. By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one violin per distinct x (y) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) {array} is provided, a single violin is drawn. That violin position is then positioned with with `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if provided.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * alignmentgroup

Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls whether bars compute their positional range dependently or independently.

=item * bandwidth

Sets the bandwidth used to compute the kernel density estimate. By default, the bandwidth is determined by Silverman's rule of thumb.

=item * box

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * fillcolor

Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available.

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hoveron

Do the hover effects highlight individual violins or sample points or the kernel density estimate or any combination of them?

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Same as `text`.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * jitter

Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn. If *0*, the sample points align along the distribution axis. If *1*, the sample points are drawn in a random jitter of width equal to the width of the violins.

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * line

=item * marker

=item * meanline

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover. For violin traces, the name will also be used for the position coordinate, if `x` and `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and the position axis is categorical. Note that the trace name is also used as a default value for attribute `scalegroup` (please see its description for details).

=item * offsetgroup

Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the same position coordinate will line up.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * orientation

Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If *v* (*h*), the distribution is visualized along the vertical (horizontal).

=item * pointpos

Sets the position of the sample points in relation to the violins. If *0*, the sample points are places over the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values correspond to positions to the right (left) for vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal violins.

=item * points

If *outliers*, only the sample points lying outside the whiskers are shown If *suspectedoutliers*, the outlier points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3 or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see `outliercolor`) If *all*, all sample points are shown If *false*, only the violins are shown with no sample points

=item * scalegroup

If there are multiple violins that should be sized according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by every trace in the same group. If a violin's `width` is undefined, `scalegroup` will default to the trace's name. In this case, violins with the same names will be linked together

=item * scalemode

Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is determined.*width* means each violin has the same (max) width*count* means the violins are scaled by the number of sample points makingup each violin.

=item * selected

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * side

Determines on which side of the position value the density function making up one half of a violin is plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under *overlay* mode, where one trace has `side` set to *positive* and the other to *negative*.

=item * span

Sets the span in data space for which the density function will be computed. Has an effect only when `spanmode` is set to *manual*.

=item * spanmode

Sets the method by which the span in data space where the density function will be computed. *soft* means the span goes from the sample's minimum value minus two bandwidths to the sample's maximum value plus two bandwidths. *hard* means the span goes from the sample's minimum to its maximum value. For custom span settings, use mode *manual* and fill in the `span` attribute.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets the text elements associated with each sample value. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a *text* flag.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * transforms

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * unselected

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * width

Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If *0* (default value) the width is automatically selected based on the positions of other violin traces in the same subplot.

=item * x

Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for more info.

=item * x0

Sets the x coordinate of the box. See overview for more info.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for more info.

=item * y0

Sets the y coordinate of the box. See overview for more info.

=item * yaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
