=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace sankey.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * color

Sets the `node` color. It can be a single value, or an array for specifying color for each `node`. If `node.color` is omitted, then the default `Plotly` color palette will be cycled through to have a variety of colors. These defaults are not fully opaque, to allow some visibility of what is beneath the node.

=item * colorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  color .

=item * description

=item * groups

Groups of nodes. Each group is defined by an array with the indices of the nodes it contains. Multiple groups can be specified.

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear when hovering nodes. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Time-Formatting.md#format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `value` and `label`. Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * label

The shown name of the node.

=item * labelsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  label .

=item * line

=item * pad

Sets the padding (in px) between the `nodes`.

=item * thickness

Sets the thickness (in px) of the `nodes`.

=item * x

The normalized horizontal position of the node.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

The normalized vertical position of the node.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
