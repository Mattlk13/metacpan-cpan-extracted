=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * align

Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines

=item * alignsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  align .

=item * bgcolor

Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace

=item * bgcolorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  bgcolor .

=item * bordercolor

Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace.

=item * bordercolorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  bordercolor .

=item * font

=item * namelength

Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer >3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to `namelength - 3` characters and add an ellipsis.
