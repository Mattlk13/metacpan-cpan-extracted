=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Chart::Plotly qw(show_plot);
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface;
 use English qw(-no_match_vars);
 
 my $surface = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface->new(
     x => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     y => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     z => [
         map {
             my $y = $ARG;
             [ map { $ARG - $y * $y } ( 0 .. 10 ) ]
         } ( 0 .. 10 )

=head1 NAME 

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.

=item * cauto

Determines the whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data.

=item * cmax

Sets the upper bound of color domain.

=item * cmin

Sets the lower bound of color domain.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax

=item * contours

=item * hidesurface

Determines whether or not a surface is drawn. For example, set `hidesurface` to *false* `contours.x.show` to *true* and `contours.y.show` to *true* to draw a wire frame plot.

=item * lighting

=item * lightposition

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the surface.

=item * reversescale

Reverses the colorscale.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * surfacecolor

Sets the surface color values, used for setting a color scale independent of `z`.

=item * text

Sets the text elements associated with each z value.

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates.

=item * z

Sets the z coordinates.

=item * name

Sets the trace name

=back

=head2 type

Trace type.
