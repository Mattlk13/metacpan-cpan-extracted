# ABSTRACT: The data the describes the coordinates of the surface is set in `z`. Data in `z` should be a {2D array}. Coordinates in `x` and `y` can either be 1D {arrays} or {2D arrays} (e.g. to graph parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which should be a {2D array}, where its bounds can be controlled using `cmin` and `cmax`.

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface - The data the describes the coordinates of the surface is set in `z`. Data in `z` should be a {2D array}. Coordinates in `x` and `y` can either be 1D {arrays} or {2D arrays} (e.g. to graph parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which should be a {2D array}, where its bounds can be controlled using `cmin` and `cmax`.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.

=item * cauto

Determines the whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data.

=item * cmax

Sets the upper bound of color domain.

=item * cmin

Sets the lower bound of color domain.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax

=item * contours

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * hidesurface

Determines whether or not a surface is drawn. For example, set `hidesurface` to *false* `contours.x.show` to *true* and `contours.y.show` to *true* to draw a wire frame plot.

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * lighting

=item * lightposition

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the surface.

=item * reversescale

Reverses the colorscale.

=item * scene

Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If *scene* (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If *scene2*, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene2`, and so on.

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * stream

=item * surfacecolor

Sets the surface color values, used for setting a color scale independent of `z`.

=item * surfacecolorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  surfacecolor .

=item * text

Sets the text elements associated with each z value. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * transforms

=item * uid

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * xcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates.

=item * ycalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

=item * z

Sets the z coordinates.

=item * zcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `z` date data.

=item * zsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
