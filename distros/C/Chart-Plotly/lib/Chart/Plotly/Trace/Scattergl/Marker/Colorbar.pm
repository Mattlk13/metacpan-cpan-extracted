To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *n* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*",

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * bgcolor

Sets the color of padded area.

=item * bordercolor

Sets the axis line color.

=item * borderwidth

Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar.

=item * dtick

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *n* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

=item * exponentformat

Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If *none*, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If *e*, 1e+9. If *E*, 1E+9. If *power*, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If *SI*, 1G. If *B*, 1B.

=item * len

Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends.

=item * lenmode

Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot *fraction* or in *pixels. Use `len` to set the value.

=item * nticks

Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to *auto*.

=item * outlinecolor

Sets the axis line color.

=item * outlinewidth

Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

=item * separatethousands

If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated

=item * showexponent

If *all*, all exponents are shown besides their significands. If *first*, only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If *last*, only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If *none*, no exponents appear.

=item * showticklabels

Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.

=item * showtickprefix

If *all*, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If *first*, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If *last*, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If *none*, tick prefixes are hidden.

=item * showticksuffix

Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.

=item * thickness

Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels.

=item * thicknessmode

Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot *fraction* or in *pixels*. Use `thickness` to set the value.

=item * tick0

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

=item * tickangle

Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

=item * tickcolor

Sets the tick color.

=item * tickfont

=item * tickformat

Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Time-Formatting.md#format We add one item to d3's date formatter: *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*

=item * tickformatstops

=item * ticklen

Sets the tick length (in px).

=item * tickmode

Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If *array*, the placement of the ticks is set via `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (*array* is the default value if `tickvals` is provided).

=item * tickprefix

Sets a tick label prefix.

=item * ticks

Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If **, this axis' ticks are not drawn. If *outside* (*inside*), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.

=item * ticksuffix

Sets a tick label suffix.

=item * ticktext

Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to *array*. Used with `tickvals`.

=item * ticktextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ticktext .

=item * tickvals

Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to *array*. Used with `ticktext`.

=item * tickvalssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  tickvals .

=item * tickwidth

Sets the tick width (in px).

=item * title

=item * x

Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction).

=item * xanchor

Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the `x` position to the *left*, *center* or *right* of the color bar.

=item * xpad

Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction.

=item * y

Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction).

=item * yanchor

Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the `y` position to the *top*, *middle* or *bottom* of the color bar.

=item * ypad

Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction.
