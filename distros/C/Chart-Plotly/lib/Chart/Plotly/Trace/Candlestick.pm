# ABSTRACT: The candlestick is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the `open` and `close` values and the lines represent the spread between the `low` and `high` values Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Candlestick - The candlestick is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the `open` and `close` values and the lines represent the spread between the `low` and `high` values Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

 use Chart::Plotly;
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Candlestick;
 my $candlestick = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Candlestick->new(
     x     => [ 1 .. 5 ],
     open  => [ 1, 6, 7 ],

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The candlestick is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the `open` and `close` values and the lines represent the spread between the `low` and `high` values Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * close

Sets the close values.

=item * closesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  close .

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * decreasing

=item * high

Sets the high values.

=item * highsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  high .

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertext

Same as `text`.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * increasing

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * line

=item * low

Sets the low values.

=item * lowsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  low .

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * open

Sets the open values.

=item * opensrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  open .

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets hover text elements associated with each sample point. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to this trace's sample points.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * transforms

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * whiskerwidth

Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box' width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as the box(es).

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates. If absent, linear coordinate will be generated.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * xcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * yaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
