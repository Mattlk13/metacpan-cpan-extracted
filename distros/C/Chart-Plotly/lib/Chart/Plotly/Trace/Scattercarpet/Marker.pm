=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace scattercarpet.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `marker.colorscale`. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

=item * cauto

Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in `marker.color`) or the bounds set in `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`  Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. Defaults to `false` when `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` are set by the user.

=item * cmax

Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in `marker.color` and if set, `marker.cmin` must be set as well.

=item * cmin

Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in `marker.color` and if set, `marker.cmax` must be set as well.

=item * color

Sets themarkercolor. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` if set.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

=item * colorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  color .

=item * gradient

=item * line

=item * maxdisplayed

Sets a maximum number of points to be drawn on the graph. *0* corresponds to no limit.

=item * opacity

Sets the marker opacity.

=item * opacitysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  opacity .

=item * reversescale

Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. If true, `marker.cmin` will correspond to the last color in the array and `marker.cmax` will correspond to the first color.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array.

=item * size

Sets the marker size (in px).

=item * sizemin

Has an effect only if `marker.size` is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points.

=item * sizemode

Has an effect only if `marker.size` is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in `size` is converted to pixels.

=item * sizeref

Has an effect only if `marker.size` is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with `sizemin` and `sizemode`.

=item * sizesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  size .

=item * symbol

Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending *-open* to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending *-dot* to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending *-open-dot* or *dot-open* to a symbol name.

=item * symbolsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  symbol .
