# ABSTRACT: Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the contribution of various elements (either positive or negative) in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the contribution of various elements (either positive or negative) in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls whether bars compute their positional range dependently or independently.

=item * base

Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis units).

=item * cliponaxis

Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.

=item * connector

=item * constraintext

Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to be no larger than the bar itself.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * decreasing

=item * dx

Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.

=item * dy

Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Time-Formatting.md#format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `initial`, `delta` and `final`. Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a *text* flag.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * increasing

=item * insidetextanchor

Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end points in `textposition` *inside* mode.

=item * insidetextfont

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * measure

An array containing types of values. By default the values are considered as 'relative'. However; it is possible to use 'total' to compute the sums. Also 'absolute' could be applied to reset the computed total or to declare an initial value where needed.

=item * measuresrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  measure .

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * offset

Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position axis units). In *group* barmode, traces that set *offset* will be excluded and drawn in *overlay* mode instead.

=item * offsetgroup

Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the same position coordinate will line up.

=item * offsetsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  offset .

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * orientation

Sets the orientation of the bars. With *v* (*h*), the value of the each bar spans along the vertical (horizontal).

=item * outsidetextfont

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textangle

Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. With *auto* the texts may automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size in bars.

=item * textfont

=item * textinfo

Determines which trace information appear on the graph. In the case of having multiple waterfalls, totals are computed separately (per trace).

=item * textposition

Specifies the location of the `text`. *inside* positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated and scaled if needed). *outside* positions `text` outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text gets pushed inside. *auto* tries to position `text` inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar is stacked on this one the text is moved outside.

=item * textpositionsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition .

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * texttemplate

Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Time-Formatting.md#format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `initial`, `delta`, `final` and `label`.

=item * texttemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  texttemplate .

=item * totals

=item * transforms

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * width

Sets the bar width (in position axis units).

=item * widthsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  width .

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * x0

Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting coordinate and `dx` the step.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates.

=item * y0

Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting coordinate and `dy` the step.

=item * yaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
