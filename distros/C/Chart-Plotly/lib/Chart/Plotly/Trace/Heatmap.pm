# ABSTRACT: The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a {2D array} of values (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z` is a {2D array}, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot) and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`. Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1) elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D {array}, the x and y coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to form data triplets.

In the case where `z` is a {2D array}, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot) and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`. Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1) elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D {array}, the x and y coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to form data triplets.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax

=item * connectgaps

Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the `z` data are filled in.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * dx

Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.

=item * dy

Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * reversescale

Reverses the colorscale.

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets the text elements associated with each z value.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * transforms

=item * transpose

Transposes the z data.

=item * uid

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * x0

Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting coordinate and `dx` the step.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * xcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.

=item * xgap

Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * xtype

If *array*, the heatmap's x coordinates are given by *x* (the default behavior when `x` is provided). If *scaled*, the heatmap's x coordinates are given by *x0* and *dx* (the default behavior when `x` is not provided).

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates.

=item * y0

Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting coordinate and `dy` the step.

=item * yaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.

=item * ycalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.

=item * ygap

Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

=item * ytype

If *array*, the heatmap's y coordinates are given by *y* (the default behavior when `y` is provided) If *scaled*, the heatmap's y coordinates are given by *y0* and *dy* (the default behavior when `y` is not provided)

=item * z

Sets the z data.

=item * zauto

Determines the whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data.

=item * zhoverformat

Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. See: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format

=item * zmax

Sets the upper bound of color domain.

=item * zmin

Sets the lower bound of color domain.

=item * zsmooth

Picks a smoothing algorithm use to smooth `z` data.

=item * zsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
