# ABSTRACT: The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use HTML::Show;
 use Chart::Plotly;
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Histogram2d;
 my $histogram2d = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Histogram2d->new( x => [ map { int( 10 * rand() ) } ( 1 .. 500 ) ],
                                                           y => [ map { int( 10 * rand() ) } ( 1 .. 500 ) ] );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * autobinx

Determines whether or not the x axis bin attributes are picked by an algorithm. Note that this should be set to false if you want to manually set the number of bins using the attributes in xbins.

=item * autobiny

Determines whether or not the y axis bin attributes are picked by an algorithm. Note that this should be set to false if you want to manually set the number of bins using the attributes in ybins.

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * histfunc

Specifies the binning function used for this histogram trace. If *count*, the histogram values are computed by counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If *sum*, *avg*, *min*, *max*, the histogram values are computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the maximum of the values lying inside each bin respectively.

=item * histnorm

Specifies the type of normalization used for this histogram trace. If **, the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the number of data points lying inside the bins). If *percent* / *probability*, the span of each bar corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences with respect to the total number of sample points (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If *density*, the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals the total number of sample points). If *probability density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the probability that an event will fall into the corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals 1).

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * marker

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * nbinsx

Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the optimal bin size such that the histogram best visualizes the distribution of the data.

=item * nbinsy

Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the optimal bin size such that the histogram best visualizes the distribution of the data.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * reversescale

Reverses the colorscale.

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * stream

=item * uid

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * x

Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * xbins

=item * xcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.

=item * xgap

Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.

=item * yaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * ybins

=item * ycalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.

=item * ygap

Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

=item * z

Sets the aggregation data.

=item * zauto

Determines the whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data.

=item * zhoverformat

Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. See: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format

=item * zmax

Sets the upper bound of color domain.

=item * zmin

Sets the lower bound of color domain.

=item * zsmooth

Picks a smoothing algorithm use to smooth `z` data.

=item * zsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
