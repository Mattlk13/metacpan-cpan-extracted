=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Chart::Plotly qw(show_plot);
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface;
 use English qw(-no_match_vars);
 
 my $surface = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface->new(
     x => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     y => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     z => [
         map {
             my $y = $ARG;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace surface.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * x

Determines whether or not these contour lines are projected on the x plane. If `highlight` is set to *true* (the default), the projected lines are shown on hover. If `show` is set to *true*, the projected lines are shown in permanence.

=item * y

Determines whether or not these contour lines are projected on the y plane. If `highlight` is set to *true* (the default), the projected lines are shown on hover. If `show` is set to *true*, the projected lines are shown in permanence.

=item * z

Determines whether or not these contour lines are projected on the z plane. If `highlight` is set to *true* (the default), the projected lines are shown on hover. If `show` is set to *true*, the projected lines are shown in permanence.
