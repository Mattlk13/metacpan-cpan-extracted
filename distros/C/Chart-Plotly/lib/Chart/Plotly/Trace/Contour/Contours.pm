=head1 NAME

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Contour::Contours - This attribute is one of the possible options for the trace contour.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.017

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Chart::Plotly qw(show_plot);
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Contour;
 use English qw(-no_match_vars);
 
 my $contour = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Contour->new(
     x => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     y => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     z => [
         map {
             my $y = $ARG;
             [ map { $ARG * $ARG + $y * $y } ( 0 .. 10 ) ]
         } ( 0 .. 10 )
     ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace contour.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * coloring

Determines the coloring method showing the contour values. If *fill*, coloring is done evenly between each contour level If *heatmap*, a heatmap gradient coloring is applied between each contour level. If *lines*, coloring is done on the contour lines. If *none*, no coloring is applied on this trace.

=item * end

Sets the end contour level value. Must be more than `contours.start`

=item * impliedEdits

=item * labelfont

=item * labelformat

Sets the contour label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-language which is very similar to Python, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format.

=item * operation

Sets the constraint operation. *=* keeps regions equal to `value` *<* and *<=* keep regions less than `value` *>* and *>=* keep regions greater than `value` *[]*, *()*, *[)*, and *(]* keep regions inside `value[0]` to `value[1]` *][*, *)(*, *](*, *)[* keep regions outside `value[0]` to value[1]` Open vs. closed intervals make no difference to constraint display, but all versions are allowed for consistency with filter transforms.

=item * showlabels

Determines whether to label the contour lines with their values.

=item * showlines

Determines whether or not the contour lines are drawn. Has an effect only if `contours.coloring` is set to *fill*.

=item * size

Sets the step between each contour level. Must be positive.

=item * start

Sets the starting contour level value. Must be less than `contours.end`

=item * value

Sets the value or values of the constraint boundary. When `operation` is set to one of the comparison values (=,<,>=,>,<=) *value* is expected to be a number. When `operation` is set to one of the interval values ([],(),[),(],][,)(,](,)[) *value* is expected to be an array of two numbers where the first is the lower bound and the second is the upper bound.
