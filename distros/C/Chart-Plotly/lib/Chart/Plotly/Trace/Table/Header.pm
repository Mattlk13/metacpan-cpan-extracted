=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * align

Sets the horizontal alignment of the `text` within the box. Has an effect only if `text` spans more two or more lines (i.e. `text` contains one or more <br> HTML tags) or if an explicit width is set to override the text width.

=item * alignsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  align .

=item * fill

=item * font

=item * format

Sets the cell value formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-language which is similar to those of Python. See https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format

=item * formatsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  format .

=item * height

The height of cells.

=item * line

=item * prefix

Prefix for cell values.

=item * prefixsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  prefix .

=item * suffix

Suffix for cell values.

=item * suffixsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  suffix .

=item * values

Header cell values. `values[m][n]` represents the value of the `n`th point in column `m`, therefore the `values[m]` vector length for all columns must be the same (longer vectors will be truncated). Each value must be a finite number or a string.

=item * valuessrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  values .
