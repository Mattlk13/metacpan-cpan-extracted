=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace parcats.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#parcats>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * categoryarray

Sets the order in which categories in this dimension appear. Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to *array*. Used with `categoryorder`.

=item * categoryarraysrc

Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for `categoryarray`.

=item * categoryorder

Specifies the ordering logic for the categories in the dimension. By default, plotly uses *trace*, which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or *category descending* if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set `categoryorder` to *array* to derive the ordering from the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the *trace* mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in `categoryarray`.

=item * description

=item * displayindex

The display index of dimension, from left to right, zero indexed, defaults to dimension index.

=item * label

The shown name of the dimension.

=item * ticktext

Sets alternative tick labels for the categories in this dimension. Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to *array*. Should be an array the same length as `categoryarray` Used with `categoryorder`.

=item * ticktextsrc

Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for `ticktext`.

=item * values

Dimension values. `values[n]` represents the category value of the `n`th point in the dataset, therefore the `values` vector for all dimensions must be the same (longer vectors will be truncated).

=item * valuessrc

Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for `values`.

=item * visible

Shows the dimension when set to `true` (the default). Hides the dimension for `false`.
