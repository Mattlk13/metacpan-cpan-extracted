NAME
    CPAN::Mini::Devel::Recent - Create CPAN::Mini mirror with recent
    developer releases

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
        $ minicpan -c CPAN::Mini::Devel::Recent

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Mini::Devel::Recent is similar to CPAN::Mini::Devel, except it
    uses the "RECENT-*" index files on CPAN, which are updated more
    frequently than the "indices/find-ls.gz" file that CPAN::Mini::Devel
    uses.

    Normally, CPAN::Mini creates a minimal CPAN mirror with the latest
    version of each distribution, but excluding developer releases (those
    with an underscore in the version number, like 0.10_01).

    CPAN::Mini::Devel::Recent enhances CPAN::Mini to include the latest
    developer and non-developer release in the mirror. For example, if
    Foo-Bar-0.01, Foo-Bar-0.02, Foo-Bar-0.03_01 and Foo-Bar-0.03_02 are on
    CPAN, only Foo-Bar-0.02 and Foo-Bar 0.03_02 will be mirrored. This is
    particularly useful for creating a local mirror for smoke testing.

    Unauthorized releases will also be included if they resemble a
    distribution name already in the normal CPAN packages list.

    There may be errors retrieving very new modules if they are indexed but
    not yet synchronized on the mirror.

USAGE
    See CPAN::Mini.
