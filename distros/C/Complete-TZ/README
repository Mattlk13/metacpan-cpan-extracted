DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  complete_tz_name
    Usage:

     complete_tz_name(%args) -> array

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

        Word to complete.

    Return value: (array)

  complete_tz_offset
    Usage:

     complete_tz_offset(%args) -> array

    Complete from list of existing timezone offsets (in the form of
    -HH:MM(:SS)? or +HH:MM(:SS)?).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

        Word to complete.
