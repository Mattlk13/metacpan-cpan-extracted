NAME

    Crypt::Passphrase::Bcrypt::AES - A peppered AES-encrypted Bcrypt
    encoder for Crypt::Passphrase

SYNOPSIS

     my $passphrase = Crypt::Passphrase->new(
         encoder => {
             module  => 'Bcrypt::AES',
             peppers => {
                 1 => pack('H*', '0123456789ABCDEF...'),
                 2 => pack('H*', 'FEDCBA9876543210...'),
             },
         },
     );

DESCRIPTION

    This class implements peppering by encrypting the hash using AES
    (unlike Crypt::Passphrase::Pepper::Simple which hashes the input
    instead).

 Configuration

    This module takes all arguments also taken by
    Crypt::Passphrase::Bcrypt, with the following additions:

      * peppers

      This is a map of identifier to pepper value. The identifiers should
      be (probably small) numbers, the values should be random binary
      strings that must be either 16, 24 or 32 bytes long.

      * active

      This is the identifier of the active pepper. By default it will be
      the identifier with the highest (numerical) value.

      * mode

      This is the mode that will be used with AES. Values values are 'cfb',
      'ofb' and 'ctr' (the default).

 Supported crypt types

    This supports any sequence of <bcrypt->, (sha256 | sha385 | sha512),
    -encrypted-aes-, (ctr | cfb | ofb). E.g.
    bcrypt-sha384-encrypted-aes-ctr
