NAME
    CGI::AppBuilder - CGI Application Builder

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::AppBuilder;

      my $cg = CGI::AppBuilder->new('ifn', 'my_init.cfg', 'opt', 'vhS:a:');
      my $ar = $cg->get_inputs;

DESCRIPTION
    There are already many application builders out there. Why you need
    another one? Well, if you are already familiar with CGI::Builder or
    CGI::Application, this one will provide some useful methods to you to
    read your configuration file and pre-process your templates. Please read
    on.

   new (ifn => 'file.cfg', opt => 'hvS:')
    Input variables:

      $ifn  - input/initial file name. 
      $opt  - options for Getopt::Std

    Variables used or routines called:

      None

    How to use:

       my $ca = new CGI::AppBuilder;      # or
       my $ca = CGI::AppBuilder->new;     # or
       my $ca = CGI::AppBuilder->new(ifn=>'file.cfg',opt=>'hvS:'); # or
       my $ca = CGI::AppBuilder->new('ifn', 'file.cfg','opt','hvS:');

    Return: new empty or initialized CGI::AppBuilder object.

    This method constructs a Perl object and capture any parameters if
    specified. It creates and defaults the following variables:

      $self->{ifn} = ""
      $self->{opt} = 'hvS:';

HISTORY
    *   Version 0.10

        This version is to extract out the app methods from CGI::Getopt
        class. It was too much for CGI::Getopt to include the start_app,
        end_app, build_html_header, and disp_form methods.

          0.11 Rewrote start_app method so that content-type can be changed.
          0.12 Moved disp_form to CGI::AppBuilder::Form,
               moved build_html_header to CGI::AppBuilder::Header, and 
               imported all the methods in sub-classes into this class.

    *   Version 1.0001

        Removed start_app and end_app to CGI::AppBuilder::Apps module.
