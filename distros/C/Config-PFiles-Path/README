Config::PFiles::Path

Config::PFiles::Path manipulates the parameter file path used by IRAF
"compatible" parameter interfaces (IRAF (of course), CIAO's cxcparam,
MARX's libpfile, INTEGRAL's PIL). The path is composed of two sets of
directories; the first is both user readable and user writeable, the
other is only user readable. The path is kept in the PFILES
environmental variable, and takes the form

  rw1:rw2;ro1:ro2

where directories to the left of the semicolon are user readable and
writeable and those to the right are readable only.
