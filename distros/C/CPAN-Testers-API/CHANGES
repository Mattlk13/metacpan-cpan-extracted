Changelog for CPAN-Testers-API

0.011     2017-05-14 15:59:49+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Added]

    - Added Metabase shim API for old-style CPAN Testers clients. These
      clients will now produce new-style reports that will be processed
      new ways.

0.010     2017-05-14 10:32:18+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Fixed]

    - Changed the "reporter" field which defined the reporter agent name
      to "user_agent" to capitalize on the connotation with HTTP user
      agents.

    - Added some logging for report posts. There's a strange validation
      error being returned that we're trying to track down, but also
      it'd be nice just to have this for future diagnostics.

0.009     2017-05-13 14:44:49+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Fixed]

    - Changed test report format to move the test result into its own
      top-level "result" object. This makes it easier to see what
      information is about the test results and what information is
      about the code distribution.

0.008     2017-05-12 18:21:59+02:00 Europe/Paris

    [Added]

    - Added single test report get API. This works for new-style reports
      only. We will be migrating old-style reports to the new-style
      format soon. Old-style reports will maintain their former ID, so
      everything should work fine.

    [Fixed]

    - Upgraded Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI to 1.13 to fix deprecations
      due to Mojo::File
    - Fixed API website links to point to /v3 API endpointes
    - Fixed test report post to use new schema with auto-serialization.
      This makes our database more consistent.

0.006     2016-12-27 20:05:59-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed index page documentation links (broken in 0.005)

0.005     2016-12-23 22:46:11-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Reorganized OpenAPI spec to include tags for better documentation
      rendering.

    [Other]

    - Improve example upload feed reader.

0.004     2016-12-17 18:28:28-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - /uploads API for querying the CPAN uploads information table. See
      http://api.cpantesters.org/docs/?url=/v1#!/default/uploads for
      details.

    - Upload feeds to get push notifications of new CPAN uploads via
      WebSockets. Subscribe to any /uploads endpoint to get a feed of
      new information from that endpoint.

0.003     2016-11-26 21:10:39-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Introductory information on the root
    - API documentation using Alien::SwaggerUI

0.002     2016-11-20 19:15:28-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added `render_error` helper to reduce boilerplate for error
      reporting.

    - Added `Rexfile` deploy script to deploy the app with
      [Rex](http://rexify.org).

    [Fixed]

    - Reduced the amount of release data transmitted. There were fields
      in the release summary API that aren't important or needed, so
      they were removed. Also, results for development Perl releases are
      no longer included in the API.

    - Disabled the `?since` parameter when querying all release summary
      data. This feature causes the database query to be too slow:
      Fetching all the data takes about a minute, fetching only the last
      day's worth of data takes hours before it times out.

0.001     2016-11-19 16:51:52-06:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release. This module is a JSON API for CPAN Testers data
      using Mojolicious and CPAN::Testers::Schema.
