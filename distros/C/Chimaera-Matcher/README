Chimaera

A simple but surprisingly effective piece of code to meet the highly
specialised needs of a group of scientists studying bovine T-Cell Receptor
repertoire variability.

Essentially the PCR and sequencing steps involved in library development seem
to result in a significant number of sequences that look like chimaeric artifacts
derived from pairs of real sequences. The presence of these chimaeric sequences
cause problems in processing the data sets.

This code will take an input sequence and compare it against pairs of
known and confirmed haplotype sequences to see if the test sequence
might be derived from a splicing of the two. This allows users to filter
their sequences down to sets of apparently real, unique sequences.
