        Added code and tests to ensure that the constructor throws an exception 
        if the two haplotypes supplied are identical.
        Added a test to ensure that possible_chimaera() reports
        false if there is a mismatch between test sequence and the supplied
        haplotype sequences.
        Added code and tests to ensure that test sequences identical to one
        or other haplotype are NOT reported as possible chimaeric sequences.

        mistake.
