Crypt::Sodium::XS - perl XS bindings for libsodium

NOTE: This distribution is new and should be considered experimental. Not
recommended for "production" use. The API is subject to change, though every
effort will be made not to introduce breaking changes without very good reason.
There are likely bugs and undesirable behaviors yet to be discovered.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make install

The default method of installation will attempt to detect a recent enough
version of libsodium headers on your system or fall back to a bundled version
of libsodium. You should prefer to install libsodium via your operating
system's package manager (be sure to install the "development" package) before
building this dist. If you instead fall back to the bundled libsodium, keep in
mind that it cannot be kept up to date without updating this perl package. The
bundled libsodium is distributed in its original form along with its OpenPGP
signature file. You are encouraged to manually check its signature.

You may prevent the automatic libsodium detection (forcing the use of the
bundled version) by setting the environment variable SODIUM_BUNDLED to any
true (perl's perspective) value.

  SODIUM_BUNDLED=1 cpanm Crypt::Sodium::XS

If you prefer to use libsodium from a non-standard location or with special
linker options, you may set the C<SODIUM_INC> and/or C<SODIUM_LIBS> environment
variables. This will override the detection of libsodium and explicitly use the
given arguments. You should ensure the version of libsodium you intend to use
is the same as the bundled lib or higher. Older versions *may* work, but no
promises. For example, with libsodium installed in /opt/sodium you may want
something like:

  SODIUM_INC="-I/opt/sodium/include" \
  SODIUM_LIBS="-L/opt/sodium/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/opt/sodium/lib" \
  cpanm Crypt::Sodium::XS
