NAME
    Carp::Patch::Config - Set some Carp variables

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of Carp::Patch::Config (from Perl
    distribution Carp-Patch-Config), released on 2019-12-09.

SYNOPSIS
     % perl -MCarp::Patch::Config=-MaxArgNums,20,-Dump,1 -d:Confess ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is not so much a "patch" for Carp, but just a convenient way to set
    some Carp package variables from the command-line. Currently can set
    these variables: "MaxArgLen", "MaxArgNums".

PATCH CONTENTS
PATCH CONFIGURATION
    *   -Dump => str

        This is not an actual configuration for Carp, but a shortcut for:

         # when value is 0
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = undef;
 
         # when value is 1
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = sub {
             require Data::Dmp;
             Data::Dmp::dmp($_[0]);
         };
 
         # when value is 2
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = sub {
             require Data::Dump;
             Data::Dump::dump($_[0]);
         };

    *   -MaxArgLen => int

    *   -MaxArgNums => int
