NAME
    Carp::Patch::Config - Set some Carp variables

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of Carp::Patch::Config (from Perl
    distribution Carp-Patch-Config), released on 2022-02-06.

SYNOPSIS
     % perl -MCarp::Patch::Config=-MaxArgNums,20,-Dump,1 -d:Confess ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is not so much a "patch" for Carp, but just a convenient way to set
    some Carp package variables from the command-line. Currently can set
    these variables: "MaxArgLen", "MaxArgNums".

PATCH CONTENTS
PATCH CONFIGURATION
    *   -Dump => str

        This is not an actual configuration for Carp, but a shortcut for:

         # when value is 0 or 'none'
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = undef;
 
         # when value is 1 or 'Data::Dmp'
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = sub {
             require Data::Dmp;
             Data::Dmp::dmp($_[0]);
         };
 
         # when value is 2 or 'Data::Dump'
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = sub {
             require Data::Dump;
             Data::Dump::dump($_[0]);
         };
 
         # when value is 3 or 'Data::Dump::ObjectAsString'
         $Carp::RefArgFormatter = sub {
             require Data::Dump::ObjectAsString;
             Data::Dump::ObjectAsString::dump($_[0]);
         };

    *   -MaxArgLen => int

    *   -MaxArgNums => int

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
