CXC::Form::Tiny::Plugin::OptArgs2

"CXC::Form::Tiny::Plugin::OptArgs2" is a Form::Tiny plugin which make it
easier to use Form::Tiny to validate command line options and arguments
parsed by OptArgs2.

It provides new keywords to be used alongside Form::Tiny's "form_field"
keyword to specify OptArgs2 options and arguments and link them to
Form::Tiny fields.

It adds a method to the form's class which returns the OptArgs2
compatible "optargs" specification and another which sets the form's
input from the output of OptArgs2's "optargs" and "class_optargs"
functions.
