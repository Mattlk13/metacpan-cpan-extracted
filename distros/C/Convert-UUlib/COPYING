This interface is distributed under the same license as perl itself, i.e.
either the Artistic License (COPYING.Artistic) or the GPL (COPYING.GNU).

The uulib library itself (see the subdirectory uulib) is distributed under
the GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (COPYING.GNU). Depending on how you use and
distribute it, this makes the whole package fall under the GPL.

At least some parts of the uulib library are licensed differently:

uulib/ecb.h	distributed unter GPL, to be in line with uulib.
uulib/crc32.c	3-clause BSD, adapted from cyrus, see the file for details
