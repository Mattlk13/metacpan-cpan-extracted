    Usage:

     complete_spanel_site(%args) -> array

    Complete from a list of sites in /home/spanel/site (/s).

    Root will be able to read the content of this directory. Thus, when run

        "_.example.com") while 2 means to return it converting "_" to "*",
        e.g. "*.example.com".

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")
