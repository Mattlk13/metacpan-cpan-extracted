SYNOPSIS

    By default files larger than 10MB will be skipped:

     % minicpan -c CPAN::Mini::NoLargeFiles ...

    To specify size:

     % MAX_FILE_SIZE=20000000 minicpan -c CPAN::Mini::NoLargeFiles ...

DESCRIPTION

    There are files uploaded to CPAN that are quite large (over 100MB). For
    those like me who are often on a limited mobile data plan, or using a
    miniscule-sized SSD, this CPAN::Mini subclass might be useful.

    This is a thin wrapper for LWP::UserAgent::Patch::FilterMirrorMaxSize,
    so instead of:

     % PERL5OPT="-MLWP::UserAgent::Patch::FilterMirrorMaxSize=-size,10485760,-verbose,1" minicpan ...

    you can just do:

     % cpan -c CPAN::Mini::NoLargeFiles ...

FAQ

 How to mix with other subclasses (e.g. I also want to use
 CPAN::Mini::LatestDistVersion)

    Use the patch directly instead of this subclass (see Description).
