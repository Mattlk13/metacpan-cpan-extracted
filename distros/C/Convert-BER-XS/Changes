Revision history for Perl extension Convert::BER::XS

TODO: indefinite length encoding for constructed values
TODO: max_depth? yes max_size? no...

1.11 Tue Apr 23 22:16:20 CEST 2019
	- multibyte lengths were not properly encoded when they contained
          embedded 0 bytes.
        - length 0x7f wasn't encoded in minimum number of bytes.
        - lengths larger than 4 byte caused buffer overruns during encoding
          (e.g. string lengths >= 2**32 bytes).
	- tweaked ber_dump output.
        - slight code tweaks and optimisations.
        - documentation proofread (Stefan Traby).
        - add t/05_bugs.t and t/06_snmp.t.
        - checked, and I think we don't leak memory on errors.

1.1  Sun Apr 21 13:58:00 CEST 2019
	- added ber_dump helper function, for debugging. Kind of regretting
          not having used an OO interface for it, or the other ber_ functions,
          but that's how it is.
        - check for overflow in "w" and INTEGER format decoding and reject
          out-of-range numbers.
        - improved(?) error messages.
        - fix tests failing on 3 2bit perls because I miscounted the number
          of tests to skip :/. Boy is it hard to get a 32 bit perl these days.
        - added some longer testcases.

1.0  Sat Apr 20 23:07:32 CEST 2019
	- API seems stable enough.
	- add ber_decode_prefix.
        - fixed first component OID encoding.
        - reject all kinds of illegal padding.
        - add X.690 / RFC 2578 references to errors, when applicable.
        - add SNMP_GAUGE32 alias.

0.9  Sat Apr 20 17:48:15 CEST 2019
	- I always forget the (void) prototype in C.
        - rename CONSTRUCTED to FLAGS and make it multi-valued.
        - there is no ASN_INTEGER32 type, that's an SNMP thing, Nuke.
        - documented and cleaned up export tags and constants.
        - major cleanup of tghe overall documentation.
        - fixed :encode/:decode tags.
        - fixed synopsis.
        - allow 64 bits for OID components and tags if perl supports them.
        - allow up to 8 octet lengths (2**64 bytes), provided
          perl supports 64 bit.
        - ber_is_int/ber_int now handle 65 bits (IV + UV).

0.8  Sat Apr 20 15:48:21 CEST 2019
	- confidence rises after some sleeping and fixing.
	- add some basic tests.
	- ported it down to 5.8.9.
        - some portability fixes and give some allowance to non-C99
          compilers.
        - fix an out-of-bounds access when creating profiles.
        - fixed boolean/null decoding.
        - fixed out of boundas access when decoidng even-length oid
          components. yup.
        - fixed ObjectDescriptor type mapping,
        - fixed ENUMERATED type mapping.

0.7  Sat Apr 20 03:31:51 CEST 2019
	- profile support, no longer are snmp types hardcoded.
        - much improved documentation.
        - all types except REAL implemented.

0.2  Fri Apr 19 22:41:16 CEST 2019
	- release early, release often.
	- more useful documentation.
        - tune ber_is_xxx functions to be more useful.

0.1  Fri Apr 19 21:46:05 CEST 2019
	- add experimental encoder.
        - add some minimal documentation.

0.0  Fri Apr 19 17:55:27 CEST 2019
	- cloned from an unfinished version of Net::SNMP:XS 2.0.
