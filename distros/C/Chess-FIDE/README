Chess-FIDE

   Chess::FIDE - Perl extension for FIDE Rating List. FIDE is the
International Chess Federation that releases a list of its rated 
members every month. The list contains about five hundred thousand 
entries. This module is designed to parse its contents and to search
across it using perl expressions. A sample from an up-to-date FIDE 
list is provided in t/data/test-list-2.txt, while the older list 
sample is still available in t/data/test-list.txt

   Since version 1.20, a sample utility 'fidesearch' 
(installs to /usr/local/bin) is provided as well.
