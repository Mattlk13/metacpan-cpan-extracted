NAME

    Convert::Color::XTerm - indexed colors used by XTerm

SYNOPSIS

    Directly:

       use Convert::Color::XTerm;
    
       my $red = Convert::Color::XTerm->new( 1 );

    Via Convert::Color:

       use Convert::Color;
    
       my $cyan = Convert::Color->new( 'xterm:14' );

DESCRIPTION

    This subclass of Convert::Color::RGB8 provides lookup of the colors
    that xterm uses by default. Note that the module is not intelligent
    enough to actually parse the XTerm configuration on a machine, nor to
    query a running terminal for its actual colors. It simply implements
    the colors that are present as defaults in the XTerm source code.

    It implements the complete 256-color model in XTerm. This range
    consists of:

      * 0-7: The basic VGA colors, dark intensity. 7 is a "dark" white,
      i.e. a light grey.

      * 8-15: The basic VGA colors, light intensity. 8 represents a "light"
      black, i.e. a dark grey.

      * 16-231: A 6x6x6 RGB color cube.

      Since version 0.06: This can also be specified as rgb(R,G,B) where
      each of R, G and B can be 0 to 5, or 0% to 100%.

      * 232-255: 24 greyscale ramp.

      Since version 0.06: This can also be specified as grey(GREY), where
      GREY is 0 to 23, or 0% to 100%.
