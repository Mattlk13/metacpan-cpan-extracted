NAME

    Circle::Net::Matrix - use Circle as a Matrix client

SYNOPSIS

    On the global tab:

     /networks add -type matrix Matrix

    On the newly-added "Matrix" tab:

     /set homeserver example.com
     /set user_id @me:example.com
     /set access_token MDAxABCDE...
    
     /connect

    (for now you'll have to log in and steal and access token from another
    Matrix client; for example App::MatrixTool).
