SYNOPSIS

    In lib/Your/Class.pm:

     package Your::Class;
     use Class::Accessor::Array {
         accessors => {
             foo => 0,
             bar => 1,
         },
     };

    In code that uses your class:

     use Your::Class;
    
     my $obj = Your::Class->new;
     $obj->foo(1980);
     $obj->bar(12);

    $obj is now:

     bless([1980, 12], "Your::Class");
