NAME
    Class::Accessor::Array - Generate accessors/constructor for array-based
    object

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.032 of Class::Accessor::Array (from
    Perl distribution Class-Accessor-Array), released on 2021-08-03.

SYNOPSIS
    In lib/Your/Class.pm:

     package Your::Class;
     use Class::Accessor::Array {
         # constructor => 'new',
         accessors => {
             foo => 0,
             bar => 1,
         },
     };

    In code that uses your class:

     use Your::Class;

     my $obj = Your::Class->new;
     $obj->foo(1980);
     $obj->bar(12);

    or:

     my $obj = Your::Class->new(foo => 1, bar => 2);

    $obj is now:

     bless([1980, 12], "Your::Class");

    To subclass, in lib/Your/Subclass.pm:

     package Your::Subclass;
     our @ISA = qw(Your::Class);
     use Class::Accessor::Array {
         accessors => {
             baz => 2,
         },
     };

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a builder for array-backed classes.

    You can change the constructor name from the default "new" using the
    "constructor" parameter.

    Currently the built constructor does not accept parameters to set the
    attributes, e.g.:

     my $obj = Your::Class->new(foo=>1, bar=>2); # not supported

    You have to set the attributes manually:

     # supported
     my $obj = Your::Class->new;
     $obj->foo(1);
     $obj->bar(2);

    If you subclass from another class that uses Class::Accessor::Array, you
    must make sure that: 1) the parent class' constructor is "new"; 2) you
    choose attribute array indices that have not already been used (unless
    you deliberately want to share storage space with attributes existing in
    the parent class). Multiple inheritance is not supported.

    Note that if you're looking to reduce memory storage usage, an object
    based on Perl array is not that much-more-space-efficient compared to
    the hash-based object. Try representing an object as a pack()-ed string
    instead using Class::Accessor::PackedString.
