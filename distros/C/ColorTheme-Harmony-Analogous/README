NAME
    ColorTheme::Harmony::Analogous - Create theme with colors equidistant in
    hue

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of ColorTheme::Harmony::Analogous
    (from Perl distribution ColorTheme-Harmony-Analogous), released on
    2020-06-19.

DESCRIPTION
    This color theme has a central color (e.g. for 5 colors, "color3") with
    the hue of *central_h*. Half of the other colors are on the left in the
    color wheel, with equal distance of *h_distance*, while the other half
    are on the right. The colors will have the same saturation and
    brightness.

    Example, for 5 colors, *central_h* of 120 (green) and *h_distance* of 35
    then "color3" will have hue 120, "color2" 90, "color1" 60, "color4" 150,
    "color5" 180. You can see this on the terminal with:

     % show-color-theme-swatch Harmony::Analogous=central_h,120,h_distance,35,s,0.8
