# NAME

winja - dirty patch for handling pathname on MSWin32::Ja\_JP.cp932

# DESCRIPTION

winja is a module which works only on Win32-Japanese-Edition
( a.k.a. Win32-CP932-Edition. But not Cygwin ).
This module works to deal with file path which contains
multibytes letter including 0x5C byte correctly.

See `winja::JP`(described in Japanese) for details.

This module is unnecessary for users besides Win32-Japanese-Edition.

You can not install this module to Perl on non-MSWin32-Japanese-Edition.

Even if you forcibly install this module on non-MSWin32 OS or MSWin32 which is not Japanese-Edition, you can not load this module (OS and Windows default language are checked).
