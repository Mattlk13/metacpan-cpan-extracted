        + Doc : Added a few caveats.
        + Doc : POD quirks.
        + Fix : scripts/func.pl wasn't printing all the functions it found, so
                all those core functions were not listed (and hence handled) :
                  chomp dbmopen endprotoent flock gethostbyaddr getnetent
                  getprotobynumber getservbyport index local my printf recv
                  rmdir sethostent setsockopt socketpair symlink tied untie
        + Fix : Missing 'cmp' operator in the exclude list.
        + Fix : A wrapped core function call wrongly resulted into a method call
                when repeated at least two times.
