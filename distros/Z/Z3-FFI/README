Z3::FFI

This is a direct translation of the Z3 C API to a Perl API. It's most
likely not the level for working with Z3 from perl.

This is a mostly functional implementation right now. Three functions
related to fixed point math are unimplemented currently.

It should work for any examples from the C API in Z3.

INSTALLATION

This is a Perl module distribution. It should be installed with whichever
tool you use to manage your installation of Perl, e.g. any of

  cpanm .
  cpan  .
  cpanp -i .

Consult http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for further instruction.
Should you wish to install this module manually, the procedure is

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

LICENSE

The bindings themselves are distributed under the Artistic 2.0 license.
However the tests and related helper library are based heavily on a
translation of the z3 C API examples, which are distrubed by Microsoft
under the MIT license. As such the code under t/ is distributed under
the MIT license also.

I will also state that I am not entirely sure if it should be me or
Microsoft on the above notice for the files under t/, as they are
rewritten to work with the Z3::FFI bindings in a new language with
additional checks and functionality rather than the original C code.
