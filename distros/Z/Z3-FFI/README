Z3::FFI

This is a direct translation of the Z3 C API to a Perl API. It's most
likely not the level for working with Z3 from perl.

This is a mostly functional implementation right now. Three functions
related to fixed point math are unimplemented currently.

It should work for any examples from the C API in Z3.

INSTALLATION

This is a Perl module distribution. It should be installed with whichever
tool you use to manage your installation of Perl, e.g. any of

  cpanp -i .

Consult http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for further instruction.
