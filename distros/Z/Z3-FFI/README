Z3::FFI

This is a direct translation of the Z3 C API to a Perl API. It's most
likely not the level for working with Z3 from perl.

This is a mostly functional implementation right now. A few functions
are not implemented, Z3_set_error_handler in particular. This early
release is also missing support for any Z3_...[] array types and the few
pointer types that get used. These will be implemented in future
versions
