0.605	2020-09-15

 - Make use of MooX::Press::make_absolute_package_name().

0.604	2020-09-15

 - Factor out a lot of code for run-time modification of packages (which
   happens in hooks) to MooX::Press, allowing code to be shared with
   Zydeco::Lite.

0.603	2020-09-12

 - The `include` keyword now loads *.zydeco.pm files instead of *.pl files.

0.602	2020-09-11

 - Added: Make $factory variable available within `has` defaults, `method`
   bodies, `multi method` bodies, and method modifier bodies.

0.601	2020-09-04

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - The `blessed` and `confess` functions weren't being exported correctly.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Improvements to the structs.pl example.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: The `coerce` and `factory` keywords now work within `after_apply`
   and `before_apply` hooks.

0.600	2020-09-03

 - Protect lexical attributes and methods with Internals::SvREADONLY. This
   is almost certainly what you want.

0.521	2020-09-02

 - Make = shortcut for method bodies smarter at deciding when to optimize
   and when it needs to properly close over variables.

0.520	2020-09-02

 [ Packaging ]
 - Use the latest version of MooX::Press.

 [ Other ]
 - Automatically import types into the caller package for each new class
   and role as it is defined.

0.519	2020-08-25

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document :coerce / :coercion.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Use the latest version of MooX::Press.

0.518	2020-04-08

 [ Documentation ]

0.517	2020-04-08

 [ Packaging ]
 - Use the latest version of MooX::Press.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Support `multi factory` for classes.

0.516	2020-03-24

 [ Packaging ]

0.515	2020-03-24

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix for parsing factory/via statements.

0.514	2020-03-03

 - Allow bare sigils in signature list.
 - Attributes like :lvalue on methods are now passed through to MooX::Press
   (though MooX::Press currently does nothing with them).

0.513	2020-03-03

 [ Packaging ]
 - If it is detected that Variable::Magic is installed, make sure it's
   up-to-date. (I believe older versions are causing problems with
   B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS and causing test fails.)

0.512	2020-03-02

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Output installed module versions for many dependencies.

0.511	2020-02-28

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require newer PPR.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Abbreviated syntax for defining methods, multi methods, factory
   methods, coercions, and method modifiers.
 - Added: Allow comments within type constraints within signatures, but
   only on Perl 5.16+.

0.510	2020-02-24

 [ Documentation ]
 - Start totally rewriting documentation.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require MooX::Press 0.057.

 [ Other ]
 - Default to 'ro' accessors.

0.509	2020-02-20

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - More reliable parsing of aliases for multimethod candidates.
 - Syntax rewrite in version 0.100 accidentally made the optional block
   after a coercion declaration required. It is now optional again.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Remove pod from MooX::Pression stub module.

 [ Other ]
 - Allow a lot of keywords to appear in `begin`, `end`, `after_apply`, and
   `before apply` hooks which previously did not work.

 - Added: Provide `before_apply` and `after_apply` hooks for roles using
   Role::Hooks.
 - Allow `begin` and `end` to be used multiple times in a class/role.

0.507	2020-02-17

 - Cope when Zydeco is imported into the same package twice (but blow up if
   it's also the same lexical scope.).

 - Public attributes may now have private accessors and delegations.

0.505	2020-02-16

0.502	2020-02-15
