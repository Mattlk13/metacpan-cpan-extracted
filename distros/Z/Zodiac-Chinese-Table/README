DESCRIPTION

    This module can look up Chinese zodiac for a given Gregorian date.
    Compared to Zodiac::Chinese, it uses a lookup table (currently
    available for years 1924-2043) so it is more accurate.

    Data source is currently at: https://github.com/perlancar/gudangdata
    (table/chinese_zodiac), which in turn is parsed from Wikipedia article.

FUNCTIONS

     ["start_date", "end_date", "yin_yang", "element", "heavenly_stem", "earthly_branch", "zh_animal", "en_animal"].
