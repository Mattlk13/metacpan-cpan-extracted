DESCRIPTION
    This module can look up Chinese zodiac for a given Gregorian date.
    Compared to Zodiac::Chinese, it uses a lookup table (currently available
    for Jan 1900 - Feb 2092) so it is more accurate.

    Data source is currently at: https://github.com/perlancar/gudangdata
    (table/chinese_zodiac), which in turn is parsed from Wikipedia article.

FUNCTIONS
  chinese_zodiac($date) => arrayref
    Return Chinese zodiac information for a Gregorian date $date. Currently
    date must be a string in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD". Will return an
    arrayref containing these elements:

     # index: 0         1           2           3              4               5               6            7
     ["start_date", "end_date", "yin_yang", "element", "heavenly_stem", "earthly_branch", "zh_animal", "en_animal"].

    Will return undef if date range is unsupported.
