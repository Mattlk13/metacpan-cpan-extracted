NAME
    JavaScript::Any - evaluate some javascript using the best available
    Javascript implementation

SYNOPSIS
      use JavaScript::Any qw( jseval );
  
      my $sum = jseval('1 + 2');   # 3

    Or:

      use JavaScript::Any;
  
      my $context = JavaScript::Any->new_context;
      $context->define( say => sub { print @_, "\n" } );
      $context->eval('say(1 + 2)');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a thin wrapper around JavaScript::V8, JavaScript::Duktape,
    and JE, allowing you to evaluate strings of Javascript code from Perl.

  Status
    This is a very early alpha version. The API still needs documenting and
    cleaning up a lot.

    In particular, the API for defining custom Javascript functions exposes
    differences between the alternative Javascript implementations. Future
    versions of JavaScript::Any will smooth some of these out.

  Functional Interface
    This module can export one function. It is not exported by default.

    `jseval($str)`
        Evaluates the string of Javascript in a fresh context and returns the
        result.

  Object-Oriented Interface
    For more advanced features, use the object-oriented interface.

    `JavaScript::Any->new_context(%opts)`
        Factory method returning an object which implements the
        JavaScript::Any::Context API.
