NAME
    JSON::Color - Encode to colored JSON

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.130 of JSON::Color (from Perl
    distribution JSON-Color), released on 2020-06-09.

SYNOPSIS
     use JSON::Color qw(encode_json);
     say encode_json([1, "two", {three => 4}]);

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates JSON, colorized with ANSI escape sequences.

    To change the color, see the %theme in the source code. In theory you
    can also modify it to colorize using HTML.

FUNCTIONS
  encode_json($data, \%opts) => STR
    Encode to JSON. Will die on error (e.g. when encountering non-encodeable
    data like Regexp or file handle).

    Known options:

    *   color_theme => STR

        Pick a color theme, which is a ColorTheme-confirming color theme
        module. The default is JSON::Color::ColorTheme::default. For
        example: ColorTheme::Lens::Lighten

    *   pretty => BOOL (default: 0)

        Pretty-print.

    *   linum => BOOL (default: 0)

        Show line number.

    *   sort_by => CODE

        If specified, then sorting of hash keys will be done using this sort
        subroutine. This is similar to the "sort_by" option in the JSON
        module. Note that code is executed in "JSON::Color" namespace,
        example:

         # reverse sort
         encode_json(..., {sort_by => sub { $JSON::Color::b cmp $JSON::Color::a }});

        Another example, using Sort::ByExample:

         use Sort::ByExample cmp => {-as => 'by_eg', example => [qw/foo bar baz/]};
         encode_json(..., {sort_by => sub { by_eg($JSON::Color::a, $JSON::Color::b) }});

FAQ
  What about loading?
    Use JSON.

  How to handle non-encodeable data?
    Use Data::Clean::JSON.

  Why do numbers become strings?
    Example:

     % perl -MJSON::Color=encode_json -E'say encode_json([1, "1"])'
     ["1","1"]

    To detect whether a scalar is a number (e.g. differentiate between "1"
    and 1), the XS module Scalar::Util::LooksLikeNumber is used. This is set
    as an optional prerequisite, so you'll need to install it separately.
    After the prerequisite is installed:

     % perl -MJSON::Color=encode_json -E'say encode_json([1, "1"])'
     [1,"1"]

ENVIRONMENT
  JSON_COLOR_COLOR_THEME
    Set default color theme. Has precedence over "COLOR_THEME".

  COLOR_THEME
    Set default color theme.

SEE ALSO
    To colorize with HTML, you can try Syntax::Highlight::JSON.

    Syntax::SourceHighlight can also colorize JSON/JavaScript to HTML or
    ANSI escape. It requires the GNU Source-highlight library.
