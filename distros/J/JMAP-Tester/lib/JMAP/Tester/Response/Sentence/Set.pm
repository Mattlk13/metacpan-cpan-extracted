JMAP::Tester::Response::Sentence::Set - the kind of sentence you get in reply to a setFoos call

=head1 VERSION

version 0.103

=head1 OVERVIEW

A "Set" sentence is a kind of L<Sentence|JMAP::Tester::Response::Sentence>
for representing C<foosSet> results.  It has convenience methods for getting

=head1 PERL VERSION

This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work
on any version of perl released in the last five years.

for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
the minimum required perl.
