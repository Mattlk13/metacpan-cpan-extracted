NAME
    JSON::Decode::Regexp - JSON parser as a single Perl Regex

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.102 of JSON::Decode::Regexp (from Perl
    distribution JSON-Decode-Regexp), released on 2021-08-01.

SYNOPSIS
     use JSON::Decode::Regexp qw(from_json);
     my $data = from_json(q([1, true, "a", {"b":null}]));

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a packaging of Randal L. Schwartz' code (with some
    modification) originally posted at:

     http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=995856

    The code is licensed "just like Perl".

CONTRIBUTOR

FUNCTIONS
  from_json($str) => DATA
    Decode JSON in $str. Dies on error.

FAQ
  How does this module compare to other JSON modules on CPAN?
    As of version 0.04, performance-wise this module quite on par with
    JSON::PP (faster on strings and longer arrays/objects, slower on simpler
    JSON) and a bit slower than JSON::Tiny. And of course all three are much
    slower than XS-based modules like JSON::XS.

    JSON::Decode::Regexp does not yet support Unicode, and does not pinpoint
    exact location on parse error.

    In general, I don't see a point in using it in production (I recommend
    instead JSON::XS or Cpanel::JSON::XS if you can use XS modules, or
    JSON::Tiny if you must use pure Perl modules). But it is a cool hack
    that demonstrates the power of Perl regular expressions and beautiful
    code.
