ABSTRACT

    This software has been developed for use promotion of JIS X 0213.

    JIS X 0213 contains almost all of the characters used in everyday life in
    Japan. In addition, JIS X 0213 was designed with consideration for use
    in Shift_JIS environment. However, because it did not consider CP932, it
    is not very popular.

    "JIS X 0213 bridge" needs last one meter.

    To solve the problem, jacode4e.pl proposes CP932X [shi:pi:kju:san'nikai].

    CP932X implements JIS X 0213 over CP932.

    We can continue to use CP932 data, application programs, databases, and
    networks using CP932X.

    This software doesn't support JIPS(J) and JIPS(E) officially. Because I
    have no official documents about JIPS(J) and JIPS(E) by NEC Corporation.

    This software can convert the following encodings to each other.
