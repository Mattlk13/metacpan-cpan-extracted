    Jq == <<<cpan-head>>>

SYNOPSIS

     my @inc = jq '.' @INC; my $paths = jq 'keys' \%INC; 

DESCRIPTION

    Jq is a data language for querying and manipulating JSON data. It takes
    JSON as input; queries and manipulates; and then prints JSON as output.

    Jq.pm is a Perl module binding to Jq. It's inputs and outputs are Perl
    data abjects that can be represented as JSON.

STATUS

    The current version of Jq uses IPC::Run to invoke your local jq binary.
    This is an API compatible workaround until we can get the XS bindings
    working.
