NAME

    JSON::LD - Load and dump JSON files

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use JSON::LD;
    
     DumpFile("foo.json", { a => 1 });
     my $data - LoadFile("foo.json:");

DESCRIPTION

    Ever want to load JSON from a file? Ever forget which module it is that
    you are supposed to be using now? Is it JSON or JSON::PP or JSON::XS or
    JSON::Syck or Cpanel::JSON::XS (how many Ns are in Cpanel? For some
    reason I am bad at spelling) or JSON::MaybeXS or
    JSON::XS::TheNextForkBecausePreviousMaintainerTurnedOutToBeADouche.
    Which file mode are you supposed to be using again? It's UTF-8 but I
    think I'm supposed to read it as binary? I forget and I have a headache
    now.

    This module is for you. It uses a similar interface to YAML for loading
    and dumping files.

FUNCTIONS

    All functions are exported by default.

 DumpFile

     DumpFile($filename, $data);

    Dumps the data in $data to $filename as properly encoded JSON. If $data
    cannot be represented as JSON or if there is an IO error it will throw
    an exception.

 LoadFile

     my $data = LoadFile($filename);

    Loads the data in JSON format from $filename. If the JSON in $filename
    is not properly formatted or encoded or if there is an IO error it will
    throw an exception.

CAVEATS

    This module is a parody. However the struggle is real.
