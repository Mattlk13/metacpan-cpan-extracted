NAME
    no::warnings - suppress certain warnings for a dynamic scope

SYNOPSIS
    Load the module:

      use no::warnings;

    Disable all warnings for a dynamic scope:

      my $result = no::warnings sub {
        ...;
      };

    Disable specific warnings for a dynamic scope:

      my $result = no::warnings qr/.../, qr/.../, sub {
        ...;
      };

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a function called `no::warnings` which takes a
    coderef optionally preceded by a list of things to match.

    If no list is provided, it will run the coderef, ignoring any warnings
    that would have otherwise been printed to STDERR, and returns the result
    of the coderef.

    If a list of warnings to ignore is provided, it will run the coderef,
    ignoring any warnings that match the list (see match::simple), and returns
    the result of the coderef.

    This differs from the standard `no warnings` pragma in that it acts
    dynamically instead of lexically, allowing you to suppress the printing of
    warnings which come from third-party modules, etc. Internally, it uses
    $SIG{__WARN__} but if you already have a handler for `__WARN__`, this
    module should be smart enough to work alongside it unless you're doing
    something especially odd.
