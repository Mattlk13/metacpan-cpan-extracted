NAME
    new - Object instantiation sugar for one-liners

SYNOPSIS
    Simplest possible usage:

      perl -Mnew=HTTP::Tiny -E \
        'say $O->get("http://trout.me.uk/X11/vimrc")->{content}'

    With arguments:

      perl -Mnew=HTTP::Tiny,max_redirects,3 -E \
        'say $O->get("http://trout.me.uk/X11/vimrc")->{content}'

    With custom object name:

      perl -Mnew=HTTP::Tiny,\$H -E \
        'say $H->get("http://trout.me.uk/X11/vimrc")->{content}'

    With both:

      perl -Mnew=HTTP::Tiny,\$H,max_redirects,3 -E \
        'say $H->get("http://trout.me.uk/X11/vimrc")->{content}'

DESCRIPTION
  import
      new->import($class, @args)

    First we "require" the file for $class, then call

      $class->new(@args)

    then install the resulting object in $O in the calling package.

    Caveat: if $class loads successfully but does not have a "new" method,
    we install the $class instead since you might want to call class
    methods.

    If the first argument to "import" after $class begins with "$", this is
    treated as the name to install the object as, so

      new->import($class, '$Obj', @args);

    will create a variable $Obj in the calling package instead of $O.
