pluskeys

This pragma provides a declarative way to have compile-time 
typo safety on hash keys, usually for objects.

After use pluskey qw(INITIALIZED), then $self->{ +INITIALIZED } is 
fine but $self->{ +INITILIZED } is a compile-time error.

Multiple inheritance even using duplicate keynames is supported
because the pluskeys are actually constant functions that return
package-qualified strings.

See the included documentation for details.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
standard Unix man command:

    man pluskeys

If that fails, your MANPATH is probably set up wrong and you
will probably be forced to use the awful perldoc program instead.
