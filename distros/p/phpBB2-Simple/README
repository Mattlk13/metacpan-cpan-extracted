NAME

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of phpBB2::Simple (from Perl
    distribution phpBB2-Simple), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    I know, phpBB2 is beyond ancient (2007 and earlier), but our intranet
    board still runs it and some things are more convenient to do via CLI
    script than via web-based administration panel.
