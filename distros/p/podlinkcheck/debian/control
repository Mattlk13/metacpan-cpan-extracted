Description: Check L<> links in Perl POD
 Link target module name and sections are checked.  Target section
 checking parses the POD in the target module or document.  Module
 existence is checked from the CPAN, CPAN::SQLite, CPANPLUS or
 cpanminus indexes too.  Man page links are checked by running the man
 program.
