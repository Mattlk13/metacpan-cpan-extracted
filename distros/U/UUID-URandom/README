NAME
    UUID::URandom - UUIDs based on /dev/urandom or the Windows Crypto API

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use UUID::URandom qw/create_uuid/;

        my $uuid = create_uuid();

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a portable, secure generator of RFC-4122
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122> version 4 (random) UUIDs. It is a
    thin wrapper around Crypt::URandom to set the UUID version and variant
    bits required by the RFC.

USAGE
    No functions are exported by default.

FUNCTIONS
  create_uuid
        my $uuid = create_uuid();

        # "\x95\x5a\xe4\x96\x8b\xb2\x45\x0b\x9c\x7e\x99\xf5\x01\xdf\x90\xfe"

    This returns a new UUID as a 16 byte 'binary' string.

  create_uuid_hex
        my $uuid = create_uuid_hex();

        # "955ae4968bb2450b9c7e99f501df90fe"

    This returns a new UUID as a 32-byte hexadecimal string.

  create_uuid_string
        my $uuid = create_uuid_string();

        # "955ae496-8bb2-450b-9c7e-99f501df90fe"

    This returns a new UUID in the 36-byte RFC-4122 canonical string
    representation. (N.B. The canonical representation is lower-case.)

FORK AND THREAD SAFETY
    The underlying Crypt::URandom is believed to be fork and thread safe.

SEE ALSO
    There are a number of other modules that provide version 4 UUIDs. Many
    rely on insecure or non-crypto-strength random number generators.
