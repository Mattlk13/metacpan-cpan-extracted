This archive contains the distribution Util-H2O-More,
version 0.0.9:

  like if C<bless> created accessors for you. Intended for hash reference-based Perl OOP only. This module uses C<Util::H2O::h2o> as the basis for actual object creation; but there's no reason other accessor makers couldn't have been used or can be used. I just really like C<h2o>. :-)
