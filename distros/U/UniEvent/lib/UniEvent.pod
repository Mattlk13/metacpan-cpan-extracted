=head1 DESCRIPTION

UniEvent is an extendable object-oriented event loop framework. It's also an abstraction layer on top of event loop which
provides engine-independent API (like L<AnyEvent>). It's written fully in C++ and is very fast.

The main feature is that it supports implementing third-party plugins (protocol adapters) in C++/XS 
(see L<XS::Manifesto>)  and therefore without any perfomance penalties. UniEvent support multiple backends 
(libuv is the only implemented at the moment).
