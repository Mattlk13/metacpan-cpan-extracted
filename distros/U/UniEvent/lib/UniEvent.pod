=head1 DESCRIPTION

UniEvent is an extendable object-oriented event loop framework. It's also an abstraction layer on top of event loop which
provides engine-independent API (like L<Any::Event>). It's written fully in C++ and is very fast.

The main feature is that it supports implementing third-party plugins (protocol adapters) in C++ (XS) and therefore without any
perfomance penalties. UniEvent support multiple backends (libuv is the only implemented at the moment).
