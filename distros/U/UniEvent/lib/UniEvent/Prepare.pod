=head1 NAME

UniEvent::Prepare - runs the given callback once before polling for I/O

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $loop = UniEvent::Loop->new;
    my $h = UniEvent::Prepare->new($loop);
    $h->event->add(sub { say 'hello' });
    $h->start;
    $loop->run_nowait;  # prints 'hello'
    $loop->run_nowait;  # prints 'hello' again

    $h->stop;
    $loop->run_nowait;  # no effect

    $h->reset;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Prepare handle is useful for doing some actions (in the form of callbacks
or listener) before polling I/O. It is inherited from L<UniEvent::Handle>.

If you need to do some actions B<after> polling I/O, consider using
L<UniEvent::Check>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new([$loop = UniEvent::Loop->default_loop])

Constructs new Prepare handle and binds it to the specified event loop

=head2 start([$callback = undef])

Starts the prepare handle, i.e. makes it active for the next even loop
iteration. Optionally it adds the C<$callback> to the event listeners.

=head2 stop()

Stops the prepare handle, i.e. makes it inactive for the next event loop
iteration.

=head2 callback($code)

Sets the callback, which will be invoked before loop run. All previously
set event listeners or callbacks are discarded.

=head2 event()

Returns L<XS::Framework::CallbackDispatcher> instance, where callback(s)
can be assigned with. The callbacks will be invoked before loop run.

The C++ interface is:

    void(const PrepareSP&);

On perl side it the callbacks will be called :

    $callback->($handle);

Multiple callbacks can be added via the L<XS::Framework::CallbackDispatcher>
interface.

=head2 event_listener($delegate [, $weak = false])


Creates and returns wrapper around the C<$delegate> object of arbitrary
class, having the following methods:

  $delegate->on_prepare($handle);

The delegated object can be seen as alternative of setting indivitual callbacks
or as a way of groupping them. The C<$delegate> object can optionally be weakened.

=head2 call_now()

Immediately ivokes assigned callbacks and listeners in the caller context
(i.e. not waiting loop run).
