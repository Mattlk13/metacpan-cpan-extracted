=head1 NAME

UniEvent::Request::Shutdown - stream write request

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The entire purpose of the class is to allow track write requests.
It can be used to identify, which pieces of data has been written, e.g.:

    my %tracked;
    $stream->write_callback(sub {
        my ($stream, $error_code, $request) = @_;
        ... if $error_code;
        say @{ $tracked{$request} }, " has been written to network";
    });
    ...;
    my $piece1 = \"piece1";
    my $piece2 = \"piece2";

    my $r1 = $stream->write($$piece1);
    $tracked{$r1} = $piece1;

    my $r2 = $stream->write($$piece2);
    $tracked{$r2} = $piece2;

As the alternative, the one-shot callback can be used with C<write>
method, howerver it might be less convenient:

    $stream->write('piece1', sub {
       my ($stream, $error_code) = @_;
       ... if $error_code;
    });

    $stream->write('piece2', sub {
       my ($stream, $error_code) = @_;
       ... if $error_code;
    });
