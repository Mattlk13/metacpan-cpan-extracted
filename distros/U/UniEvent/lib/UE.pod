=head1 NAME

UE - aliased namespace for UniEvent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is just a shortcut for L<UniEvent>. E.g. instead of

    my $loop = UniEvent::Loop->new;

it can be written as

    my $loop = UE::Loop->new;

However keep in mind, that created objects are always of C<UniEvent::XXXX> class. It matters in these kind of checks:

    if (ref($t) eq 'UniEvent::Timer') # ok
    if (ref($t) eq 'UE::Timer')       # WRONG!
