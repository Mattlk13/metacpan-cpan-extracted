This is the README for Unicode::Diacritic::Strip version 0.14.

Unicode::Diacritic::Strip is a "module" for the Perl computer programming
language, a library of computer code to install on a computer.  This
document contains four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Unicode::Diacritic::Strip - strip diacritics from Unicode text

This module offers two ways to remove diacritics from Unicode
text. One of them, "strip_diacritics", uses the Unicode
decompositions to break the characters down. The other one,
"fast_strip", is a faster alternative based on a hash of
alphabetical characters with and without diacritics. There is also
"strip_alphabet", which is the same as "strip_diacritics", but it
also returns a list of what characters were changed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
website:

    * http://metacpan.org/release/Unicode-Diacritic-Strip

(This link goes to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Unicode::Diacritic::Strip

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.8.9 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Unicode::Diacritic::Strip

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Unicode::Diacritic::Strip

To install the module from the source file,
Unicode-Diacritic-Strip-0.14.tar.gz, follow this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Unicode-Diacritic-Strip-0.14.tar.gz
    cd Unicode-Diacritic-Strip-0.14
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
