NAME
    UUID::Tiny::Patch::UseMRS - Make UUID::Tiny use Math::Random::Secure's
    rand()

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of UUID::Tiny::Patch::UseMRS (from
    Perl distribution UUID-Tiny-Patch-UseMRS), released on 2020-12-22.

SYNOPSIS
     use UUID::Tiny::Patch::UseMRS;
     say UUID::Tiny::create_uuid();

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes UUID::Tiny use "rand()" from Math::Random::Secure
    instead of the default "rand()" that comes with Perl. It is useful for
    creating cryptographically secure UUID's. On the other hand, as a note,
    this makes generate() around 3 times slower on my Dell XPS 13 laptop.

    After you "use" this module, use UUID::Tiny as usual.
