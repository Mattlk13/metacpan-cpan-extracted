VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of UUID::Random::Secure (from Perl

    Use like you would UUID::Random:

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  generate
    Generate a single v4 UUID string in the formatted 32 hexadecimal digits:

    Note that this module does not produce RFC 4122-compliant v4 (random)
    UUIDs (no encoding of variant and version information into the UUID).
    See "generate_rfc" for UUIDs that comply to RFC 4122.

  generate_rfc
    Generate RFC-compliant a single v4 UUID string in the form of:

     xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

    where "x" is any hexadecimal digits ([0-9a-f]), "M" is 4, and N is
    either 8, 9, "a", or "b" (1000, 1001, 1010, or 1011 in binary).
