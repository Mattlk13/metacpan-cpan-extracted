Revision history for Perl extension UV

1.907 2021-04-09
    - Various small fixes from @Corion to improve unit testing on MSWin32

1.906 2021-03-25
    - Don't worry about `AI_V4MAPPED` on systems which don't provide it
    - Removed now-dead `cpanfile`

1.905 TRIAL 2021-03-23
    - Various blind stabbings-in-the-dark that might be MSWin32 bugfixes
       + Export SIG* constants because libuv emulates a few
       + Handle CRLF linefeeds in Process tests
       + Maybe we need to _MAKE_SOCK() when calling uv_tcp_open() and
         uv_udp_open()
       + Skip some AF_UNIX tests that won't work there
    - Return hrtime() as an NV on platforms without 64bit int (thanks ilmari)

1.904 TRIAL 2021-03-19
    - Use cmp_ok() on unreliably-failing timer test so when it fails we at
      least get a log of the numbers
    - No need for _cleanup_loop() in unit tests
    - Remove UV::Loop->walk and related code because it isn't implemented
      and can't easily be made to work

1.903 TRIAL 2021-01-19
    - Switch build system to Module::Build::Using::PkgConfig to see if the
      late-alien handling there works better for users to install

1.902     2021-01-19
    - Adjust Makefile.PL for better pkg-config or Alien handling

1.900, 1.901
    - Totally rewritten XS logic by Paul "LeoNerd" Evans

1.000006  2018-04-16 (TRIAL)
    - Removed is_closing()
    - Removed is_active()
    - Removed loop_configure()
    - Removed loop_alive()
    - Removed reference to UV::Poll->new_socket() as that's all done in the
      standard ->new() constructor now.
    - Updated documentation for the Handle classes to better indicate their
      use.
    - Removed extra library detection for windows as this is now done in
      Alien::libuv
    - Bumped the requirement of Alien::libuv to 1.000
    - Removed some bad Poll tests
    - Add try/catch block for all Handle start methods
    - Removed Moo requirements

1.000005  2018-01-28 (TRIAL)
    - Update 02-loop-alive.t to more closely resemble libuv's
    - Remove lib/p5uv_handles.h (no longer needed)
    - Remove lib/p5uv_loops.h (no longer needed)
    - Ensure all Handle objects call ->_destruct() on destruction rather than
      just calling close.
    - Provide the current "closed" state of the handle to its destructor to
      assist with knowing when to free safely.
    - Rename Loop->_destroy() to Loop->_destruct() to be consistent
    - Make Loop->_destroy() use p5uv_destroy_loop() to free properly
    - A few changes at the suggestion of Devel::PPPort
    - Added a few more tests to ensure we can export things correctly
    - Added a UV::check() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Check->new
    - Added a UV::idle() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Idle->new
    - Added a UV::poll() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Poll->new
    - Added a UV::prepare() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Prepare->new
    - Reworked the tests to exercise the above convenience wrappers
    - Removed a few superfluous 'use' statements

1.000004  2018-01-25 (TRIAL)
    - Require at least ExtUtils::MakeMaker v7.12 for XSMULTI
    - Move all *.[ch] into lib with the module using XSMULTI (mohawk)
    - Redesign everything
    - Now using XS::Object::Magic to hide the C structs within our Perl objects
    - Now using Moo
    - Doing more of the work in Perl-land
    - Pretty much a complete-rewrite from v1.000003

1.000003  2017-10-26 (TRIAL)
    - Don't store Loop stashes globally (thread safety)
    - Moved constant declarations / some de-dupe efforts (Thanks Paul Evans)
    - Added Perl context to all functions that call the Perl API
    - Separated loop and handle functions from the XS interface

1.000002  2017-09-24 (TRIAL)
    - Don't store Handle stashes globally for Handle types (thread safety)
    - Simplified the typemap
    - Removed UV::default_loop from UV.xs and added to UV.pm instead
    - Renamed some macros to make more sense.
    - Removed unused macros
    - Default value for SIGPROF as it doesn't exist in Windows (useful in *nix)

1.000001  2017-08-17 (TRIAL)
    - Update some prereqs
    - Remove use of SO_REUSEPORT in the tests. We store the port already.
