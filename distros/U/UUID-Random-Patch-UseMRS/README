NAME
    UUID::Random::Patch::UseMRS - Make UUID::Random use
    Math::Random::Secure's rand()

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of UUID::Random::Patch::UseMRS
    (from Perl distribution UUID-Random-Patch-UseMRS), released on
    2021-01-24.

SYNOPSIS
     use UUID::Random::Patch::UseMRS;
     say UUID::Random::generate();

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes UUID::Random use "rand()" from Math::Random::Secure
    instead of the default "rand()" that comes with Perl. It is useful for
    creating cryptographically secure UUID's. On the other hand, as a note,
    this makes generate() around 20 times slower on my PC.

    After you "use" this module, use UUID::Random as usual.
