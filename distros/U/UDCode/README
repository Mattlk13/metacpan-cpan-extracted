UDCode

A *code* is a set of strings, called the *code words*. A code is
*uniquely decodable* if any string *S* that is a concatenation of code
words is so in *exactly one way*.

For example, the code "('ab', 'abba', 'b')" is *not* uniquely decodable,
because 'abba' . 'b' eq 'ab' . 'b' . 'ab'. But the code "('a', 'ab',
'abb')" *is* uniquely decodable, because there is no such pair of
sequences of code words.

This module provides a pair of functions to tell whether a set of code
words is a uniquely decodable code, and to find an example of sequences
of code words whose concatenations are the same, if there is such a
pair.
