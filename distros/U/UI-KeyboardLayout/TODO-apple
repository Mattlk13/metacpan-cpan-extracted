• Create actions basing on arrays, not hashes;
• Alt-→ etc;
• Keypad???
• Math alphabets???
• Access via Control-Keys.
• Shortcuts to satellites of companion faces (without Mnu-).
• Good terminators for imported prefixes.
• Conditional doHEX
• action⸣s should be CapsLock-dependent if on alphanum, but contain deadkeys (like 'u'/'U' for HEX-unicode)
• Compose + OR Compose SPACE: enable HEX
• Make the offset 4100 customizable, or auto-calculated.
