Thank you for your interest in contributing to my project! I only have
a few suggestions:

- I’d rather see [pull requests] instead of patches.
  Please make sure to create branches for each change.
- Also, please add a new entry for each change in the `Changes` file.
- If it’s a major change, please [send me an email] first so we can chat
  about it and I can tag it as being worked on.
  
Thanks again!
