Text-ReadConditionally

This is a pre-processor that lives in your Perl program's input stream.
Your program does not need code to conditionally discard some input, include
files and substitute values.

An easy way of reading input where some lines are read conditionally and other
files included: .if/.else/.elseif/.fi, do: .include .let .print, loops: .while
.for; subroutine definition & call - and more.

Few changes are needed to your program, just open a file with this
module and use C<< <$fh> >> and C<< $fh->getline >>, etc.

    use Text::ReadConditionally;

    my $fh = new Text::ReadConditionally(File => './input.file') or
        die "Startup error: $Text::ReadConditionally::errstr\n";

    $fh->{Math}->VarSetScalar('items', 20); # var used in input stream

    while(<$fh>) {
        print $_;    # Or other processing of input
    }

    die($Text::ReadConditionally::errstr . "\n")
        if($fn->error);

    # Use pre-processor variable
    print "Sum output " . $fh->{Math}->ParseToScalar('sum') . "\n";

The input file contains text with lines of control directives, eg:

    A line of text
    .let sum = sum - 2
    .if sum < 20
    .echo Only \v{sum} items
    .elsif sum > 40
    There is plenty of stock
    .fi
    .# This is a comment
    .for i := 0 ;; i < items ;; i++
    .echo Item \v{i} is \v{stock[i]}
    .done
    .include $IncPath/report-footer.inc

Within input you may:

* evaluate expressions, assign variables

* conditions: .if/.unless/.elseif

* loops: while/until/for

* include other files and from pipes

* define subroutines that may take arguments and return a value that
  can be used in if/loop conditions

* log to stdout and stderr

* read lines to pre-processor variables

The advantage over a separate pre-processor is that the application can share
state (variables) with the pre-processor.

The lead in character (C<.>) can be changed.
