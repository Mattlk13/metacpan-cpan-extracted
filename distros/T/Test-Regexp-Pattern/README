NAME
    Test::Regexp::Pattern - Test Regexp::Pattern patterns

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.010 of Test::Regexp::Pattern (from
    Perl distribution Test-Regexp-Pattern), released on 2022-07-24.

SYNOPSIS
    To check all regexp patterns in a module:

     use Test::Regexp::Pattern;
     regexp_patterns_in_module_ok("Foo::Bar", {opt => ...}, $msg);

    Alternatively, you can check all regexp patterns in all modules in a
    distro:

     # save in release-regexp-pattern.t, put in distro's t/ subdirectory
     use Test::More;
     plan skip_all => "Not release testing" unless $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING};
     eval "use Test::Regexp::Pattern";
     plan skip_all => "Test::Regexp::Pattern required for testing Regexp::Pattern patterns" if $@;
     regexp_patterns_in_all_modules_ok({opt => ...}, $msg);

DESCRIPTION
    This module performs various checks on a module's Regexp::Pattern
    patterns. It is recommended that you include something like the above
    "release-regexp-pattern.t" in your distribution if you add regexp
    patterns to your code. If you use Dist::Zilla to build your
    distribution, there is a [Regexp::Pattern] plugin which automatically
    adds this release test file during build.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Some code taken from Test::Pod::Coverage by Andy Lester.

FUNCTIONS
    All these functions are exported by default.

  regexp_patterns_in_module_ok($module [, \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Load $module and perform test for regexp patterns (%RE) in the module.

    Available options:

    *   test_examples => bool (default: 1)

  regexp_patterns_in_all_modules_ok([ \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Look for modules in directory "lib" (or "blib" instead, if it exists),
    and run "regexp_patterns_in_module_ok()" against each of them.

    Options are the same as in "regexp_patterns_in_module_ok()".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
