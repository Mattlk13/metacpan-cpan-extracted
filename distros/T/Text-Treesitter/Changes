Revision history for Text-Treesitter

0.03    2023-01-05
        [CHANGES]
         * Provide a real toplevel `Text::Treesitter` class to wrap the
           lower-level parts in a more convenient wrapper API
         * Compile .o files using `-fPIC` because some scanner C++ files will
           need it
         * Added `examples/viewtree.pl` as a tree/grammar debugging tool
         * Lazily load `ExtUtils::CppGuess` as needed because most of the time
           it isn't.

0.02    2023-01-04
        [CHANGES]
         * Added Text::Treesitter::Query, ::QueryCursor and ::QueryMatch
         * Rewrote highlight.pl example script to use the query system to
           extract highlights from the language queries/highlights.scm file
