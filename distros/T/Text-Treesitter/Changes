Revision history for Text-Treesitter

0.06    2023-01-19
        [CHANGES]
         * Handle query predicates
         * Recognise several common ones - `eq?`, `match?`, `contains?`,
           `any-of?` and the `not-` prefixed inverted versions of them
         * Further improvements to highlight.pl:
            + skip matches on failed predicate tests
            + define more highlight groups as used by tree-sitter-{perl,pod}

0.05    2023-01-17
        [CHANGES]
         * Added char-counting node start / end accessors
         * Nicer error message on ts_query_new() failure
         * Better config file search to closer match `tree-sitter-cli`
         * Print field names in viewtree.pl for better grammar debugging

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Correctly implement Node->parent method
         * Handle UTF-8 source and query strings correctly; count offsets in
           chars not bytes

0.04    2023-01-12
        [CHANGES]
         * Remember the original source text in a Tree instance
         * Remember the Tree instance that generated every Node
         * Added `->text` accessor on both Tree and Node instances
         * Read the user's `tree-sitter/config.json` if found
         * Use the configured `parser-directories` to find lang_dir if not
           supplied

0.03    2023-01-05
        [CHANGES]
         * Provide a real toplevel `Text::Treesitter` class to wrap the
           lower-level parts in a more convenient wrapper API
         * Compile .o files using `-fPIC` because some scanner C++ files will
           need it
         * Added `examples/viewtree.pl` as a tree/grammar debugging tool
         * Lazily load `ExtUtils::CppGuess` as needed because most of the time
           it isn't.

0.02    2023-01-04
        [CHANGES]
         * Added Text::Treesitter::Query, ::QueryCursor and ::QueryMatch
         * Rewrote highlight.pl example script to use the query system to
           extract highlights from the language queries/highlights.scm file

0.01    2023-01-04
