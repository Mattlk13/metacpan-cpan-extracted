NAME
    Type::FromSah - create an efficient Type::Tiny type constraint from a
    Data::Sah schema

SYNOPSIS
      package My::Types {
        use Type::Library -base;
        use Type::FromSah qw( sah2type );
    
        __PACKAGE__->add_type(
          sah2type( [ "int", min => 1, max => 10 ], name => 'SmallInt' )
        );
      }
  
      use MyTypes qw(SmallInt);
  
      SmallInt->assert_valid( 7 );

DESCRIPTION
  Functions
    This module exports one function.

   `sah2type( $schema, %options )`
    Takes a Data::Sah schema (which should be an arrayref), and generates a
    Type::Tiny type constraint object for it. Additional key-value pairs will
    be passed to the Type::Tiny constructor.
