NAME
    Text::Wrap::NoStrip - Line wrapping without stripping the whitespace

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Text::Wrap::NoStrip (from Perl
    distribution Text-Wrap-NoStrip), released on 2023-02-18.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use Text::Wrap (but currently only $columns variable
    is supported):

     use Text::Wrap::NoStrip qw(wrap);
     $Text::Wrap::NoStrip::columns = 80; # default 76
     print wrap('', '  ', @text);

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: Early implementaiton, no tab handling.

    This module provides "wrap()" variant that does not strip the
    whitespaces, to make unfolding easier and capable of returning the
    original text. Contrast:

     # original $text
     longwordlongwordlongword word   word   word word

     # wrapped by Text::Wrap::wrap('', 'x', $text), with added quotes
     # 123456789012
     "longwordlongw"
     "xordlongword"
     "xword   word"
     "xword word"

     # wrapped by Text::Wrapp::NoStrip::wrap('', ' ', $text)
     "longwordlongw"
     "xordlongword"
     "x word   word"
     "x   word word"

    To get back the original $text, you can do:

     ($text = $wrapped) =~ s/\nx//g;

FUNCTIONS
  wrap
    Usage:

     wrap($initial_indent, $subsequent_indent, @text); # => str

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
