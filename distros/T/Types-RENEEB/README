DESCRIPTION

    Types::RENEEB is a collection of types I need very often

MODULES

    These Types:: modules are shipped in this distribution:

      * Types::Dist

      * Types::OTRS

    Types::RENEEB inherits the types of the mentioned modules.

 Types::Dist

  DistFQ

    DistName-DistVersion

        package MyClass;
    
        use Moo;
        use Types::Dist qw(DistName);
    
        has dist => ( is => 'ro', isa => DistName );
    
        1;

    And then use your class:

        my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => 'Types-RENEEB-0.09' );
        my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => '0.09' );         # fails
        my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => 'Types-RENEEB' ); # fails

  DistName

    A name of a distribution

        my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => 'Types-RENEEB' ); # ok

  DistVersion

    A version of a distribution

        my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => '0.09' ); # ok

  CPANfile

    An instance of Module::CPANfile

        package MyClass;
    
        use Moo;
        use Types::Dist qw(CPANfile);
    
        has prereqs => ( is => 'ro', isa => CPANfile, coerce => 1 );
    
        1;

    And then use your class:

        my $object   = MyClass->new( prereqs => '/path/to/cpanfile' );
        my @features = $object->prereqs->features; # call features method from Module::CPANfile

 Types::OTRS

  OTRSVersion

    An OTRS version looks like 2.4.5 or 6.0.1.

  OTRSVersionWildcard

    An OTRS version with wildcard as used in Addons. To define a version of
    the OTRS framework that is needed to install the addon, the developer
    can use 'x' as a wildcard.

    E.g. Addons for OTRS 6.x can be installed on any OTRS 6 installation,
    whilst addons that define 2.4.x as the framework version can only
    installed on any OTRS 2.4 installation, but not on OTRS 2.3
    installation.

  OPMFile

    An object of OTRS::OPM::Parser.

    It checks if the file exists and can be parsed without an error.

  COERCIONS

   OPMFile

      * From String to OTRS::OPM::Parser

      When a string is given, it is coerced into an OTRS::OPM::Parser
      object.
