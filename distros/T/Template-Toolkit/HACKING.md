# Hacker's Guide

Please hack on the Template Toolkit.  It has been designed to be
extensible and has literally dozens of programmer hooks that you can
tap into to do all sorts of cool things.  The object oriented
architecture allows you to create your own subclassed modules to
implement your own services, providers, filters, plugins, and so on.

The Template::Manual::Internals document gives a brief overview of the
architecture.  Unfortunately, it's not as complete as it could be,
but the code is well documented and generally easy to follow.  Don't
be afraid to use the source, Luke.

The internals document also contains information about preparing and
applying patches, updating the documentation and various other
useful tips.
