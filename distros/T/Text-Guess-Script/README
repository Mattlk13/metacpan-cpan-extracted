SYNOPSIS

      use Text::Guess::Script;
      print Text::Guess::Script->guess('Hello World'); # prints Latn
    
      print Text::Guess::Script->guesses('Hello World')->[0]->[0]; # Latn
      print Text::Guess::Script->guesses('Hello World')->[0]->[2]; # Latin
    
      print Text::Guess::Script->guesses('Hello World')->[1]->[0]; # Zyyy
      print Text::Guess::Script->guesses('Hello World')->[1]->[2]; # Common
    
      use Data::Dumper;
      print Dumper(Text::Guess::Script->guesses('Hello World'));
      $VAR1 = [
              [
                'Latn',
                '0.909090909090909',
                'Latin'
              ],
              [
                'Zyyy',
                '0.0909090909090909',
                'Common'
              ]
            ];

DESCRIPTION

    Text::Guess::Script gets the script property for each character in the
    text and returns the code of the script with the most characters.

 CONSTRUCTOR

    new()

      Creates a new object which maintains internal storage areas for the
      Text::Guess::Script computation. Use one of these per concurrent
      Text::Guess::Script->guess() call.

 METHODS

    guess($text)

      Returns the script code with the most characters.

    guesses($text)

      Returns an array reference with an array, sorted descending by
      relative frequency for each script. Each entry is a triple of script
      code, relative frequency and script name:

        $guesses = [
          [ 'Latn', '0.909090909090909',  'Latin'  ],
          [ 'Zyyy', '0.0909090909090909', 'Common' ],
        ];

 EXPORT

    None by design.

STABILITY

    Until release of version 1.00 the included methods, names of methods
    and their interfaces are subject to change.

    Beginning with version 1.00 the specification will be stable, i.e. not
    changed between major versions.
