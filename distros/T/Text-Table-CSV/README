NAME
    Text::Table::CSV - Generate CSV

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.020 of Text::Table::CSV (from Perl
    distribution Text-Table-CSV), released on 2018-06-30.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::CSV;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123456'],
         ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],
         ['carol', 'brig gen', '8745'],
     ];
     print Text::Table::CSV::table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as CSV. This is basically a way to
    generate CSV using the same interface as that of Text::Table::Tiny
    (v0.03) or Text::Table::Org.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

     "Name","Rank","Serial"
     "alice","pvt","123456"
     "bob","cpl","98765321"
     "carol","brig gen","8745"

FUNCTIONS
  table(%params) => str
  OPTIONS
    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows (aoaos)

        Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
        data, where each row is an array reference.
