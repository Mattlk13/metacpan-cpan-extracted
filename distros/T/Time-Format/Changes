1.15  2019 July 26
        - Fix a bug in the test suite due to floating-point rounding.  Thanks to
          Slaven Rezic (see CPAN RT bug 130150:
                              https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130150)
        - Also improved __DATA__ handling, so as not to hold a lock on the library.

1.14  2019 July 22
        - Fix CPAN RT bug 87484 (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=87484),
          concerning very small floating-point values (e.g. "2.1458e-06").
        - Fix CPAN RT Bug 95447, concerning floating-point numerical time values.
        - Fix CPAN RT Bug 121367, concerning loading perl-only routines after forking.
          This might (?) also fix bug 74880, but I can't reproduce that.
        - Skip locale tests on openbsd platform.
        - Fix accented strings in locale.t

1.13  2019 July 18
        - Fix CPAN RT bug 85001.
          This was a problem in the test suite only; no code changes were made
          in the main module lib/Time/Format.pm.
          The problem existed in how the test suite checked for whether certain
          CPAN modules were installed, and especially in how it attempted to
          unload them from memory afterward.
          Thanks to Sendu Bala for reporting this -- and to Jim Keenan for
          pushing me to fix this.


1.12  2012 September 27
        - Fix CPAN RT bug 44167/54990: Negative milliseconds/microseconds.
          This was a boneheaded mistake I should have fixed years ago.
          Many thanks to Karl Moens for reporting the error, and for a patch.

        - Fix CPAN RT bug 47229: Build.PL dependencies.
          Unfortunately, I cannot fix Makefile.PL, since ExtUtils::MakeMaker
          has no concept of "recommended" or "optional" modules.
          Thanks to Jens Rehsack for the suggestion.

        - Fix CPAN RT bug 55630: ISO-8601 Z (Zulu, UTC) marker not supported.
          Thanks to Will Coleda for pointing this out.

        - Fix CPAN RT bug 76705/76707 (maybe): month out of range.
          I can't reproduce this bug, but I made a change to the time parsing
          that might fix it.  Thanks to Todd Bezenek for reporting the problem.


1.11  2009 June 18
        - Fix error in the new test (past.t) for v1.10!
        - Rearrange eval's throughout test code to rely on $@ less.


1.10  2009 June 17
        - Bug fix: Did not trim leading zero off the am/pm hour (H
          code) if the argument was a DateTime.  Thanks to Coke Coleda
          for spotting this.


1.09  2008 May 27
        - Bug fix: generated error if second argument to time_format
          was a string and was in December.  Thanks to Bokor BÃ©la for
          spotting this one.


1.08  2008 May 27
        - Reset $@ at certain places, so as to work with older
          (broken) perls.  Again, thanks to Slaven Rezic.


1.07  2008 March 31
        - More test-case changes, to work with older perls.  Many
          thanks to Slaven Rezic and the rest of the tireless CPAN
          testers!


1.06  2008 March 28
        - Fix a broken test case in time.t; failed for non-English
          locales.


1.05  2008 March 27
        - Fix a typo bug in Makefile.PL


1.04  2008 March 26
        - Worked around a POSIX bug which would cause hangs under
          cygwin.
        - Fixed a couple test cases.


1.03  2008 March 24
        - Fixed a broken test case.
        - Added Module::Build support.


1.02  2005 December 1
        - No changes. Had to increment the number because of a PAUSE
          upload problem.


1.01  2005 December 1
        - Support for DateTime, Date::Manip, and ISO 8601 strings.


1.00  2004 September 24
	- Increase version to 1.00.
	- More flexible version-compatibility checking with
	  Time::Format_XS
        - Fix some warning messages (and some typos) in tests.


0.13  2003 August 1
        - Check that the version of Time::Format_XS matches our version.
        - Test suite now tests perl-only routines separately from
          XS-enabled routines.
        - Further delay compilation of time_format until needed.


0.12  2003 July 20
        - Add \Q, \U, \L, \u, \l, \E handling in format strings.
        - Change "Month" (etc) to be defined as "locale-preferred
          capitalization" rather than "always ucfirst".  Thanks to
          Mark Jason Dominus for his thoughts on this topic.
        - Don't bother compiling the Perl routines until we know that
          the XS routines (in Time::Format_XS) are not available.


0.11  2003 July 7
        - Some changes for ActiveState Perl.  Thanks again to Will Coleda.


0.10  2003 July 5
        - Some speed improvements.  Removed need for Exporter, Carp.
        - Add support for optional Time::Format_XS module.
        - More test suite changes, due to strftime not being nearly as
          standard as you'd think it would be.
        - Removed support for deprecated month/minute codes.


0.09  2003 June 23
        - Add more checking on the Date::Manip module, which dies messily
          if it gets upset about not finding things like Time Zone.  This
          affects the test suite only -- No changes to Time::Format.


0.08  2003 June 22
        - Distribute correct SIGNATURE file; a bad one was distributed
          with v0.07.  (Thanks to Jeroen Latour again).


0.07  2003 June 21
        - Fix some bugs in the test suite -- NO changes to Format.pm
          (Thanks to CPAN tester Jeroen Latour!)


0.06  2003 June 20
        - Fix handling of "yyyy/mon".
        - Minor documentation fixes (Thanks to Will Coleda!).
        - Add th/TH formatting codes.
        - Allow backslash escaping in format strings.


0.05  2003 June 17
        - Add "tz" timezone format code to %time.
        - Change unambiguous month/minute format codes.
        - Some minor speed improvements.


0.04  2003 June 13
        - Add internationalization support (Month/weekday names).
        - Expose underlying function interface to all hashes.
        - Export %time and time_format by default.


0.03  2003 June 11
        - Fix the tests to work in other time zones than my own!


0.02  2003 June 10
        - Change the %time formatting codes.
        - Speed up the code somewhat.
        - Add many tests
