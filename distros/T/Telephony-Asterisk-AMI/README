Telephony-Asterisk-AMI version 0.006, released December 26, 2015


This module is a simple client for the Asterisk Manager Interface.
It's better documented and less buggy than Asterisk::Manager, and
has fewer prerequisites than Asterisk::AMI.

If you need a more sophisticated client (especially for use in an
event-driven program), try Asterisk::AMI.
