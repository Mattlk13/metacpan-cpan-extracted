NAME
    Test::Rinci::CmdLine - Test Rinci metadata of Perinci::CmdLine scripts

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Test::Rinci::CmdLine (from Perl
    distribution Test-Rinci-CmdLine), released on 2018-11-22.

SYNOPSIS
    To check all metadata in a script:

     use Test::Rinci::CmdLine tests => 1;
     metadata_in_script_ok("script.pl", {opt => ...}, $msg);

    Alternatively, you can check all metadata in all scripts in a distro:

     # save in release-rinci-cmdline.t, put in distro's t/ subdirectory
     use Test::More;
     plan skip_all => "Not release testing" unless $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING};
     eval "use Test::Rinci::CmdLine";
     plan skip_all => "Test::Rinci::CmdLine required for testing Rinci metadata" if $@;
     metadata_in_all_scripts_ok({opt => ...}, $msg);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is like Test::Rinci except that it looks for metadata in the
    "main" package of scripts, instead of modules.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Some code taken from Test::Pod::Coverage by Andy Lester.

FUNCTIONS
    All these functions are exported by default.

  metadata_in_script_ok($module [, \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Load $script, get its metadata in the "main" package, and perform test
    on the metadata on the "main" package using Test::Rinci's
    "metadata_in_module_ok()". See Test::Rinci for available options.

  metadata_in_scripts_ok([ \%opts, ] \@scripts [, $msg])
    Run "metadata_in_script_ok()" for each script specified in @scripts.

    Options are the same as in "metadata_in_script_ok()".

  metadata_in_all_scripts_ok([ \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Look for scripts in directory "script" (and "scripts" and "bin") and run
    "metadata_in_script_ok()" on each of them.

    Options are the same as in "metadata_in_script_ok()".
