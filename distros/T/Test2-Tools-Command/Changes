Revision history for Test2-Tools-Command

0.20    2023-01-02
        Add is_exit() so that Test::UnixExit can be replaced by
        this module. And, prevent installation on Windows due to
        test failures.

0.11    2023-01-01
        Make better use of Test2. Fix tests such that stdout and
        stderr tests are actually called, maybe. Remove needless
        dependency on Cwd.

0.10    2022-12-31
        Breaking interface changes and other such work.
        * Change the return values of command().
        * qr// or exact string tests on stdout, stderr.
        * Add munge_signal for when the signal type varies.
        * Remove want_fh as that interacts poorly with timeout. 
        * Improved test names for when tests fail, or the ability to
          specify a custom name associated with the tests.
