Revision history for Text-NumericData

2.003002
	- Re-release with correct metadata (build system misuse).

2.003001
	- Actually install txdodeint script from Makefile.PL.

2.003000
	- New tool: txdodeint for numerical integration.
	- Fix txdcalc help mentioning --line instead of the correct --lin.
	- Enhancements on txdrows, adding --ranges and more robust handling
	  of expressions (adding parentheses around the user-provided code). Of
	  course this is only for avoiding accidents. Intentionally malicious code
	  will always do malicious things (use of Safe compartments will be
	  considered in the future).
	- The script txdcontract can now do binning according coordinate values,
	  not just line numbers.

2.002000
	- Officially added txdhistogram tool.
	- Re-release after realising that the MANIFEST was missing the added tool
	  and installation failed. Forget 2.001001. Please.

2.001001
	- Use deep copies of defaults to avoid multiple instances of
	  Text::NumericData::App in one process messing with each other via
	  possibly unsafe use of Config::Param.
	- Text::NumericData::File avoids tainted column indices in sort code.
	- Made tests more robust by limiting precision in places.
	- All of the above shall fix a lot of test failures seen recently
	  (strangely enough, Perl core behaviour changes were needed to trigger?).

2.001000
	- Correct defaults for txdinfo (--strict was on, which differed from the
	  rest). This changes non-buggy behaviour, so bump at least a minor version.

2.000004
	- Fix output format of txdrecycle test to avoide false negatives.
	- Change format of first txdcalc linear interpolation test to avoid
	  sensitivity to rounding mode. Should have chosen less regular input.

2.000003
	- A missing semicolon that broke the code on many installs of Perl
	  (but not mine, for a strange reason) got added.
	- Dependency on Math::Spline got officially added.

2.000002
	- Fix documentation for mentioning the correct list of shortcuts
	  in txdcalc (only x, y and z).

2.000001
	- inevitable documentation fix, finishing off a sentence

2.000000
	- initial release under the new name (replacing TextData-1.x)
