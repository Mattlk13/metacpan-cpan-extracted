NAME
    Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate - Filehandle tie to write to autorotated
    file with File::Write::Rotate

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.040 of Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate
    (from Perl distribution Tie-Handle-FileWriteRotate), released on
    2019-06-27.

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate;
     tie *FH, 'Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate',
         dir=>'/some/dir', prefix=>'myapp', size=>25*1024*1024, histories=>5;
     print FH "Logging a line\n";
     print FH "Logging another line\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module ties a filehandle to File::Write::Rotate object.

    I first wrote this module to tie STDERR, so that warnings/errors are
    logged to file instead of terminal (with autorotation, for good
    behavior).

TIPS
    To log warnings/errors to terminal *as well as* autorotated file, you
    can do something like this instead:

     my $fwr = File::Write::Rotate->new(...);
     $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {
         $fwr->write(~~localtime, " ", $_[0], "\n");
         warn $_[0];
     };
     $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {
         $fwr->write(~~localtime, " ", $_[0], "\n");
         die $_[0];
     };

METHODS
  TIEHANDLE classname, LIST
    Tie this package to file handle. "LIST" will be passed to
    File::Write::Rotate's constructor.
