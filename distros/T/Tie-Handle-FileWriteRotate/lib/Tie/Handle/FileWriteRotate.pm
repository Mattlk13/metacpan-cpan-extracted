=head1 NAME

Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate - Filehandle tie to write to autorotated file with File::Write::Rotate

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.03 of Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate (from Perl distribution Tie-Handle-FileWriteRotate), released on 2017-07-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate;
 tie *FH, 'Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate',
     dir=>'/some/dir', prefix=>'myapp', size=>25*1024*1024, histories=>5;
 print FH "Logging a line\n";
 print FH "Logging another line\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module ties a filehandle to L<File::Write::Rotate> object.

I first wrote this module to tie STDERR, so that warnings/errors are logged to
file instead of terminal (with autorotation, for good behavior).

=head1 TIPS

To log warnings/errors to terminal I<as well as> autorotated file, you can do
something like this instead:

 my $fwr = File::Write::Rotate->new(...);
 $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {
     $fwr->write(~~localtime, " ", $_[0], "\n");
     warn $_[0];
 };
 $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {
     $fwr->write(~~localtime, " ", $_[0], "\n");
     die $_[0];
 };

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TIEHANDLE classname, LIST

L<File::Write::Rotate>'s constructor.
