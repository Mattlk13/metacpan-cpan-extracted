NAME
    Tree::Dump - Dump a tree object

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.060 of Tree::Dump (from Perl
    distribution Tree-Dump), released on 2020-02-06.

SYNOPSIS
     use Tree::Dump; # exports td() and tdmp()
     td($tree);

    Sample output:

     (Tree::Example::HashNode) {_parent=>undef,id=>1,level=>0}
     |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>2,level=>1}
     |   \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub2) {id=>5,level=>2}
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>7,level=>3}
     |       |   \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub2) {id=>15,level=>4}
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>8,level=>3}
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>9,level=>3}
     |       \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>10,level=>3}
     |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>3,level=>1}
     |   \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub2) {id=>6,level=>2}
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>11,level=>3}
     |       |   \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub2) {id=>16,level=>4}
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>12,level=>3}
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>13,level=>3}
     |       \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>14,level=>3}
     \-- (Tree::Example::HashNode::Sub1) {id=>4,level=>1}

    Sample output when rendering an array-backed tree:

     (Tree::Example::ArrayNode) [undef,undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>","<obj>"]
     |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>"]
     |   \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub2) [undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>","<obj>","<obj>","<obj>"]
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>"]
     |       |   \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub2) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |       \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>"]
     |   \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub2) [undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>","<obj>","<obj>","<obj>"]
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>","<obj>"]
     |       |   \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub2) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |       |-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     |       \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]
     \-- (Tree::Example::ArrayNode::Sub1) [undef,undef,"<obj>"]

DESCRIPTION
    This module is useful for debugging. The interface is modeled after
    Data::Dmp (which in turn is modeled after Data::Dump). Instead of "dd",
    this module exports "td" which you can use to dump a tree object to
    STDOUT. There is also "tdmp" (like Data::Dmp's "dmp") which return
    dumped data in a string.

    Any tree object can be printed as long as it supports "parent" and
    "children" methods. See Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node for more
    information about the requirements.

FUNCTIONS
  td([ \%opts, ] $tree) => str
    Dump tree to STDOUT and return it. See "tdmp" for list of known options.

  tdmp([ \%opts, ] $tree) => str
    Return dumped tree. If first argument is a plain hashref, it will be
    regarded as options. Known options:

    *   get_children_method => str (default: children)

        Example:

         get_children_method => "get_children"

        By default, "children" is the method that will be used on node
        objects to retrieve children nodes. But you can customize that using
        this option. Note that the method must return either a list or
        arrayref of nodes.

    *   indent => int (default: 2)

        Number of spaces for each indent level.
