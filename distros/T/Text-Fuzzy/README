This is the README for Text::Fuzzy version 0.25.

Text::Fuzzy is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains
four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Text::Fuzzy - Partial string matching using edit distances

This module calculates edit distances between words, and searches
arrays and files to find the nearest entry by edit distance. It
handles both byte strings and character strings (strings containing
Unicode), treating each Unicode character as a single entity.

    
    use Text::Fuzzy;
    use utf8;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('あいうえお☺');
    print $tf->distance ('うえお☺'), "\n";
    # prints "2".
    


The default edit distance is the Levenshtein one, which counts each
addition ("cat" -> "cart"), substitution ("cat" -> "cut"), and
deletion ("carp" -> "cap") as one unit. The Damerau-Levenshtein edit
distance, which also allows transpositions ("salt" -> "slat") may
also be selected with the "transpositions_ok" method or the
"trans" option.

This module is particularly suited to searching for the nearest match
to a term over a list of words, using the "nearestv" or "nearest"
methods.

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Fuzzy
    * http://metacpan.org/release/Text-Fuzzy

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Text::Fuzzy
