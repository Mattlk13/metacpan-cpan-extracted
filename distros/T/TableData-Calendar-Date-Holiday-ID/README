SYNOPSIS
    To use from Perl code:

     use TableData::Calendar::Date::Holiday::ID;

     my $td = TableData::Calendar::Date::Holiday::ID->new;

     # Iterate rows of the table
     $td->each_row_arrayref(sub { my $row = shift; ... });
     $td->each_row_hashref (sub { my $row = shift; ... });

     # Get the list of column names
     my @columns = $td->get_column_names;

     # Get the number of rows
     my $row_count = $td->get_row_count;

    See also TableDataRole::Spec::Basic for other methods.

    To use from command-line (using tabledata CLI):

     # Display as ASCII table and view with pager
     % tabledata Calendar::Date::Holiday::ID --page

     # Get number of rows
     % tabledata --action count_rows Calendar::Date::Holiday::ID

    See the tabledata CLI's documentation for other available actions and
    options.

DESCRIPTION
    This table gets its data dynamically by querying
    Calendar::Indonesia::Holiday, so this is basically just a TableData
    interface for "Calendar::Indonesia::Holiday".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
