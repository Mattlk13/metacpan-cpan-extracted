 [ Other ]
 - Set up Storable hooks to play nice with Storable::dclone.
   Peter Valdemar Mørch++

 - Repackage with newer version of Dist::Inkt to fix META.json error.

0.008	2014-07-14

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Include a test case with a simple local implementation of Type::API.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Types::Standard and MooseX::Types::Moose are now just listed as
   'suggested' for testing. (They were 'required' and 'recommended'
   respectively.)

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Tie now passes through the type constraint's error message rather
   than generating its own. It will still generate its own error message if
   the type constraint object fails to provide a get_message method.
