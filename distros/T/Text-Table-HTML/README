NAME
    Text::Table::HTML - Generate HTML table

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.010 of Text::Table::HTML (from Perl
    distribution Text-Table-HTML), released on 2023-05-22.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::HTML;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123<456>'],
         ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],
         ['carol', 'brig gen', '8745'],
     ];
     print Text::Table::HTML::table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as HTML table. Its interface is modelled
    after Text::Table::Tiny 0.03.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

     <table>
     <thead>
     <tr><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th><th>Serial</th></tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
     <tr><td>alice</td><td>pvt</td><td>123&lt;456&gt;</td></tr>
     <tr><td>bob</td><td>cpl</td><td>98765321</td></tr>
     <tr><td>carol</td><td>brig gen</td><td>8745</td></tr>
     </tbody>
     </table>

COMPATIBILITY NOTES WITH TEXT::TABLE::TINY
    In "Text::Table::HTML", "header_row" is an integer instead of boolean.
    It supports multiple header rows.

    Cells in "rows" can be hashrefs instead of scalars.

FUNCTIONS
  table(%params) => str
  OPTIONS
    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows

        Required. Array of array of (scalars or hashrefs). One or more rows
        of data, where each row is an array reference. And each array
        element is a string (cell content) or hashref (with key "text" to
        contain the cell text or "raw_html" to contain the cell's raw HTML
        which won't be escaped further), and optionally other attributes:
        "rowspan", "colspan", "align", "bottom_border").

    *   caption

        Optional. Str. If set, will add an HTML "<caption>" element to set
        the table caption.

    *   header_row

        Optional. Integer. Default 0. Whether we should add header row(s)
        (rows inside "<thead>" instead of "<tbody>"). Support multiple
        header rows; you can set this argument to an integer larger than 1.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
