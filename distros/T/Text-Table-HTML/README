SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::HTML;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123<456>'],

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as HTML table.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

     <table>
     <thead>
     <tr><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th><th>Serial</th></tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
     <tr><td>alice</td><td>pvt</td><td>123&lt;456&gt;</td></tr>
     <tr><td>bob</td><td>cpl</td><td>98765321</td></tr>
     <tr><td>carol</td><td>brig gen</td><td>8745</td></tr>
     </tbody>
     </table>

FUNCTIONS
  table(%params) => str
  OPTIONS
    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows (aoaos)

        Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
        data, where each row is an array reference. And each array element
        is a string (cell content) or hashref (with key "text" to contain
        the cell text, and optionally attributes too like "rowspan",
        "colspan").
