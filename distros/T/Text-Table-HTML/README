VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Text::Table::HTML (from Perl
    distribution Text-Table-HTML), released on 2022-01-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::HTML;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123<456>'],
         ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],

     ];
     print Text::Table::HTML::table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as HTML table.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

     <table>
     <thead>
     <tr><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th><th>Serial</th></tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
     <tr><td>alice</td><td>pvt</td><td>123&lt;456&gt;</td></tr>
     <tr><td>bob</td><td>cpl</td><td>98765321</td></tr>
     <tr><td>carol</td><td>brig gen</td><td>8745</td></tr>
     </tbody>
     </table>

FUNCTIONS
  table(%params) => str
  OPTIONS
    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows (aoaos)

        Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
        data, where each row is an array reference. And each array element
        is a string (cell content) or hashref (with key "text" to contain
        the cell text, and optionally attributes too like "rowspan",
        "colspan").

    *   title

        Optional. Str. If set, will add an HTML "<caption>" element to set
        the table caption.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
