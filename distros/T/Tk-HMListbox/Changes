Revision history for Perl extension Tk::HMListbox.

3.00  Mon May 25, 2015
	- original version; Derived from Tk::SMListbox,
	  created by h2xs 1.23 with options -X -n Tk::SMListbox
3.10  Tue Jul 31, 2018
	- Added -headerbackground and -headerforeground config. options.
	- Added -fillcolumn option to specify the index of a column that 
	  should expand automatically to fill the additional screen 
	  realestate that results from expanding the width of the main 
	  widget.  If not specified the old behaviour of all columns 
	  remaining fixed width unless the separator is dragged by the user.
	- Depreciated used of -focuscolumn, though it still works, it 
	  appears to no longer have any functionally-useful purpose.
	  This is a carryover from Tk::SMListbox, where it still has 
	  usefulness.  See the updated docs.
	- Fixed a potential issue with -reversearrow and sorting.
	- Renamed internal packages to prevent potential conflicts with 
	  Tk::MListbox.
	- Cleaned up and updated docs along with the usual code cleanups.
3.11  Not Released
	- Fix minor focusing issue and make <Left-Tab> focus work properly.
3.12  Wed Jul 31, 2019
	- Added options:  -ipadx, -ipady, -tpadx, -tpady
	  See updated docs.  These provide padding values for image/imagetext 
	  and text fields respectively, primarily to assist in adjusting to 
	  keep icon and text columns' vertical allignment synced.
	  NOTE:  Requires Tk::HListbox v.2.3+ to use these new options.
3.13  Mon Jan 3, 2022
	- Remember item cursor is on & restore cursor when sorting.
3.20  Thu Jan 06, 2022
	- Added option:  -showcursoralways
	  See updated docs.  Tk::HMListbox (with Tk::HListbox v. 2.4+) no longer 
	  displays the keyboard cursor (active row) when the HMListbox widget 
	  does not have the keyboard focus, in order to be consistent with the 
	  behaviour of Tk::SMListbox and Tk::MListbox.  This option, when set to 1 
	  (or a "true" value) restores the pre-v3.20 behaviour of always showing 
	  the keyboard cursor.  NOTE:  Users should upgrade Tk::HListbox to at 
	  least v. 2.4 before or when upgrading to this version to ensure 
	  consistant behaviour (as I have not tested with prev. Tk::HListbox vsn)!
3.21  Thu Jan 06, 2022
	- Oops - Correct major error in Pod/Docs.
