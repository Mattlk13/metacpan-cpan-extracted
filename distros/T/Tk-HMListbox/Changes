Revision history for Perl extension Tk::HMListbox.

3.00  Mon May 25, 2015
	- original version; Derived from Tk::SMListbox,
	  created by h2xs 1.23 with options -X -n Tk::SMListbox
3.10  Tue Jul 31, 2018
	- Added -headerbackground and -headerforeground config. options.
	- Added -fillcolumn option to specify the index of a column that 
	  should expand automatically to fill the additional screen 
	  realestate that results from expanding the width of the main 
	  widget.  If not specified the old behaviour of all columns 
	  remaining fixed width unless the separator is dragged by the user.
	- Depreciated used of -focuscolumn, though it still works, it 
	  appears to no longer have any functionally-useful purpose.
	  This is a carryover from Tk::SMListbox, where it still has 
	  usefulness.  See the updated docs.
	- Fixed a potential issue with -reversearrow and sorting.
	- Renamed internal packages to prevent potential conflicts with 
	  Tk::MListbox.
	- Cleaned up and updated docs along with the usual code cleanups.
3.11  Not Released
	- Fix minor focusing issue and make <Left-Tab> focus work properly.
3.12  Wed Jul 31, 2019
	- Added options:  -ipadx, -ipady, -tpadx, -tpady
	  See updated docs.  These provide padding values for image/imagetext 
	  and text fields respectively, primarily to assist in adjusting to 
	  keep icon and text columns' vertical allignment synced.
	  NOTE:  Requires Tk::HListbox v.2.3+ to use these new options.
3.13  Mon Jan 3, 2022
	- Remember item cursor is on & restore cursor when sorting.
3.20  Thu Jan 06, 2022
	- Added option:  -showcursoralways
	  See updated docs.  Tk::HMListbox (with Tk::HListbox v. 2.4+) no longer 
	  displays the keyboard cursor (active row) when the HMListbox widget 
	  does not have the keyboard focus, in order to be consistent with the 
	  behaviour of Tk::SMListbox and Tk::MListbox.  This option, when set to 1 
	  (or a "true" value) restores the pre-v3.20 behaviour of always showing 
	  the keyboard cursor.  NOTE:  Users should upgrade Tk::HListbox to at 
	  least v. 2.4 before or when upgrading to this version to ensure 
	  consistant behaviour (as I have not tested with prev. Tk::HListbox vsn)!
3.21  Thu Jan 06, 2022
	- Oops - Correct major error in Pod/Docs.
4.00  Fri Jan 21, 2022
	- Add ability to set state to "disabled" (like other Tk widgets).
	- Add a "-disabledForeground" (color) option to override the default 
	  text foreground color used when the HListbox widget is set to disabled.
	- Fix "-listvariable" tiein to work properly with initial values specified 
	  in the tied array preinitialized with values when the HListbox is 
	  created (as Listbox works).
	- Fix some minor focus-traversal issues (when state is set to disabled).
	- Fix "-resizeable => 0", "-moveable => 0" and "-sortable => 0" options 
	  which seem to not be blocking resizing, moving, and sorting columns 
	  respectively in all cases (all are now disabled when HMListbox is 
	  disabled.
	- Fix failure to configure some options when set to zero (or a false 
	  value).
	- Fix failure of default binding on vertical scrollbar 
	  (Scrolled('HMListbox'...)) to scroll to the top of the list when the 
	  <Home> key pressed (<End> already scrolls to the bottom).  Also ensure 
	  that <Home> and <End> default to their proper actions:  Scroll the whole 
	  HMListbox *horizontally* to left / right edge unless the vertical 
	  scrollbar has focus, then scroll vertically to top / bottom.
	- Overhaul, check, & fix several minor inconsistancies between 
	  Tk::HMListbox and the other Listbox widgets, namely Tk::Listbox and 
	  Tk::HListbox.
	- Make sure to upgrade Tk::HListbox to it's latest version for best 
	  results, as most of these improvements depend on recent changes there!
