		     ptksh> o $w  opt1 opt2 ...    # accepts input like qw(...)
		  -  ptksh> o $w  /regexp/         # list all option of $w
							 matching regexp
		o ./.ptksh_init file sourced on startup
		o $ARGV[0] sourced on startup (please make sure there
		  is no MainLoop otherwise ptksh will hang)

	o FileEntry.pm & FcyEntry.pm
		o minor POD corrections additions
		o use Tk::<colname>() instead of hardcoded colors

	o ex/
		o added fcyentry example script

	o Start for application widgets (not ready for public)
		alpha/Tk/App.pm

	o FileEntry:  Creation of FileSelect is delayed until
	              it's really needed.
