NAME

    Test2::Plugin::IOSync - Load IOEvents and IOMuxer so that they work
    together.

DESCRIPTION

    This will load Test2::Plugin::IOMuxer and Test2::Plugin::IOEvents so
    that all writes to STDOUT and STDERR are turned into events. When
    formatters finally write their events the output will be duplicated
    into a muxed file so that it is possible to order the combined output.
    See Test2::Plugin::IOMuxer and Test2::Plugin::IOEvents for more
    details.

SYNOPSIS

        use Test2::Plugin::IOSync 'path/to/mux/file.txt';

    OR

        perl -MTest2::Plugin::IOSync=path/to/mux/file.txt test.t
