NAME
    Tree::From::Struct - Build a tree object from hash structure

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.040 of Tree::From::Struct (from Perl
    distribution Tree-From-Struct), released on 2020-02-04.

SYNOPSIS
    In your tree node class My/Person.pm:

     package My::Person;

     sub new {
         my $class = shift;
         my %args = @_;
         bless \%args, $class;
     }

     sub parent {
         my $self = shift;
         $self->{_parent} = $_[0] if $@;
         $self->{_parent};
     }

     sub children {
         my $self = shift;
         $self->{_children} = $_[0] if $@;
         $self->{_children};
     }

    In your code to build a tree:

     use Tree::From::Struct qw(build_tree_from_struct);

     # require all the used classes
     use My::Person;
     use My::MarriedPerson;
     use My::KidPerson;

     my $family_tree = build_tree_from_struct({
         _class => 'My::Person', name => 'Andi', age => 60, _children => [
             {name => 'Budi', age => 30},
             {_class => 'My::MarriedPerson', name => 'Cinta', _children => [
                  {class => 'My::KidPerson', name => 'Deni'},
                  {class => 'My::KidPerson', name => 'Eno'},
              ]},
         ]});

DESCRIPTION
    Building a tree manually can be tedious: you have to connect the parent
    and the children nodes together:

     my $root = My::TreeNode->new(...);
     my $child1 = My::TreeNode->new(...);
     my $child2 = My::TreeNode->new(...);

     $root->children([$child1, $child2]);
     $child1->parent($root);
     $child2->parent($root);

     my $grandchild1 = My::TreeNode->new(...);
     ...

    This module provides a convenience function to build a tree of objects
    in a single command. It connect the parent and children nodes for you.

    The class can be any class that provides "parent" and "children"
    methods. See Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node for more details.

FUNCTIONS
  build_tree_from_struct($struct) => obj
    This is basically Role::TinyCommons::Tree::FromStruct's
    "new_from_struct" presented as a function. See the role's documentation
    for more details on what you can put in $struct.
