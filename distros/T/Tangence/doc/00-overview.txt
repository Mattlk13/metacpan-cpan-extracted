An overview of Tangence
=======================

Tangence is all of the following:

 1. A single server/multiple client protocol for sharing information
    about objects.

 2. A data model - it defines the types of values that are transmitted
    between the server and clients.

 3. An object model - it defines the abstract look-and-feel of objects 
    that are visible in the server end, and the proxies to them that
    exist in the client ends.

 4. A wire protocol - it defines the bits down the wire of some stream.

 5. A collection of Perl modules (a Perl distribution) which implements
    all of the above.

These writings may sometimes suffer the "Java problem"; the problem of
the same name being applied to too many different concepts. I'll try to
make the context or wording clear to minimise confusions.
