Type-Tiny 1.002xxx or 1.004000
==============================

* Resolve RT#102457. Error::TypeTiny::Assertion needs a better way of
  identifying which stack frame to report the error at, or Type::Params
  needs to mark its compiled subs more clearly.

* Resolve RT#121763. Need to figure out the circumstances under which
  this happens and fix.


Type-Tiny 1.004000
==================

* December 2017 release date.

* Rewrite Type::Tiny::Manual.

* Resolve RT#120226 if HAARG will help me flesh out an API.

* Loosen the definition of FileHandle so that it accepts any references
  where Scalar::Util::openhandle($_) is true, not just unblessed GLOB
  references. (It also currently accepts blessed references where
  $_->isa('IO::Handle'). This will not change.)
  
  THIS CHANGE IS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE AND DIFFERS FROM MOOSE'S
  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME-NAMED TYPE CONSTRAINT. YOU ARE HEREBY
  WARNED!


Long-Term
=========

* Try to make inlining for ClassName, RoleName, StrMatch, etc more
  suitable for things like Mite. Perhaps add a separate method to type
  constraints for generating a string of Perl code that can be compiled
  and executed without the presence of Type::Tiny and the type library.
