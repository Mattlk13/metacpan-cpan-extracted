NAME
    Text::Column::Util - Utilities for displaying text in multiple columns

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of Text::Column::Util (from Perl
    distribution Text-Column-Util), released on 2021-03-02.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is written mainly to provide the functionality for
    column-run, a CLI script to run several commands in sequence and display
    their results side by side. It can handle ANSI color codes and wide
    Unicode characters.

    As alternatives to this module, you can also use modules that generate
    text table, like Text::Table::More. This module provides some
    conveniences like:

    *   finding out terminal width and setting column widths equally per
        each command;

    *   option to clip long output;

    *   option to specify text as coderef;

    *   option to display line number.

FUNCTIONS
  show_texts_in_columns
    Usage:

     show_texts_in_columns(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Show texts in columns.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   gen_texts => *code*

    *   linum_width => *posint*

        Line number width.

    *   num_columns => *posint*

        Required if you use _gen_texts instead of texts.

    *   on_long_line => *str* (default: "clip")

        What to do to long lines.

    *   separator => *str* (default: "|")

        Separator character between columns.

    *   show_linum => *bool*

        Show line number.

    *   texts => *array[str]*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
