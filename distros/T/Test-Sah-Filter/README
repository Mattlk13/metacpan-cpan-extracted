NAME
    Test::Sah::Filter - Test Data::Sah::Filter::* modules in distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Test::Sah::Filter (from Perl
    distribution Test-Sah-Filter), released on 2022-07-24.

SYNOPSIS
    To check a single Data::Sah::Filter::* module:

     use Test::Sah::Filter tests=>1;
     sah_filter_module_ok("Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::check", {opt => ...}, $msg);

    To check all Data::Sah::Filter::* modules in a distro:

     # save in release-sah-filter.t, put in distro's t/ subdirectory
     use Test::More;
     plan skip_all => "Not release testing" unless $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING};
     eval "use Test::Sah::Filter";
     plan skip_all => "Test::Sah::Filter required for testing Data::Sah::Filter::* modules" if $@;
     sah_filter_modules_ok({opt => ...}, $msg);

DESCRIPTION
    This module performs various checks on Data::Sah::Filter::* modules. It
    is recommended that you include something like "release-sah-filter.t" in
    your distribution if you add metadata to your code. If you use
    Dist::Zilla to build your distribution, there is
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Filter to make it easy to do so.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Some code taken from Test::Pod::Coverage by Andy Lester.

FUNCTIONS

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
