Tk::TextHighlight module changes log

04 august 2007
	Initial release - adding following new features to Tk::CodeText
	(no longer maintained, afaik):
	
	1)  Tk::Text::SuperText - like bracket highlighting / matching with vi-like 
	jump-to-matching bracket (Ctrl-p).

	2)  Added feature to auto-change rules-colors for rules whose color is the same as 
	the background color of the widget (to avoid invisible text).  The color is set to 
	either black or white depending on the brightness of the background color.

	3)  Fixed TextUndo-related bug to allow user to see text as he types past right-edge 
	of screen.

	4)  Added "setRule()" method to allow altering of individual rules by the programmer.

	5)  Modified right-click menu to allow saving of modified rules.

	6)  Added new options:  -noRulesMenu (dont show rules-menu in right-click menu), 
	-noSyntaxMenu, -noRulesEditMenu, -noSaveRulesMenu to prevent the corresponding items 
	from appearing in the right-click menu.  -noPlugInit - disables new feature #8 and 
	behaves as original CodeText.

	7) Fixed small bug w/auto-indenting.

	8) Fixed small bug w/rules-initialization when no .rules file present.

Tk::CodeText module changes log

	Improved documentation.

02 February 2003
	First alpha version 0.1

30 August 2007
	Initial v 1.0.0 release as "TextHighlight" by Jim Turner, now supporting 
	the Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate highlighting engine as well as the 
	current legacy CodeText highlighters.  Numerous other enhancements and 
	fixes have been made - see the README file for details.

02 September 2007
	Update to version 1.0.1
	1)  Fixed optional addition of Kate languages to the Syntax.View menus 
	to replace the "Kate" entry rather than just appending them to the end.
	2)  Fixed bug that caused infinite recursion when trying to start up 
	with the "None" highlight option.  See TextHighlight.pm and 
	ROTextHighlight.pm (line 244).

05 September 2007
	Update to version 1.0.2
	1)  Fix all internal packages to be under Tk::TextHighlight::*" to 
	fix "Unauthorized" Package namespace trespassing in CPAN.
	2)  Improve POD documentation.

December 2007
	Update to version 1.0.3
	Now will do highlighting somewhat in background freeing up most mouse 
	and keyboard actions while highlighting.  Also eliminated some redundant 
	re-highlighting.

06 February 2008
	Update to version 1.0.4
	Added binding to <Tab> to cause tab key to insert whatever string 
	"-indentchar" is set to (default is "\t").  Previously always 
	inserted "\t".

28 October 2008
	Update to version 1.0.5
	Added configure() function to first check for background changes and 
	change black, white, and matching rule colors to white or black to 
	prevent color contrast from making text illegable.

19 January 2016
	Update to version 1.1.0
	1) Fixed test failure when Syntax::Highlight::Perl was not installed  
	even when Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved was.  This module can use 
	either.  However, the TEST now requires that 
	Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved be installed as a prerequisite, since, 
	as of this writing, Syntax::Highlight::Perl is failing to build.
	2) Removed "Kate" from the [View].[Syntax] menu choices when 
	Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate is not installed.  This should prevent 
	some test failures and user program errors.  NOTE:  Kate is NOT 
	required to use this module, but provides highlighting for many more 
	languages.  Without Kate, this modules provides full highlighting for 
	Perl, Bash, Pod, and Xresources files.
	3) Other than that, just a few minor optimizations and cleanups.

19 January 2016
	Update to version 1.1.1
	Re-fix all internal packages to be under Tk::TextHighlight::*" to 
	fix "Unauthorized" Package namespace trespassing in CPAN.  Not sure 
	WHY this got undone somewhere.

13 June 2024
	Update to version 1.2
	1) Add "Select" option to Edit menu to select text between the cursor and 
	the current mouse location (when right-button pressed to popup the menu.
	2) ROTextHighlight - Remove "*Comment" and "*Indent" options from the Edit 
	menu since these modify text (in readonly mode)!
	3) Tidy up the POD docs a bit.

15 July 2024
	Update to version 2.0
	* Improve brace-matching/jumping by ignoring brace characters contained 
	within "comments", as defined by the syntax language.
	* The -commentchar option can now be a string, and certain special 
	comment strings:  "/*", "(*", and "<!--" are treated as multiline comments 
	(matching their respective closures:  "*/", "*)", and "-->" respectively) 
	greatly improving the auto-commenting of selected text method.
	* Add new readonly() method to allow toggling between standard (editable) 
	mode to readonly mode.  The popup-menu options that can alter text are 
	automatically greyed out now in -readonly mode.
	* NOTE:  ROTextHighlight.pm module REMOVED because it can now be replaced 
	by a symlink, and / or initialize TextHighlight widget with the 
	"-readonly => <true>").
	* Added -syntaxcomments flag to allow the -commentchar string to be set 
	by the selected language syntax's comment strings (for popular languages).
	* Added -smartindent flag to perform "smarter" intenting in most modern 
	programming languages (when Enter is pressed in or after a line.
	* Added -noPopupMenu flag to replace the popup menu (Mouse-button-3) with 
	selection extend.
	* Improve some key-bindings, such as adding <Control-P> (upper case) to 
	both 	jump to a matching brace but also highlight the text in between, and 
	<Control-m> to pop up the popup menu (unless -noPopupMenu is true).
	* Fix some issues when settnig or changing the background color.
	* Added getViewMenu() method to return just the "View" menu normally in 
	the popup menu options.
	* Added EmptyDocument() method to allow the document to be cleared, ie. 
	delete('0.0','end), but can be used in -readonly mode too.
	* The insertTab() method now inserts the value of "-indentchar" instead 
	of always the tab character (use insertTabChar() to force insertion of the 
	tab character ("\t"), (ie. if -indentchar is set to spaces);
	* Major documentation overhaul to include all the methods and options.
	* Misc. general minor code fixes and cleanups.
