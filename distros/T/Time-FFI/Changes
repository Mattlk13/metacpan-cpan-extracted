  - Clarify that mktime may adjust any elements of the passed tm record.
  - Renamed with_extra method for Time::FFI::tm to normalized and clarify that
    it also normalizes out-of-range values when interpreting as local time.
  - Allow epoch and to_object methods for Time::FFI::tm to normalize
    out-of-range values when interpreting as local time.

1.002     2019-10-10 16:17:27 EDT
  - Added timelocal and timegm functions where available.

1.001     2019-10-10 13:58:11 EDT
  - Added from_object constructor for Time::FFI::tm.

1.000     2019-10-10 12:19:57 EDT
  - Fixed bugs in Time::FFI::tm->to_object where the tm object may be mutated
    and the results may be incorrect when interpreted in the local time zone.
  - Documented that the tm_mday and tm_isdst members of a new Time::FFI::tm
    record should be set explicitly.
  - Documented that mktime adjusts the tm_isdst, tm_wday, tm_yday, and possibly
    tm_gmtoff and tm_zone members of the passed tm record.
  - Initialize tm_mday to 1 and tm_isdst to -1 in the tm record returned by
    strptime, rather than the defaults of 0.
  - Added epoch method to Time::FFI::tm to return the associated Unix epoch
    timestamp.
  - Added with_extra method to Time::FFI::tm to return a new tm record with
    extra values populated.
