NAME
    Text::NonWideChar::Util - Utility routines for text

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Text::NonWideChar::Util (from
    Perl distribution Text-NonWideChar-Util), released on 2021-04-16.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::NonWideChar::Util qw(
         length_height);

     # get length as well as number of lines
     say mbswidth_height("one\ntwo\nthree"); # => [5, 3]

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the non-wide version of some of the routines in
    Text::WideChar::Util.

FUNCTIONS
  length_height($text) => [INT, INT]
    This is the non-wide version of "mbswidth_height()" and can be used if
    your text only contains printable ASCII characters and newlines.

FAQ
  Why split functionalities of wide character and color support into multiple modules/distributions?
    Performance (see numbers in the function description), dependency
    (Unicode::GCString is used for wide character support), and overhead
    (loading Unicode::GCString).
