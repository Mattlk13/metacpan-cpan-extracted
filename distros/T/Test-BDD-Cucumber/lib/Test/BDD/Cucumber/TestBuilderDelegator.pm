# Original fix and investigation all by https://github.com/tomas-zemres - based
# on Test::Tester::Delegate. Original patch here:
#
#   https://github.com/pherkin/test-bdd-cucumber-perl/pull/61
#
# which I have unfortunately butchered in order to understand and adapt it.

# Some modules - like Test::Exception - start off by taking a local reference to
# the Test::Builder singleton:
#
#    my $Tester = Test::Builder->new;
#
# ... which later confounds our efforts to `local`ise $Test::Builder::Test.
# This module provides a wrapper that we can put in to $Test::Builder::Test
# early, and that we can redirect calls to.
