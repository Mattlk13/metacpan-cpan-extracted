    v0.001

SYNOPSIS

      my $t = Test::Mojo->with_roles('+StopOnFail')->new('MyApp');
    
      $t->get_ok('/')->status_is(200);

DESCRIPTION

    When you have many tests, you may want to stop the test suite after the
    first failure. This modules does a Test::More::BAIL_OUT, like the
    die_on_fail on Test::Most behavior.

CAVEATS

    The Test::Mojo::or() function only run when $t->success is FALSE.
    Unconsciously, this module removed the purpose of this function, after
    all, a BAIL_OUT would be threw before.
