VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::Require::ProgramInPath 'gcc';

     program_runs ['gcc', 'foo.c'];

DESCRIPTION

    This is skip unless a particular program can be found in the PATH.
    Under the covers File::Which is used. This is a subclass of
    Test2::Require.

METHODS

 skip

    Should not be invoked directly, but returns `undef` if the test should
    not be skipped and a string containing the reason why the test was
    skipped. Currently `This test only runs if $program is in the PATH` is
    returned.
