NAME
    Text::Table::Sprintf - Generate simple text tables from 2D arrays using
    sprintf()

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Text::Table::Sprintf (from Perl
    distribution Text-Table-Sprintf), released on 2020-08-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::Sprintf;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123456'],
         ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],
         ['carol', 'brig gen', '8745'],
     ];
     print Text::Table::Sprintf::table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as a simple text table.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

     +-------+----------+----------+
     | Name  | Rank     | Serial   |
     +-------+----------+----------+
     | alice | pvt      | 123456   |
     | bob   | cpl      | 98765321 |
     | carol | brig gen | 8745     |
     +-------+----------+----------+

    This module models its interface on Text::Table::Tiny 0.03, employs the
    same technique of using "sprintf()", but takes the technique further by
    using a single large format and "sprintf" the whole table. This results
    in even more performance gain (see benchmark result or benchmark using
    Acme::CPANModules::TextTable).

    Caveats: make sure each row contains the same number of elements.
    Otherwise, the table will not be correctly formatted (cells might move
    to another row/column).

FUNCTIONS
  table
    Usage:

     my $table_str = Text::Table::Sprintf::table(%params);

    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows (aoaos)

        Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
        data, where each row is an array reference.

    *   header_row (bool)

        If given a true value, the first row in the data will be interpreted
        as a header row, and separated from the rest of the table with a
        ruled line.
