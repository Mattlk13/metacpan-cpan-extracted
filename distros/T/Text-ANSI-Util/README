DESCRIPTION
    This module provides routines for dealing with text that contains ANSI
    color codes, e.g. for determining its length/width (excluding the color
    codes), stripping the color codes, extracting the color codes, and so
    on.

    For functions that support wide characters, see Text::ANSI::WideUtil.

    Current caveats:

    *   Other ANSI codes (non-color codes) are ignored

        These are codes like for altering cursor positions, etc.

    *   Single-character CSI (control sequence introducer) currently ignored

        Only "ESC+[" (two-character CSI) is currently parsed.

        BTW, in ASCII terminals, single-character CSI is 0x9b. In UTF-8
        terminals, it is "0xc2, 0x9b" (2 bytes).

    *   Private-mode- and trailing-intermediate character currently not
        parsed

    *   Only color reset code \e[0m is recognized

        For simplicity, currently multiple SGR parameters inside a single
        ANSI color code is not parsed. This means that color reset code like
        "\e[1;0m" or "\e[31;47;0m" is not recognized, only "\e[0m" is. I
        believe this should not be a problem with most real-world text out
        there.

FUNCTIONS
  ta_add_color_resets(@text) => LIST
    Make sure that a color reset command (add "\e[0m") to the end of each
    element and a replay of all the color codes from the previous element,
    from the last color reset) to the start of the next element, and so on.
    Return the new list.

    This makes each element safe to be combined with other array of text
    into a single line, e.g. in a multicolumn/tabular layout. An example:

    Without color resets:

     my @col1 = split /\n/, "\e[31mred\nmerah\e[0m";
     my @col2 = split /\n/, "\e[32mgreen\e[1m\nhijau tebal\e[0m";

     printf "%s | %s\n", $col1[0], $col2[0];
     printf "%s | %s\n", $col1[1], $col2[1];

    the printed output:

     \e[31mred | \e[32mgreen
     merah\e[0m | \e[1mhijau tebal\e[0m

    The "merah" text on the second line will become green because of the
    effect of the last color command printed ("\e[32m"). However, with
    ta_add_color_resets():

     my @col1 = ta_add_color_resets(split /\n/, "\e[31mred\nmerah\e[0m");
     my @col2 = ta_add_color_resets(split /\n/, "\e[32mgreen\e[1m\nhijau tebal\e[0m");

     printf "%s | %s\n", $col1[0], $col2[0];
     printf "%s | %s\n", $col1[1], $col2[1];

    the printed output ("<...>") marks the code added by
    ta_add_color_resets():

     \e[31mred<\e[0m> | \e[32mgreen\e[1m<\e[0m>
     <\e[31m>merah\e[0m | <\e[32m\e[1m>hijau tebal\e[0m

    All the cells are printed with the intended colors.

  ta_detect($text) => BOOL
    Return true if $text contains ANSI color codes, false otherwise.

  ta_extract_codes($text) => STR
    This is the opposite of "ta_strip()", return only the ANSI codes in
    $text.

  ta_highlight($text, $needle, $color) => STR
    Highlight the first occurrence of $needle in $text with <$color>, taking
    care not to mess up existing colors.

    $needle can be a string or a Regexp object.

    Implementation note: to not mess up colors, we save up all color codes
    from the last reset ("\e[0m") before inserting the highlight color +
    highlight text. Then we issue "\e[0m" and the saved up color code to
    return back to the color state before the highlight is inserted. This is
    the same technique as described in "ta_add_color_resets()".

  ta_highlight_all($text, $needle, $color) => STR
    Like "ta_highlight()", but highlight all occurrences instead of only the
    first.

  ta_length($text) => INT
    Count the number of characters in $text, while ignoring ANSI color
    codes. Equivalent to "length(ta_strip($text))". See also:
    "ta_mbswidth()" in Text::ANSI::WideUtil.

  ta_length_height($text) => [INT, INT]
    Like "ta_length()", but also gives height (number of lines). For
    example, "ta_length_height("foobar\nb\n")" gives "[6, 3]".

    See also: "ta_mbswidth_height()" in Text::ANSI::WideUtil.

  ta_pad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR
    Return $text padded with $padchar to $width columns. $which is either
    "r" or "right" for padding on the right (the default if not specified),
    "l" or "left" for padding on the right, or "c" or "center" or "centre"
    for left+right padding to center the text.

    $padchar is whitespace if not specified. It should be string having the
    width of 1 column.

    Does *not* handle multiline text; you can split text by "/\r?\n/"
    yourself.

    See also: "ta_mbpad()" in Text::ANSI::WideUtil.

  ta_split_codes($text) => LIST
    Split $text to a list containing alternating ANSI color codes and text.
    ANSI color codes are always on the second element, fourth, and so on.
    Example:

     ta_split_codes("");              # => ()
     ta_split_codes("a");             # => ("a")
     ta_split_codes("a\e[31m");       # => ("a", "\e[31m")
     ta_split_codes("\e[31ma");       # => ("", "\e[31m", "a")
     ta_split_codes("\e[31ma\e[0m");  # => ("", "\e[31m", "a", "\e[0m")
     ta_split_codes("\e[31ma\e[0mb"); # => ("", "\e[31m", "a", "\e[0m", "b")
     ta_split_codes("\e[31m\e[0mb");  # => ("", "\e[31m\e[0m", "b")

    so you can do something like:

     my @parts = ta_split_codes($text);
     while (my ($text, $ansicode) = splice(@parts, 0, 2)) {
         ...
     }

  ta_split_codes_single($text) => LIST
    Like "ta_split_codes()" but each ANSI color code is split separately,
    instead of grouped together. This routine is currently used internally
    e.g. for "ta_wrap()" and "ta_highlight()" to trace color reset/replay
    codes.

  ta_strip($text) => STR
    Strip ANSI color codes from $text, returning the stripped text.

  ta_substr($text, $pos, $len[ , $replacement ]) => STR
    A bit like Perl's "substr()". If $replacement is not specified, will
    return the substring. If $replacement is specified, will return $text
    with the substring replaced by $replacement.

    See also: "ta_mbsubstr()" in Text::ANSI::WideUtil.

  ta_trunc($text, $width) => STR
    Truncate $text to $width columns while still including all the ANSI
    color codes. This ensures that truncated text still reset colors, etc.

    Does *not* handle multiline text; you can split text by "/\r?\n/"
    yourself.

    See also: "ta_mbtrunc()" in Text::ANSI::WideUtil.

  ta_wrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR
    Like Text::WideChar::Util's "wrap()" except handles ANSI color codes.
    Perform color reset at the end of each line and a color replay at the
    start of subsequent line so the text is safe for combining in a
    multicolumn/tabular layout.

    Options:

    *   flindent => STR

        First line indent. See Text::WideChar::Util for more details.

    *   slindent => STR

        First line indent. See Text::WideChar::Util for more details.

    *   tab_width => INT (default: 8)

        First line indent. See Text::WideChar::Util for more details.

    *   pad => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, will pad each line to $width. This is convenient if
        you need the lines padded, saves calls to ta_pad().

    *   return_stats => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, then instead of returning the wrapped string,
        function will return "[$wrapped, $stats]" where $stats is a hash
        containing some information like "max_word_width", "min_word_width".

    Performance: ~500/s on my Core i5 1.7GHz laptop for a ~1KB of text (with
    zero to moderate amount of color codes).

FAQ
  How do I highlight a string case-insensitively?
    You can currently use a regex for the $needle and use the "i" modifier.
    Example:

     use Term::ANSIColor;
     ta_highlight($text, qr/\b(foo)\b/i, color("bold red"));
