NAME
    Tie::Array::IntSpan - Tied-array interface for Array::IntSpan

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Tie::Array::IntSpan (from Perl
    distribution Tie-Array-IntSpan), released on 2021-08-29.

SYNOPSIS
     use Array::IntSpan;
     use Tie::Array::IntSpan;

     my $intspan = Array::IntSpan->new([0, 59, 'F'], [60, 69, 'D'], [80, 89, 'B']);
     tie my @ary, 'Tie::Array::IntSpan', $intspan;

     # use the array like a regular one
     say for @ary;
     print join("", @ary[81,65,0]); # => "DBF"
     $ary[30] = 'C'; # breaks up the first range

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides tied-array interface for Array::IntSpan. It might
    be convenient if you want to access an "Array::IntSpan" object like a
    regular Perl array. But note that the tied-array interface does not
    expose the full power of the "Array::IntSpan", e.g. you cannot create a
    new range or directly modify whole ranges. That's why you pass the
    "Array::IntSpan" object when you initialize the tied array, so you can
    access the object directly to do things you can't do with the tie
    interface.

    Caveats:

    *   Does not handle negative range (e.g. [-5, -1, 'foo']) well

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
