0.08  Sun Sep 13, 2015
  - Remove Term::EditLine2
    The original language was the module would be deprecated but
    not before September 12, 2015, but it should have been
    "Term::EditLine2 IS deprecated, but will not be REMOVED before
    September 12, 2015".  I apologize for the wording, though I
    still feel that the migration to be dead simple, and the number
    of users using Term::EditLine is probably zero.
