    - Fix test output/diagnostics between XML::LibXML and XML::Parser

0.11 2023-07-21
    - Various test suite updates, no code changes, no need to upgrade

0.10 2023-01-20
    - Add a XML::LibXML version number if we find it installed
      This is to hunt down spurious test failures with an unknown version
      of XML::LibXML
    - Upgrade package/distribution infrastructure
    - No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.09 2013-02-06

      and RT 70099
  - Apply patch from RT 42072 by gyles19@visi.com

0.07 2003-12-30
  - Fixed test bug reported by Kate Pugh (KAKE):
    t/09-errors.xpath.t was missing a SKIP: label
  - still no resolution on the other reported errors, as XML::XPath "works"
    on my Win32 machine, but dosen't work elsewhere :-(

    Most of the failures seem to be failures due to different text output
    of the tests:

    # #   <p foo="bar" />
    vs.
    # #   <p foo="bar"/>

    but as I can't replicate them here, it's hard to fix those :-(

  + Added $parsing_method to allow XML to be tested as well.

0.06 2003-12-22
  - Fixed tests against XML::XPath
  - added another test testing the internal abstraction
    API and differences between XML::XPath and XML::LibXML

0.05 2003-12-04
  - Added XPath functionality (xpath_ok, no_xpath, xpath_count)
  - Added fallback to old functionality if neither XML::LibXML nor
    XML::XPath are available
  - refactored code to have less duplication, at the cost of
    some functions passed as parameters (this shouldn't bother you,
    as it is all hidden)

0.04 lost in the void

0.03  Mon Sep 23 2002
  - Fixed Pod (Thanks to Andy Lester)
  - Added a test for the synopsis (Thanks to Andy Lester)
  - Added a test for Pod consistency (Thanks to Andy Lester and brian d foy)
  - Added text_ok(), no_text() and text_count()
  - Fixed reporting of errors to the correct level. Errors now
    get reported in your test file instead of somewhere within
    Content.pm

  - Renamed from Test::HTML to Test::HTML::Content
  - Added warnings for the module again, if available
