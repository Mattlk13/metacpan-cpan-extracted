# Release

## Requirements

- Minilla
- PAUSE account

## (Optional) Update Changes

Though you can update it during `minil release`, I recommend to write the changelog before executing it.

## Do release

```
minil release
```

## Check release

- email should be sent to your from PAUSE
- https://twitter.com/cpan_new
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::WWW::Stub

It takes while until the relaese is available for install.
