NAME
    Tables - Specification for Tables::*, modules that contains table data

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.1

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.1.1 of Tables (from Perl distribution
    Tables), released on 2020-06-01.

SYNOPSIS
    Use one of the "Tables::*" modules.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY SPECIFICATION; THINGS WILL STILL CHANGE A LOT.

    "Tables::*" modules are modules that contain two-dimensional table data.
    The table can be accessed via a standard interface (see
    TablesRole::Spec::Basic). An example of table data would be list of
    countries along with their names and country code, or a list of CPAN
    authors along with their published email addresses.

    Why put data in a Perl module, as a Perl distribution? To leverage the
    Perl/CPAN toolchain and infrastructure: 1) ease of installation, update,
    and uninstallation; 2) allowing dependency expression and version
    comparison; 3) ease of packaging further as OS packages, e.g. Debian
    packages (converted from Perl distribution); 4) testing by CPAN Testers.

    The table data can actually be stored as CSV in the DATA section of a
    Perl module, or as a CSV file in a shared directory of a Perl
    distribution, or a Perl structure in the module source code, or from
    other sources.

    The standard interface provides a convenient and consistent way to
    access the data, from accessing the rows, getting the column names, and
    dumping to CSV or Perl structure for other tools to operate on.

    To get started, see TablesRole::Spec::Basic and one of existing
    "Tables::*" module.

NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION
    "Tables" (this module) is the specification.

    "TablesRole::*" the roles.

    All the modules under "Tables::*" will be modules with actual table
    data.

SEE ALSO
    WordList is an older, related project. Where "WordList" packages a list
    of strings as Perl module, "Tables" tries to do the same for table data.

    Modules and CLIs that manipulate table data: TableData::Object, td (from
    App::td).
