NAME
    Text::DumbTemplate - Yet another template system, this one's dumb but
    fast

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Text::DumbTemplate (from Perl
    distribution Text-DumbTemplate), released on 2017-08-16.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::DumbTemplate;

     my $td = Text::DumbTemplate->new(
     );

     $td->template(<<'_');
     Hello, good [%= greeting %]!
     My name is [%= name %].
     I am [%= age %] year(s) old.
     Nice to meet you.
     _

     $td->var(greeting => 'morning');
     $td->var(name => 'Ujang');
     $td->var(age => 25);

     print $td->process;

DESCRIPTION
    EARLY, EXPERIMENTAL, PROOF OF CONCEPT.

    This is a very simple template module. One thing that's unique about
    this module is: it compiles template to a "sprintf" format instead of
    Perl subroutines. The upside: it's blazing fast (e.g. several times
    faster than Template::Compiled for small/simple template).
