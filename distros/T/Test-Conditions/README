Test-Conditions

The purpose of this module is to facilitate testing complex data structures such as trees, lists
of hashes, results of database queries, etc. You may want to run certain tests on each node or
row, and report the results in a compact way.  You might, for example, wish to test a list or
other structure with 1,000 nodes and report the result as a single test rather than multiple
thousands of individual tests. This module provides a far more flexible approach than the
'is_deeply' method of Test::More.

An object of class Test::Conditions can keep track of any number of conditions, and generates a
single TAP event when its 'ok_all' method is called. Under the most common usage, the test fails if
one or more conditions are flagged, and succeeds if none are.  Each condition which has been flagged
is reported as a separate diagnostic message.  Futhermore, if the nodes or other pieces of the
data structure have unique identifiers, you can easily arrange for Test::Conditions to report the
identifier of one of the failing nodes to help you in diagnosing the problem.
