NAME
    Types::HTML5 - types for parsing strings of HTML into DOMs

SYNOPSIS
       package My::Page {
          use Moo;
          use Types::HTML5 -types;
      
          has template => (
             is      => 'ro',
             isa     => HtmlTree,
             coerce  => 1,
          );
      
          sub output_page {
             ...;
          }
       }

STATUS
    This is still at a very early stage of development and has *no test suite*
    yet.

DESCRIPTION
    This type library provides useful type constraints and coercions for
    working with HTML5::DOM and XML::LibXML.

  Type Constraints
    `HtmlTree`
        A blessed HTML::DOM::Tree object. Coercions from HTML5::DOM::Document
        objects, XML::LibXML::Document objects, HTML5::DOM::Element objects,
        strings of HTML or XHTML, filehandles, and Path::Tiny objects.

    `HtmlDocument`
        A blessed HTML::DOM::Document object. Coercions from HTML5::DOM::Tree
        objects, XML::LibXML::Document objects, HTML5::DOM::Element objects,
        strings of HTML or XHTML, filehandles, and Path::Tiny objects.

    `HtmlElement`
        A blessed HTML5::DOM::Element object. Can coerce from
        XML::LibXML::Element objects.

    `HtmlComment`
        A blessed HTML5::DOM::Comment object. Can coerce from
        XML::LibXML::Comment objects and plain strings.

    `HtmlText`
        A blessed HTML5::DOM::Text object. Can coerce from XML::LibXML::Text
        objects and plain strings.

    `XmlDocument`
        A blessed XML::LibXML::Document object. Coercions from
        HTML5::DOM::Tree objects, HTML5::DOM::Document objects,
        HTML5::DOM::Element objects, strings of HTML or XHTML, filehandles,
        and Path::Tiny objects.

    `XmlElement`
        A blessed XML::LibXML::Element object. Can coerce from
        HTML5::DOM::Element objects.

    `XmlComment`
        A blessed XML::LibXML::Comment object. Can coerce from
        HTML5::DOM::Comment objects and plain strings.

    `XmlText`
        A blessed XML::LibXML::Text object. Can coerce from HTML5::DOM::Text
        objects and plain strings.

  Convenience Functions
    `str_to_html($str)`
        Converts a string of HTML to an HTML5::DOM::Tree.

    `str_to_xml($str)`
        Converts a string of HTML to an XML::LibXML::Document.

    `html_to_xml($node)`
        Converts from an HTML5::DOM node to an XML::LibXML node. Supports text
        nodes, comments, elements, documents, and trees.

    `xml_to_html($node)`
        Converts from an XML::LibXML node to a HTML5::DOM node. Supports text
        nodes, comments, elements, and documents. (XML::LibXML::Document
        becomes HTML5::DOM::Tree, not HTML5::DOM::Document.)
