Revision history for Test2-Tools-DOM

0.100     2024-06-16 20:21:46+01:00 Europe/London

* Minor documentation changes.

0.004004  2024-06-11 22:19:34+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

* Bump minimum required version of Test2::Suite to 0.000084

0.004003  2024-06-11 21:03:49+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

* Make DOM checker call-aware: the standard 'call' function from
  Test2::Tools::Compare can be used to make calls on the underlying
  Mojo::DOM58 object, as if we were using an object checker

0.004002  2024-06-10 21:54:14+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

* Re-instate runtime dependencies that were moved to the test
  phase in the previous release. Since this is a Test2::Tools
  distribution, those are always needed.

0.004001  2024-06-10 17:48:27+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

* Set Test2::Tools::DOM::Check to stringify what the test 'got'
  for each delta. This should result in better error diagnostics,
  since results will now render the partial DOM at each failing
  step.
* Use new intercept API in tests, provided by Test2::API v.1302180
* Bump minimal dependency on Mojo::DOM58 to a non-trial release

0.004     2024-06-07 17:37:02+01:00 Europe/London

* Fixed an issue with tests that explicitly checked for attributes
  set to the empty string
* Added the 'val' method as a shortcut to the 'value' attribute

0.003     2022-03-18 09:08:51+00:00 Europe/London

* Fixed missing entry in this change log for previous version

0.002     2022-03-18 08:53:05+00:00 Europe/London
