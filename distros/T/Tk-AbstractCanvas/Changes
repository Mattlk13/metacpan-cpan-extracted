      * could not do VERSION 1.10 since same as 1.1 and 1.12 is still less
      than 1.8, but probably would work if I had started with 1.01 or 'v'
      instead

      * added Tk to required in Makefile and METAs, and put eval use Tk in
      01podc.t to hopefully resolve newest CPANTesters failure on make test

    - 1.8 H79M9Rot Sun Jul 9 09:27:50:55 -0500 2017

      * removed broken Build.PL to resolve
      <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122404>. (Thank you,

    - 1.6 H78MEDIC Sat Jul 8 14:13:18:12 -0500 2017
