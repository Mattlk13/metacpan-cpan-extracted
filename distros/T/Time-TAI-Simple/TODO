Things to do:

   * Switch from LWP::Simple to HTTP::Tiny (qv /home/ttk/.irclog.freenode-perl 2016-09-28)

   * Instead of [Prereqs] in dist.ini, use [Prereqs::FromCPANfile] and don't list prereqs there.
     This means I can just maintain the prereqs in cpanfile and eliminate some redundancy.

   * Write a thinger that checks for leapsecond updates and emails me, so I can update this
     module in a timely fashion.  Hasn't been necessary so far because I've noticed in advance 
     when the IERS made rumblings about inserting a new leapsecond.

   * Add some smarts to occasionally check for clock skew and introduce creeping adjustments.
     Some clocks have a lot of skew.  Most generic motherboard crystals are rated to about
     50ppm, so may drift up to 4 seconds per day, and even very good expensive crystals are only
     rated to 2ppm.  Skew rate may be influenced by transient temperature and ground plane state,
     so need to be careful about assumptions.
