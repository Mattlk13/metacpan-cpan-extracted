        Times are now formatted more consistently:
          * Primary units (e.g. 'm', 'ms', 'h') are aligned
          * Including if leading digits are higher than expected
          * Secondary units (e.g. 's', 'min') are also aligned
          * All times are padded to be an equal length

    [Bug fixes]

        Uses floating-point with no decimal places rather than integers to
        round values rather than truncate them, something which was
        (a) inaccurate, and (b) could vary between Perls, depending on how
        large floating point values were.
        
        Compiles under perl 5.8.9.

        You can supply a coderef to time instead of a function name; the
        resulting wrapped coderef is returned to you.
    
        You can supply the name of a function in your own package to
        time_function() without having to fully-quantify it.
        
        You can supply an alternate name to use in reports instead of the
        function name you specified. This is most obviously useful when you
        supply a coderef.
        
    [Bug fix]
    
        Some functions weren't marked as exportable: add_milestone was
        misspelled; generate_intermediate_report and generate_final_report
        were omitted entirely.
        
        Functions weren't being unwrapped when timing stopped.
