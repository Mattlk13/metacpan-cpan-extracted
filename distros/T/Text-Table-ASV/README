NAME
    Text::Table::ASV - Generate TSV

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Text::Table::ASV (from Perl
    distribution Text-Table-ASV), released on 2018-07-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::ASV;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123456'],
         ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],
         ['carol', 'brig gen', '8745'],
     ];
     print Text::Table::TSV::table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as ASV. This is basically a way to
    generate ASV using the same interface as that of Text::Table::Tiny
    (v0.03) or Text::Table::Org.

    ASV (ASCII separated values, also sometimes DEL a.k.a. Delimited ASCII)
    is a format similar to TSV (tab separated values). Instead of Tab
    character ("\t") as the field separator, ASV uses "\x1f" (ASCII Unit
    Separator character) and instead of newline ("\n") as the record
    separator, ASV uses "\x1e" (ASCII Record Separator). There is currently
    no quoting or escaping mechanism provided. "\x1c", "\x1d", "\x1e", and
    "\x1f" characters in cell will be replaced by spaces.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table (the
    record separator and unit separator are shown using "\x1f" and "\x1f"
    respectively):

     Name\x1fRank\x1fSerial\x1ealice\x1fpvt\x1f123456\x1ebob\x1fcpl\x1f98765321\x1ecarol\x1fbrig gen\x1f8745

FUNCTIONS
  table(%params) => str
  OPTIONS
    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows (aoaos)

        Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
        data, where each row is an array reference.
