Module: Text::CSV::Unicode

Description:
    Text::CSV::Unicode builds on Text::CSV to provides facilities for the 
    composition and decomposition of comma-separated values.  
    Text::CSV::Unicode handles input that includes 8-bit (and more) data.

    It is based on version 0.01 of Text::CSV, but has been reimplemented
    to use the current Text::CSV.
