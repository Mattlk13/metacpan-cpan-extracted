Module: Text::CSV::Unicode

Description:

    Text::CSV::Unicode builds on Text::CSV to provides facilities for the 
    composition and decomposition of comma-separated values.  
    Text::CSV::Unicode handles input that includes 8-bit (and more) data.

    It is based on version 0.01 of Text::CSV, but has been reimplemented
    to use the current Text::CSV.

Recent Changes:

    v0.400 2018-10-02
	Removed Base.pm
	base.t tests empty Text::CSV::Base class
	Refactored Unicode.pm

    v0.300 2018-09-28
	Text::CSV::Unicode does not use Text::CSV::Base
	Text::CSV::Base is redundant
	Text::CSV::Unicode does not set C<always_quote => 1>
	Text::CSV::Unicode C<binary => 1> is deprecated

    v0.201 2018-09-25
	Add C<use warnings> to t/unicode.t: 
	deprecate was not a default warning before perl 5.18.0, 
	so the 'deprecated' test had been failing on earlier perls.

	Completely rewritten to use Text::CSV
	Allow unicode but not Cntrl in Text::CSV::Unicode
