Module: Text::CSV::Unicode

Description:
    Text::CSV::Unicode builds on Text::CSV to provides facilities for the 
    composition and decomposition of comma-separated values.  
    Text::CSV::Unicode handles input that includes 8-bit (and more) data.

    It is based on version 0.01 of Text::CSV, but has been reimplemented
    to use the current Text::CSV.

Recent Changes:

    v0.200 2018-09-21
	Completely rewritten to use Text::CSV
	Allow unicode but not Cntrl in Text::CSV::Unicode
	Allow all unicode with binary=>1, by dropping through to Text::CSV
	combine() with undef produces different output: t/combine-undef.t
	version() provided by Text::CSV::Version 
		- test as class method: t/unicode.t

    v0.201 2018-09-25
	Add C<use warnings> to t/unicode.t: 
		deprecate was not a default warning before perl 5.18.0, 
		so the 'deprecated' test had been failing on earlier perls.
	Use C<warnings::warnif()>
	Better punctuation in the t/unicode.t tests
