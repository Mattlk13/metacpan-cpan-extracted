NAME
    `Tickit::Widget::SegmentDisplay' - show a single character like a
    segmented display

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides a widget that immitates a segmented LED or LCD
    display. It shows a single character by lighting or shading fixed
    rectangular bars.

STYLE
    The default style pen is used as the widget pen, though only the
    background colour will actually matter as the widget does not directly
    display text.

    The following style keys are used:

    lit => COLOUR
    unlit => COLOUR
        Colour descriptions (index or name) for the lit and unlight segments
        of the display.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
       $segmentdisplay = Tickit::Widget::SegmentDisplay->new( %args )

    Constructs a new `Tickit::Widget::SegmentDisplay' object.

    Takes the following named arguments

    value => STR
            Sets an initial value.

    type => STR
            The type of display. Supported types are:

            seven
                A 7-segment bar display. The display can also be blanked
                with the value " ".

            seven_dp
                A 7-segment bar display with decimal-point. To light the
                decimal point, append the value with ".".

            colon
                A static `:'

            symb
                A unit, prefix symbol or other character. The following
                characters are recognised:

                  V A W Ω F H s
                  G M k m µ n p
                  + - %

                Each will be drawn in a style approximately to fit the
                general LED shape display, by drawing lines of erased cells.
                Note however that some more intricate shapes may not be very
                visible on smaller scales.

    use_unicode => BOOL
            If true, use Unicode block-drawing characters. If false, use
            only coloured erase cells using the background colour.

    use_halfline => BOOL
            If true, vertical resolution of rendered block characters is
            effectively doubled by using half-filled Unicode block-drawing
            characters. Setting this option implies `use_unicode'.

    thickness => INT
            Gives the number of columns wide and half-lines tall that LED
            bars will be drawn in. Note that unless `use_halfline' is set,
            this value ought to be an even number. Defaults to 2.

ACCESSORS
  value
       $value = $segmentdisplay->value

       $segmentdisplay->set_value( $value )

    Return or set the character on display
