    - Work around changed Getopt::Long 2.51 behaviour
        Getopt::Long 2.51 fixed its documented behaviour ("--" is kept
        in the argument list if "pass_through" is specified). Previous
        versions removed it. Term::CLI now checks for the Getopt::Long
        version and adapts where necessary.
