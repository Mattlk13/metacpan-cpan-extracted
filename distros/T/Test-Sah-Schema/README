NAME
    Test::Sah::Schema - Test Sah::Schema::* modules in distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.016 of Test::Sah::Schema (from Perl
    distribution Test-Sah-Schema), released on 2023-09-03.

SYNOPSIS
    To check a single Sah::Schema::* module:

     use Test::Sah::Schema tests=>1;
     sah_schema_module_ok("Sah::Schema::Foo", {opt => ...}, $msg);

    To check all Sah::Schema::* modules in a distro:

     # save in release-sah-schema.t, put in distro's t/ subdirectory
     use Test::More;
     plan skip_all => "Not release testing" unless $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING};
     eval "use Test::Sah::Schema";
     plan skip_all => "Test::Sah::Schema required for testing Sah::Schema modules" if $@;
     sah_schema_modules_ok({opt => ...}, $msg);

DESCRIPTION
    This module performs various checks on Sah::Schema::* modules. It is
    recommended that you include something like "release-sah-schema.t" in
    your distribution if you add metadata to your code. If you use
    Dist::Zilla to build your distribution, there is
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas to make it easy to do so.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Some code taken from Test::Pod::Coverage by Andy Lester.

FUNCTIONS
    All these functions are exported by default.

  sah_schema_module_ok($module [, \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Load $module, get its $schema, and perform test on it.

    Available options:

    *   test_schema_examples => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to test examples in schema.

  sah_schema_modules_ok([ \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Look for modules in directory "lib" (or "blib" instead, if it exists),
    and "run sah_schema_module_ok()" on each of them.

    Options are the same as in sah_schema_module_ok(), plus:

    *   include_modules

    *   exclude_modules

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
