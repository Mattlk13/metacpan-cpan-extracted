Test::NoTty
===========

Test your code that handles failure to open /dev/tty

On a *nix system the special file /dev/tty always exists, and opening it gives
you a(nother) file handle attached to your controlling terminal. This is useful
if you want direct user input, such as entering passwords or passphrases, even
if STDIN or STDOUT are redirected.

But what happens if your code is running non-interactively? Such as servers,
cron jobs, or just CPAN testers? /dev/tty still exists, but opening it will
fail. Your tests need to cover this case. But how do you test your tests as you
write them, when you're running them in a terminal session?

That's the purpose of this module. With it you can interactively run code
without a controlling terminal, to test those code paths.
