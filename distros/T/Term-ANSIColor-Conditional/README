NAME
    Term::ANSIColor::Conditional - Colorize text only if color is enabled

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of Term::ANSIColor::Conditional
    (from Perl distribution Term-ANSIColor-Conditional), released on
    2020-03-21.

SYNOPSIS
    Use as you would Term::ANSIColor.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a wrapper for Term::ANSIColor. If color is enabled then
    everything is the same as Term::ANSIColor. If color is disabled, then
    "color()" will emit empty string and "colored()" will not colorize input
    text.

    How to determine "color is enabled":

    *   If package variable $Term::ANSIColor::Conditional::COLOR is defined,
        use that.

    *   Otherwise, check if "NO_COLOR" environment variable exists. If yes,
        color is disabled.

    *   Otherwise, check if "COLOR" environment variable is defined and use
        that.

    *   Otherwise, check if (-t STDOUT) is true (interactive terminal). If
        yes, color is enabled.

    *   Otherwise, color is disabled.

    Note that Term::ANSIColor already supports conditional color via the
    "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED" environment variable, but it does not supports
    the "more standard" "NO_COLOR" and "COLOR", and it also does not check
    or interactive terminal.
