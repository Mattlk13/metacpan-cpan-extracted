NAME
    Term::ANSIColor::Conditional - Colorize text only if color is enabled

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Term::ANSIColor::Conditional
    (from Perl distribution Term-ANSIColor-Conditional), released on
    2017-10-28.

SYNOPSIS
    Use as you would Term::ANSIColor.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a wrapper for Term::ANSIColor. If color is enabled then
    everything is the same as Term::ANSIColor. If color is disabled, then
    "color()" will emit empty string and "colored()" will not colorize input
    text.

    How to determine "color is enabled":

    *   If package variable $Term::ANSIColor::Conditional::COLOR is defined,
        use that.

    *   Otherwise, check if "COLOR" environment variable is defined and use
        that.

    *   Otherwise, check if (-t STDOUT) is true (interactive terminal). If
        yes, color is enabled.

    *   Otherwise, color is disabled.

VARIABLES
  $COLOR => bool
