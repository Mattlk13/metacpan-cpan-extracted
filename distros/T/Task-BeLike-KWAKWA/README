    Install Term::ReadLine::Gnu. You'll likely need libreadline-dev or
    readline-devel to have actual readline support.

            # ~/.replyrc
        script_line1 = use strict
            script_line2 = use warnings
            script_line3 = use 5.024000

 Testing

    Testing is hard to get right. Consider when writing tests which
    category the test falls under and test and organise appropriately.
    Typically they can be categorized as integration tests (how major parts
    of a system work together), unit tests (exercising modules),
    functional/user acceptance tests (use case scenarios, BDD).

    Avoid using if statements. If your tests have branches, your tests need
    tests.
