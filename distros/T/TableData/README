NAME
    TableData - Specification for TableData::*, modules that contains table
    data

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.2

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.2.1 of TableData (from Perl
    distribution TableData), released on 2021-06-01.

SYNOPSIS
    Use one of the "TableData::*" modules.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY SPECIFICATION; THINGS WILL STILL CHANGE A LOT.

    "TableData::*" modules are modules that contain two-dimensional table
    data. The table can be accessed via a standard interface (see
    TableDataRole::Spec::Basic). An example of table data would be list of
    countries along with their names and country code, or a list of CPAN
    authors along with their published email addresses.

    Why put data in a Perl module, as a Perl distribution? To leverage the
    Perl/CPAN toolchain and infrastructure: 1) ease of installation, update,
    and uninstallation; 2) allowing dependency expression and version
    comparison; 3) ease of packaging further as OS packages, e.g. Debian
    packages (converted from Perl distribution); 4) testing by CPAN Testers.

    The table data can actually be stored as CSV in the DATA section of a
    Perl module, or as a CSV file in a shared directory of a Perl
    distribution, or a Perl structure in the module source code, or from
    other sources.

    The standard interface provides a convenient and consistent way to
    access the data, from accessing the rows, getting the column names, and
    dumping to CSV or Perl structure for other tools to operate on.

    To get started, see TableDataRole::Spec::Basic and one of existing
    "TableData::*" module.

NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION
    "TableData" (this module) is the specification.

    All the modules under "TableData::*" are modules with actual table data.
    The entity mentioned in the module name should be singular, not plural
    (e.g. "TableData::Person::AcmeInc" instead of
    "TableData::Persons::AcmeInc" or "TableData::People::AcmeInc".

    More specific subnamespaces for more specific types of table data:

    *   "TableData::Locale::*" for locale-related data

        Examples: "TableData::Locale::Country" (list of countries in the
        world), TableData::Locale::US::State (list of US states),
        "TableData::Locale::ID::Province" (list of Indonesian provinces).

    *   "TableData::Lingua::*" for human-language-related data

        Examples: TableData::Lingua::Word::EN::Adjective::TalkEnglish (list
        of top adjectives from talkenglish.com website, along with some
        other data like frequency). All "TableData::Lingua::Word::*" modules
        should contain the column "word" so they are usable from
        applications like word games.

    "TableDataRole::*" the roles.

    "TableDataRoles::*" is the name for distribution that contain several
    role modules.

    "TableDataBase::*" for base classes.

    "TableDataBases::*" is the name for distribution that contain several
    "TableDataBase" modules.

    "TableDataBundle-*" name for distribution that contains several
    "TableData" modules.
