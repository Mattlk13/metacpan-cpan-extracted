NAME
    TableData - Specification for TableData::*, modules that contains table
    data

SPECIFICATION VERSION
    0.2

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.2.2 of TableData (from Perl
    distribution TableData), released on 2022-11-29.

SYNOPSIS
    Use one of the "TableData::*" modules.

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY SPECIFICATION; THINGS WILL STILL CHANGE A LOT.

    "TableData::*" modules are modules that contain two-dimensional table
    data. The table can be accessed via a standard interface (see
    TableDataRole::Spec::Basic). An example of table data would be list of
    countries along with their names and country code, or a list of CPAN
    authors along with their published email addresses.

    Why put data in a Perl module, as a Perl distribution? To leverage the
    Perl/CPAN toolchain and infrastructure: 1) ease of installation, update,
    and uninstallation; 2) allowing dependency expression and version
    comparison; 3) ease of packaging further as OS packages, e.g. Debian
    packages (converted from Perl distribution); 4) testing by CPAN Testers.

    The table data can actually be stored as CSV in the DATA section of a
    Perl module, or as a CSV file in a shared directory of a Perl
    distribution, or a Perl structure in the module source code, or from
    other sources.

    The standard interface provides a convenient and consistent way to
    access the data, from accessing the rows, getting the column names, and
    dumping to CSV or Perl structure for other tools to operate on.

    To get started, see TableDataRole::Spec::Basic and one of existing
    "TableData::*" module.

NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION
  TableData
    "TableData" (this module) is the specification.

    All the modules under "TableData::*" are modules with actual table data.
    The entity mentioned in the module name should be singular, not plural
    (e.g. "TableData::Person::AcmeInc" instead of
    "TableData::Persons::AcmeInc" or "TableData::People::AcmeInc".

    More specific subnamespaces for more specific types of table data are
    described in entries below.

  TableData::Locale::*
    For locale-related data.

    Examples: "TableData::Locale::Country" (list of countries in the world),
    TableData::Locale::US::State (list of US states),
    "TableData::Locale::ID::Province" (list of Indonesian provinces).

  TableData::Lingua::*
    For human-language-related data

    Examples: TableData::Lingua::Word::EN::Adjective::TalkEnglish (list of
    top adjectives from talkenglish.com website, along with some other data
    like frequency). More specific "TableData::Lingua::*" subnamespaces are
    described in entries below.

  TableData::Lingua::Word::*
    All "TableData::Lingua::Word::*" modules should contain the column
    "word" so they are usable from applications like word games.

  TableData::Lingua::Dict::*
    For dictionaries.

    Examples: TableData::Lingua::Dict::ID::KBBI,
    TableData::Lingua::Dict::ZH::Proverb::StarDict,
    TableData::Lingua::Dict::FR_EN::FreeDict.

    All "TableData::Lingua::Dict::*" modules should contain the columns
    "entry" and "description".

  TableDataRole::*
    The roles.

  TableDataRoles::*
    "TableDataRoles::*" are names for distributions that contains several
    role modules.

  TableDataBase::*
    For base classes.

  TableDataBases::*
    "TableDataBases::*" are names for distributions that contain several
    "TableDataBase" modules.

  TableDataBundle::*
    "TableDataBundle::*" are names for distributions that contain several
    "TableData" modules. The subnamespaces can follow that of "TableData".

    Examples: TableDataBundle::Perl::CPAN::Release which contains
    TableData::Perl::CPAN::Release::Static and
    TableData::Perl::CPAN::Release::Static::FromNewest.
    TableDataBundle::Software::License which contains
    TableData::Software::License::FromRPL and
    TableData::Software::License::FromSL.

RELATED NAMESPACES
  Data::TableData::*
    Modules that contain code to work with table data (not necessarily table
    data in "TableData::" modules).

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
