NAME

Tuple::Munge - manipulate Perl's tuple object representations

DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to manipulate Perl's tuples, the data
structures that were introduced in Perl 5.37.9 to support the core class
system.  As of Perl 5.37.10, the Perl core notably lacks both general
manipulation facilities and documentation for these data structures.

Tuple data structures are experimental, so the feature could change
significantly or disappear entirely in future versions of Perl.
Be mindful of the portability issues (requiring a recent Perl and having
doubtful forward portability) in any decision about whether to use tuples.
