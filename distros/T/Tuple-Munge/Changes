version 0.001; 2023-04-12

  * bugfix: when peephole optimising tuple_slot/tuple_set_slot followed
    by an rv2xv op, don't assume that the rv2xv op will remain largely
    unchanged by later peephole optimisation

  * bugfix: in the optimised version of tuple_slot/tuple_set_slot followed
    by rv2gv, if the slot value references a `fake' glob copy, yield a
    `real' copy of the glob copy, as a real rv2gv op does, rather than
    the glob copy itself

  * when peephole optimising tuple_slot/tuple_set_slot followed by an
    rv2xv op, incorporate the whole rv2xv job into the tuple-related op,
    rather than punt tricky cases at runtime to the rv2xv op
