    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS

        # add the `shelf` command
        $ task-kusarigama add Command::Shelf
    
        # Shelf all tasks in the Lazy-List project
        $ task shelf put project:List-Lazy
    
        # Retreieve all the tasks in the Lazy-List project
        $ task shelf get project:List-Lazy
    
        # Individual tasks can be shelved or retrieved
        $ task shelf 28
        $ task shelf get 28
    
        # filter shelved tasks from next report
        $ task config report.next.filter '!shelved:true status:pending limit:papge'

DESCRIPTION

    Sometimes projects aren't just put on the back burner, they're entirely
    put on hold. For these times the shelf command sets a shelved uda
    allowing those tasks to be filtered out.

    Without specifying get or put the shelf command defaults to put.

    The shelf commands work with any filtering that is supported by
    Taskwarrior <http://taskwarrior.org/>.
