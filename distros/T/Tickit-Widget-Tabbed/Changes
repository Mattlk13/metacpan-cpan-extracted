0.019     2015-06-11 23:23:15
          [CHANGES]
           * Avoid using pen observers and instead provide a $tab->set_pen
             method to set a pen for a tab. This is a short-term temporary
             measure until a better solution is found, likely involving the
             style system.

          [CHANGES]

          [BUGFIXES]
           * Remember to declare that sum0 needs List::Util 1.26

           * Fix off-by-one error that causes Alt+{digit} shortcut to crash

0.016     2014-08-06 16:10:44
          [BUGFIXES]
           * Use List::Util::sum0 instead of sum so as not to print undef
             warnings when there are no tabs defined
