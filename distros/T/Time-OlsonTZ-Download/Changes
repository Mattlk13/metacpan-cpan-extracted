version 0.007; 2017-10-23

  * when extracting data file names from the Olson makefile, handle the
    new way in which the data file names are handled there from version
    2017c onwards

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * in documentation, use four-column indentation for all verbatim
    material

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker

  * support author test through Build interface

version 0.006; 2017-07-17

  * when invoking make in the Olson distribution directory, suppress
    rebuilding of the version file, to cope with copies of the
    distribution in which timestamps have been mangled, or which are git
    working directories for projects other than the Olson database, or
    from which some version-contributing files (such as the copyrighted
    ones) have been omitted

version 0.005; 2017-07-16

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Net::FTP

  * accept non-ASCII UTF-8 strings in iso3166.tab, seen from tzdata
    version 2015e onwards, consequently increasing the Perl version
    requirement to 5.8

  * avoid unescaped brace in regexp, which is deprecated starting in
    Perl 5.21.1

  * in documentation, indicate that the ->new_from_local_source
    constructor accepts multiple attribute parameters

  * new author test to try out the module's actual functionality (not
    automatically run due to dependence on network and on the content
    of the latest Olson distribution)

  * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution

version 0.004; 2012-07-20

  * switch to new official repository, <ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/releases/>

version 0.003; 2012-03-19

  * new constructor ->new_from_local_source to support working with
    locally-modified Olson source

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

version 0.002; 2011-10-09

  * with elsie down due to legal action, use instead the new de facto
    canonical repository, <ftp://munnari.oz.au/pub/>

  * new methods ->code_version and ->data_version to retrieve the version
    numbers of the two parts of the distribution independently

  * abandon support for HTTP-based archive, instead using the archive
    on the same FTP site as the current version (which munnari supplies
    but elsie didn't)

  * handle archived versions with two-digit year and those compressed with
    compress rather than gzip

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.001; 2010-11-18

  * accept a tzcode version number that is lower than the available
    tzdata version number on elsie

version 0.000; 2010-08-31

  * initial released version
