        - major rewrite of t/01_basic.t
          * added SKIP if tested globs are not tty
          * removed wrong assumption that STDIN
            would always match STDERR
          * test implicit argument, *STDIN, *STDERR
            e *STDOUT
        - tuned the answers for non-tty arguments:
          tests are still missing
