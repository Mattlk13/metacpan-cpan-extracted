Revision history for Perl extension Tk::JThumbnail.

2.00  Thu Mar 21 19:48:37 2019
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -n Tk::JThumbnail
	  Started with v2.0 since we're both a fork and a continuation of 
	  Tk::Thumbnail.

2.01  Sun Mar 24, 2019
	- Fix segfault if clear() called followed by configure(-images => \@files).
	- Touch up the docs a bit.
	- Include proper license files.
2.1   Thu Mar 19, 2020
	- (Hopefully) FIX all remaining SegFaults on bad/non image files.
	- Fix some selection-issues.
	- Add default bindings for <space> and <Shift-space> to make work
	  like <Button-1> and <Shift-Button-1>.
	- Add selectionIncludes() and selectionAnchor() functions to match
	  those found in Tk::*MListbox widgets.
2.2
	- Add Balloon option (-iballoons => 1|0) to specify show popup balloons
	  showing the file-name when mousing over an image.
	- Add -iborder, -ihighlightthickness, -irelief, -iactiverelief, and
	  -ianchor options to specify the border, relief, etc. values for the 
	  icon buttons.
	- Add -iwrap option (-iwrap => -1,0,1,2,3,4,64..., default -1) to cause
	  the text labels to be wrapped (requires -ilabels => 1(true)).
	  -1 (default) - no wrapping, 0 - calculate sensible default, 1-4: wrap
	  width is 1x..4x the icon width, 64+:set the wrap width to that many
	  pixels.  5-63: set wrap to 64 pixels.
	- Add -font option to specify the font to use.  Default is the
	  proportional sans font selected by Perl/Tk.
	- Add "-state" option, can be either "normal" or "disabled":
	  (In other words add ability to disable the entire widget).
	- Add a '-1' option value to the -columns parameter to have
	  JThumbnail calculate the number of columns based on the window-size
	  and the widths of the icon buttons (including wrapped file-name
	  text labels, if -ilabels => 1(true) specified such that the window is
	  filled horizontally without the need for horizontal scrolling.
	  (NOTE:  -iwidth => (>0), and either -iwrap => (>=0) or -ilabels => 0
	  must also be specified for this to work!
	- Properly initialize anchor and selecting/deselecting mode for more 
	  consistant multi-selecting/deselecting.
	- Enable drag-selecting to scroll the visible window!
	- Make the "default" (-command => undef) mouse-button down function
	  work more user-friendly when selecting/deselecting.
	- Misc. code cleanups.
2.3
	- Fix index() function not accepting integer values, namely zero (0) 
	  (like *Listbox modules) as raw zero-based indices into the list.
	- Also added decimal numbers to allow for specifying specific zero-based 
	  row.column indices, which will return the equivalent raw index# for a 
	  specific item.  Bounds checking is done in both cases.
