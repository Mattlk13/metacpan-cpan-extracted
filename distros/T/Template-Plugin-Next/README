SYNOPSIS

    This is a plugin for the Template Toolkit distribution that allows the
    inclusion of template files with identical relative paths like the
    present template. Those templates are 'hidden' by the present template,
    because their respective INCLUDE_PATH entries are dominated by the one
    of the including template.

    The functionality provided by this plugin might come handy in multi
    skin situations where default templates are selectively redefined by a
    skin using a dominating INCLUDE_PATH entry for the skin and identical
    relative paths to the templates as with the default templates - thus
    hiding them.

    The Next-plugin allows to include the dominated default templates from
    inside the hiding template in order to decorate the default template or
    include a parameterized version of it.

    Example:

      # We assume: INCLUDE_PATH='/templates/c:/templates/b:/templates/a'
    
      # template a/test.tt (note this template accepts a "parameter" called 'repeat'):
      [% repeat = repeat || 1; 'a' | repeat(repeat) %]
      
      # template b/test.tt:
      b
      [% USE Next; Next.include( repeat => 3 ); %]
      b
      
      # template c/test.tt:
      c
      [% USE Next; Next.include(); %]
      c
    
      # a call to template test.tt
      [% INCLUDE test.tt %]
      
      # would yield something like the following (with POST_CHOMP set to 1):
      
      c
      b
      aaa
      b
      c

EXPORT

    Exported stash variable: Next_

METHODS

 process

    Includes the 'next' dominated template with an identical relative path
    like the one this plugin method is called from. It accepts named
    parameters like its TT directive counterpart PROCESS that will result
    in stash variables.

 include

    Same as process() but with stash localisation.

CAVEATS

      * INCLUDE_PATH stability is required during a single call to
      Template::process().

      * Only template providers of class Template::Provider are supported.
