DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a set of tools for checking Type::Tiny types. This
    is similar to Test::TypeTiny, but works against the Test2::Suite and
    has more functionality for testing and troubleshooting coercions.

FUNCTIONS

    All functions are exported by default.

 Wrappers

  type_subtest

        type_subtest Type, sub {
            my $type = shift;
    
            ...
        };

    Creates a buffered subtest with the given type as the test name, and
    passed as the only parameter. Using a generic $type variable makes it
    much easier to copy and paste test code from other type tests without
    accidentally forgetting to change your custom type within the code.

    If the type can be inlined, this will also run two separate subtests
    (within the main type subtest) to check both the inlined constraint and
    the slower coderef constraint. The second subtest will have a
    inline-less type, cloned from the original type. This is done by
    stripping out the inlined constraint (or generator) in the clone.

    The tester sub will be used in both subtests. If you need the inlined
    constraint for certain tests, you can use the $type->can_be_inlined
    method to check which version of the test its running. However, inlined
    checks should do the exact same thing as coderef checks, so keep these
    kind of exceptions to a minimum.

    Note that it doesn't do anything to the parent types. If your type
    check is solely relying on parent checks, this will only run the one
    subtest. If the parent checks are part of your package, you should
    check those separately.

 Testers

    These functions are most useful wrapped inside of a "type_subtest"
    coderef.

    Note that most of these checks will run through get_message and
    validate_explain calls to confirm the coderefs don't die. If you need
    to validate the error messages themselves, consider using checks
    similar to the ones in the "SYNOPSIS".

  should_pass_initially

        should_pass_initially($type, @values);

    Creates a buffered subtest that confirms the type will pass with all of
    the given @values, without any need for coercions.

  should_fail_initially

        should_fail_initially($type, @values);

    Creates a buffered subtest that confirms the type will fail with all of
    the given @values, without using any coercions.

    This function is included for completeness. However, items in
    should_fail_initially should realistically end up in either a
    "should_fail" block (if it always fails, even with coercions) or a
    "should_coerce_into" block (if it would pass after coercions).

  should_pass

        should_pass($type, @values);

    Creates a buffered subtest that confirms the type will pass with all of
    the given @values, including values that might need coercions. If it
    initially passes, that's okay, too. If the type does not have a
    coercion and it fails the initial check, it will stop there and fail
    the test.

    This function is included for completeness. However,
    "should_coerce_into" is the better function for types with known
    coercions, as it checks the resulting coerced values as well.

  should_fail

        should_fail($type, @values);

    Creates a buffered subtest that confirms the type will fail with all of
    the given @values, even when those values are ran through its
    coercions.

  should_coerce_into

        should_coerce_into($type, @orig_coerced_kv_pairs);

    Creates a buffered subtest that confirms the type will take the "key"
    in @orig_coerced_kv_pairs and coerce it into the "value" in
    @orig_coerced_kv_pairs. (The @orig_coerced_kv_pairs parameter is
    essentially an ordered hash here, with support for ref values as the
    "key".)

    The original value should not pass initial checks, as it would not be
    coerced in most use cases. These would be considered test failures.

  should_sort_into

        should_sort_into($type, @sorted_arrayrefs);

    Creates a buffered subtest that confirms the type will sort into the
    expected lists given. The input list is a shuffled version of the
    sorted list.

    Because this introduces some non-deterministic behavior to the test, it
    will run through 100 cycles of shuffling and sorting to confirm the
    results. A good sorter should always return a deterministic result for
    a given list, with enough fallbacks to account for every unique case.
    Any failure will immediate stop the loop and return both the shuffled
    input and output list in the failure output, so that you can
    temporarily test in a more deterministic manner, as you debug the
    fault.

TROUBLESHOOTING

 Test name output

    The test names within each should_* function are somewhat dynamic,
    depending on which stage of the test it failed at. Most of the time,
    this is self-explanatory, but double negatives may make the output a
    tad logic-twisting:

        not ok 1 - ...
    
        # should_*_initially
        "val" should pass                        # simple should_pass_initially failure
        "val" should fail                        # simple should_fail_initially failure
    
        # should_*
        "val" should fail (initial check)        # should_fail didn't initially fail
        "val" should pass (no coercion)          # should_pass initally failed, and didn't have a coercion to use
        "val" should pass (failed coercion)      # should_pass failed both the check and coercion
        "val" should fail (coerced into "val2")  # should_fail still successfully coerced into a good value
        "val" should pass (coerced into "val2")  # should_pass coerced into a bad value
    
        # should_coerce_into has similar errors as above

  Type Map Diagnostics

    Because types can be twisty mazes of inherited parents or multiple
    coercion maps, any failures will produce a verbose set of diagnostics.
    These come in two flavors: constraint maps and coercion maps, depending
    on where in the process the test failed.

    For example, a constraint map could look like:

        # (some definition output truncated)
    
        MyStringType constraint map:
            MyStringType->check("value") ==> FAILED
                is defined as: do { package Type::Tiny; ... ) }
            StrMatch["(?^ux:...)"]->check("value") ==> FAILED
                is defined as: do { package Type::Tiny; !ref($_) and !!( $_ =~ $Types::Standard::StrMatch::expressions{"..."} ) }
            StrMatch->check("value") ==> PASSED
                is defined as: do { package Type::Tiny; defined($_) and do { ref(\$_) eq 'SCALAR' or ref(\(my $val = $_)) eq 'SCALAR' } }
            Str->check("value") ==> PASSED
                is defined as: do { package Type::Tiny; defined($_) and do { ref(\$_) eq 'SCALAR' or ref(\(my $val = $_)) eq 'SCALAR' } }
            Value->check("value") ==> PASSED
                is defined as: (defined($_) and not ref($_))
            Defined->check("value") ==> PASSED
                is defined as: (defined($_))
            Item->check("value") ==> PASSED
                is defined as: (!!1)
            Any->check("value") ==> PASSED
                is defined as: (!!1)

    The diagnostics checked the final value with each individual parent
    check (including itself). Based on this output, the value passed all of
    the lower-level Str checks, because it is a string. But, it failed the
    more-specific StrMatch regular expression. This will give you an idea
    of which type to adjust, if necessary.

    A coercion map would look like this:

        MyStringType coercion map:
            MyStringType->check("value") ==> FAILED
            FQDN->check("value") ==> FAILED
            Username->check("value") ==> FAILED
            Hostname->check("value") ==> PASSED (coerced into "value2")

    The diagnostics looked at Type::Coercion's type_coercion_map (and the
    type itself), figured out which types were acceptable for coercion, and
    returned the coercion result that passed. In this case, none of the
    types passed except Hostname, which was coerced into value2.

    Based on this, either Hostname converted it to the wrong value (one
    that did not pass MyStringType), or one of the higher-level checks
    should have passed and didn't.
