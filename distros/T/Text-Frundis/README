"frundis" intends to be a semantic markup language with a roff-like syntax for
supporting authoring of a variety of light to medium weight documents, from
novels to technical tutorials.

It comes with a script utility frundis(1), and a module interface
Text::Frundis.

Install
-------

The simplest way to install install frundis is to use the cpan or cpanm tools
in the distribution root directory:

	$ cpan .

or from CPAN:

	$ cpan Text::Frundis

The examples/, tools/ and docs/ directories can also be copied, for the purpose
of packaging, to a shared directory such as /usr/local/share/frundis or
whatever suits better your platform, but are not necessary.

Dependencies
------------

- Perl (see http://www.perl.org) and some core modules.
- URI cpan module
- if the Data::UUID cpan module is present, it will be used for epub generation
  to use a UUID as the unique identifier of the generated epub (otherwise, a
  warning will be raised, and a not so unique identifier will be generated).
