I need feedback on the functionality of the module on different platforms and
operating systems. On Debian-based systems, or on Ubuntu and Mint-based systems,
it will certainly always work. 

The following informations are helpful:

Function:          yes/no

Hardware Platform: e.g. ARM, Intel or AMD etc.

Operating System:  e.g. Ubuntu or Mint etc. (including version number)

Terminal:          Process / path and recognised name from module 

<p>Following informations are optional:</p>

<p>Version of Perl</p>

<p>Version of ps</p>
