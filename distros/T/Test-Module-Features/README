NAME
    Test::Module::Features - Test feature set specifications and features
    declarations

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Test::Module::Features (from
    Perl distribution Test-Module-Features), released on 2021-02-26.

SYNOPSIS
    To check a single a module:

     use Test::Module::Features;
     module_features_in_module_ok("Foo::Bar", {opt => ...}, $msg);

    Alternatively, you can check all modules in a distro:

     # save in release-module-features.t, put in distro's t/ subdirectory
     use Test::More;
     plan skip_all => "Not release testing" unless $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING};
     eval "use Test::Module::Features";
     plan skip_all => "Test::Module::Features required for testing feature set specifications and features declarations" if $@;
     module_features_in_all_modules_ok({opt => ...}, $msg);

DESCRIPTION
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Some code taken from Test::Pod::Coverage by Andy Lester.

FUNCTIONS
    All these functions are exported by default.

  module_features_in_module_ok
    Usage:

     module_features_in_module_ok($module [, \%opts ] [, $msg])

    Load $module and perform test on module's feature set specifications
    and/or features declarations.

    Available options:

  module_features_in_all_modules_ok
    Usage:

     module_features_in_all_modules_ok([ \%opts ] [, $msg])

    Look for modules in directory "lib" (or "blib" instead, if it exists),
