=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a C<Test::Routine>-based role for testing C<Dist::Zilla> and its plugins. It creates
F<dist.ini> file with specified content in a temporary directory, populates the directory with
specified files, runs "release" command with testing version of C<Dist::Zilla> in the temporary
directory, checks actual exception and log messages do match expected ones, and let you write other
checks specific for your plugin.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 Release

This is a test routine. It runs C<dzil release>, and then:

=over

=item *

If expected C<exception> is specified (see L<Test::Dist::Zilla/"expected">) the routine checks
release fails with the expected exception. If exception is not expected the routine checks release
completes successfully.

=item *

If expected C<messages> are specified (see L<Test::Dist::Zilla/"expected">) the routine compares
(with C<cmd_deeply>) actual messages and expected messages.
