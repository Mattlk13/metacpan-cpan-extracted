VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Text::DiffU (from Perl
    distribution Text-DiffU), released on 2018-04-03.

FUNCTIONS
  diff_u
    Usage:

     diff_u(%args) -> any

    Diff two sequences and print unified-style output.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ctx => *uint* (default: 3)

    *   hook_format_diff_items => *code*

        Hook will be called with these arguments:

         (\@items1, \@items2)

        The default hook will print this, i.e. items1 as lines where each
        line is prefixed by a "-" (minus) sign, followed by items2 as lines
        where each line is prefixed by a "+" (plus) sign:

          -line1_from_items1
          -line2_from_items1
          ...
          +line1_from_items2
          +line2_from_items2
          ...

    *   hook_format_hunk_header => *code*

        Hook will be called with these arguments:

         ($line1_start, $line2_start, $num_lines1, $num_lines2)

        The default hook will print this:

         @@ -<line1_start>,<num_lines1> +<line2_start>,<num_lines2> @@

    *   hook_format_same_items => *code*

        Hook will be called with these arguments:

         (\@items)

        The default hook will print this (i.e. items as lines where each
        line is prefixed by a single space):

          line1
          line2
          ...

    *   hook_format_seq_header => *code*

        Hook will be called with these arguments:

         ($seq1_name, $seq2_name)

    *   seq1* => *array*

    *   seq1_name => *str* (default: "(seq1)")

    *   seq2* => *array*

    *   seq2_name => *str* (default: "(seq2)")

    *   use_color => *bool*

        Whether the default hooks should print ANSI color escape sequences.

        The default is to use setting from "COLOR" environment variable, or
        check if program is run interactively.

    Return value: (any)
