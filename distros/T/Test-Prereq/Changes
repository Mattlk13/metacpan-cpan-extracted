Revision history for Perl module Test::Prereq

2.003 2019-12-20T06:43:31Z
	* Uniq the list of modules this extracts. Module::Extract::Use 1.045
	changed slightly to return a bit more than it used to.

	* Support test_requires in Module::Build (Sam Brightman, GitHub #15)

2.001_002 2016-10-28T00:42:22Z
	* Fix postderef. I specified v5.22, but it was still experimental then.
	Identified by Slaven ReziÄ (https://github.com/briandfoy/test-prereq/issues/14)

2.001_001 2016-10-24T04:12:51Z
	* Big changes:
	+ No more filtering out core modules (some things are ejected from core!)
	+ Switched from Module::Info to Module::Extract::Use
	+ Switched from old Test::Builder to Test::Builder::Module from the
	new Test::Simple stuff.

1.38_01 - 2014-01-03
	* Handle TEST_REQUIRES
	* Fixes for v5.8, which doesn't include Module::Build

1.38 - 2014-01-02
	* Use Makefile.PL instead of Build.PL since Module::Build
	is likely to be deprecated
	* Fix up Pod encoding issues

1.037 - 2009-06-01
	* Fix #46335: qualify calls to find() so Module::Install
	doesn't intercept them.

1.035 - 2008-08-02
	* Cleaning up the Makefile a bit. No need to upgrade.

1.034 - 2008-07-12
	* Various minor cleanups. No big whoop.

1.033 - 2007-03-16
	* Fixed load test to not complain when trying to import the same
	symbol twice
	* No code fixes otherwise. No need to upgrade.

1.032 - 2007-01-09
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.031 - 2006-05-17
	* updates to distro and kwalitee. No need to upgrade

1.030 - 2006-05-17
	* Updates to distro and kwalitee. No need to upgrade.

1.030 - 2006-01-11
	* Tests should now work even if there is nothing in PREREQ_PM. In the
	previous version, an empty PREREQ_PM made the module think Makefile.PL
	didn't exit cleanly.
	* Everyone should upgrade.

1.029 - 2005-12-25
	* Updated some tests that had some problems. No need to upgrade.

1.028 - 2005-07-13
	* Simple doc fixes. No need to upgrade.

1.027 - 2005-03-08
	* fixed up the bits that deal with the plan, to make things
	consistent. prereq_ok will create the plan if it doesn't
	exist, or leave it alone if it does.
	* You don't need to use Test::More (and you didn't need
	to previously, despite the docs)

1.026 - 2005-03-04
	* Documentation fix for command line invocation: Test::Prereq
	calls plan() for you, so you don't have to.
