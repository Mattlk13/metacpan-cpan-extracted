=head1 NAME

Test2::Harness::Parser - Default parser, parser-dispatcher, and parser base
class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parser is responsible for consuming lines of output from the running test,
and turning the output into L<Test2::Event> objects.

This is the default parser. This parser inspects the output stream from the
unit test and looks for the correct parser to handle it. If the output contains
a line like C<T2_FORMATTER: Foo> then this will look for
C<Test2::Harness::Parser::FOO>. If the output looks like a TAP stream then
L<Test2::Harness::Parser::TAP> will be selected.

In general a test using Test2 tools will use
L<Test2::Harness::Parser::EventStream>. However any test that loads
L<Test::Builder> directly or indirectly will use L<Test2::Harness::Parser::TAP>
as a precaution.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $proc = $p->proc()

This returns the L<Test2::Harness::Proc> object, which is a handle for the
running test. Use this to get lines of output, or to control the child process. 

=item $j = $p->job()

This will be an integer. This is the job number assigned to the test being
parsed.

=item $p->morph()

When the parser decides a different parser is the correct one to use, it will
re-bless itself to the new parser class and call this method. This method is
your chance to make any additional changes to the parser object.

=item @events = $p->step()

This is called regularly by the harness. This should consume any lines of
output that are available and return the L<Test2::Event> objects
produced. If there was no output to consume this should return an empty list.
This should never block as it is called in an event loop.

The default version of this method will read lines of STDERR/STDOUT and attempt
to find the correct subclass to use. Any lines output that do not help identify
the parser are turned into simple noise/diagnostics L<Test2::Event>
objects.

If the parser is identified from the output stream the parser object will
re-bless itself and call C<morph()>.
