 * Have runner spawn the test
 * Have main process monitor for jobs to start/end

  * New job:
   * spawn processor with pipe (collect and audit, one process)
   * Update running status display

  * Job End:
   * Update running status display (but note that it is processing still if processor is not done)

The main process will read all the ongoing pipes and render the output, it will also launch processors as needed.

Do we want an option to produce job-logs with -k instead of using pipes?


if (defined &Fcntl::F_SETPIPE_SZ) {
    # Set pipe buffer to 5mb
    my $size = fcntl($out_wh, Fcntl::F_SETPIPE_SZ, (5 * 1024 * 1014));
}
