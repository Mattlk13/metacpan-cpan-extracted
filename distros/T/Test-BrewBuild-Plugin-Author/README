NAME

    Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::Author - Default test run, but installs author
    test distributions

SYNOPSIS

        # install various POD and MANIFEST testing distributions, then
        # run the default tests
    
        brewbuild --plugin Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::Author

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution/module is exactly the same as the default test
    execution plugin that is distributed with Test::BrewBuild, which is
    Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::DefaultExec. The only difference is this one
    will install author-related distributions that will perform the tests
    typically run when under the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING=1.

    These installed distributions are:

        Pod::Coverage
        Test::Pod::Coverage
        Test::Manifest

    We also attempt to set $ENV{RELEASE} =1. If we can't, and a log object
    is sent in, we'll log that the environment variable isn't set so author
    testing can't be performed.

METHODS

 brewbuild_exec($log)

    Is called by Test::BrewBuild::exec(), executes the test commands
    provided by this plugin's DATA section.

    Optionally takes a Test::BrewBuild::log() object as a parameter.
