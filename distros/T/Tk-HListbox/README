Tk::HMListbox Module 1.00

Tk::HListbox is a derivitive of Tk::HList and Tk::Listbox that adds the 
ability to include images, as well as text, as supported by the 
underlying HList widget.  The main physical difference between 
Tk::HListbox and Tk::Listbox is that it is derived from HList.  However, 
the purpose of this widget is to provide a drop-in Tk::HList-based 
replacement for Tk::Listbox, hence the interface is designed to match 
that of Tk::Listbox while providing most of the features of Tk::HList.

Tk::HListbox supports almost all the options provided by Tk::Listbox.  
Currently "bbox()", "Motion()", "-listvariable" and "-activestyle".  
You'll need to comment out or remove these if switching from Tk::Listbox 
to Tk::HListbox.

Tk::HListbox lets the user create Listboxes with images (icons) either 
in lieu of or along with text strings as selectable options.  One can 
also mix options containing text, images, or both in the same listbox.

Tk::HListbox is scrollable and supports the Scrolled() method.

I created Tk::HListbox in order to create Tk::HMListbox (a replacement 
for Tk::SMListbox and Tk::MListbox) in order to add a column of tiny 
icons in my "jfm4" file manager application.  I also felt that such a 
widget would be useful to others, seeing that nothing other than 
Tk::HList currently exists for creating a list of selectable images, 
but which could be used in an existing application that uses Tk::Listbox.

test.pl is a very simple file browser for unix/windows.
