Revision history for Perl extension Tk::HListbox.

1.00  Mon May 25, 2015
	- original version; Derived from Tk::HList and Tk::Listbox, 
	  created by h2xs 1.23 with options -X -n Tk::HListbox
2.00
	- Massive cleanup of bindings to make work more exactly like Tk::Listbox.
	  Added Tk::Listbox's -listvariable option and bbox() function.
	  This is implemented using the existing TIE @array feature.
	  Tk::HListbox previously used Tk::HList's "anchor" as it's "active" 
	  indicator since Tk::HList does not have the concept of an "active" 
	  entry, but now we use a hidden "virtual anchor" variable allowing 
	  us to maintain a proper select anchor while still using Tk::HList's 
	  anchor as the "active" cursor.
	  Added Tk::HList's hide() and show() functions and -command callback.
	  Added an image-only option (-itemtype => 'image').
	  Found and fixed numerous little issues and descrepencies.
	  It should now be possible to use Tk::HListbox as a complete drop-
	  in replacement for Tk::Listbox in existing code while simply adding 
	  any additional Tk::HListbox features, such as images, indicators, 
	  and callbacks as needed.
