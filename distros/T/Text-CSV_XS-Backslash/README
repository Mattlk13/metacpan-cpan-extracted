NAME
    Text::CSV_XS::Backslash - Set Text::CSV_XS default options to use
    backslash as escape character

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Text::CSV_XS::Backslash (from
    Perl distribution Text-CSV_XS-Backslash), released on 2022-02-18.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use Text::CSV_XS with the object interface:

     use Text::CSV_XS::TSV;
     my $csv = Text::CSV_XS::TSV->new({binary=>1});
     # ...

DESCRIPTION
    This class is a simple subclass of Text::CSV_XS to set the default of
    these options (if unspecified):

    *   sep_char

        To ',' (comma), which is already the default of Text::CSV_XS.

    *   quote_char

        To '"' (double-quote), which is already the default of Text::CSV_XS.

    *   escape_char

        To "\\" (backslash). Text::CSV_XS's default is double-doublequote
        ('""').

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
