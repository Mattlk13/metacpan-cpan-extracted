Try::Tiny::Tiny

The reason this module exists is that Try::Tiny will try naming the
blocks it is passed, if it can load a module for doing so. This takes
meaningful time, is only useful in stack traces, and then may defeat
code that tries to examine the stack to print a more helpful error
message.

Now, you yourself can avoid using Try::Tiny in the first place, but you
will almost inevitably still pull it in through your dependency chain,
and it is not likely to be feasible to scrub it out.

This module helps sanitise your dependency chain a bit without patching
all of it by loading Try::Tiny in such a way that it is forced to skip
naming its callbacks. In order to be useful, you must use this module
before using any other module that loads Try::Tiny. In practice that
means you probably want to load it as early as possible, such as through
PERL5OPT.
