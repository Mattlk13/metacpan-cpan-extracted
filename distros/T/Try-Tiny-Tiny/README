Try::Tiny::Tiny

This module slims down Try::Tiny as much as possible, currently by
preventing Try::Tiny from giving somewhat more human-friendly names to
the code references it is passed.

This is done by blocking Try::Tiny from finding any of the utility
modules it needs for this feature. As a result, you must use this module
before using any other module that loads Try::Tiny. In practice that
means you probably want to load it as early as possible, such as through
PERL5OPT.
