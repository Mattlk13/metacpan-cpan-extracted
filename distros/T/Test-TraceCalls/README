NAME
    Test::TraceCalls - which subs were called by which test scripts?

SYNOPSIS
    In every module of your project:

            use Test::TraceCalls;

    When you run your test suite:

            PERL_TRACE_CALLS=1 prove -lr t

    For every file "t/foo.t" in your test suite, Test::TraceCalls will
    generate "t/foo.t.map" containing a JSON summary of which subs got called
    by that test file.

DESCRIPTION
    Test::TraceCalls will trace calls to:

    *   Subs defined the normal way `sub name { ... }`

    *   Subs which have been imported, unless you unimport them later with
        namespace::autoclean or similar.

    *   Subs generated by Moose/Moo/Mouse `has`.

    Test::TraceCalls will NOT trace calls to:

    *   Inherited subs, unless the package you inherit from also uses
        Test::TraceCalls.

    *   Subs defined too late. (Including `new` generated by Moo sometimes.)

    *   Subs with names starting with an underscore, but see below.

    *   Subs with names not including a lower-case letter, because it's
        assumed these are just constants, but see below.

    The sub name filtering can be controlled by passing a `match` coderef at
    import time. The default `match` coderef is just:

            use Test::TraceCalls match => sub {
                    local $_ = shift;
                    !/^_/ and /\p{Ll}/;
            };
