NAME
    Task::LMDB - Stub module to depend on Alien::LMDB and LMDB_File

SYNOPSIS
    In your module's "Makefile.PL", depend on Task::LMDB instead of
    LMDB_File:

        PREREQ_PM => {
            'Task::LMDB' => 0,  ## provides LMDB_File
        },

    Same goes for "Build.PL":

        requires => {
            'Task::LMDB' => 0,  ## provides LMDB_File
        },

DESCRIPTION
    Since LMDB_File stopped bundling the LMDB
    <https://symas.com/products/lightning-memory-mapped-database/> source
    code, you must provide your own copy of "liblmdb.so" and its header
    files. Keeping them de-coupled allows the development of LMDB_File to
    not be tied to LMDB releases.

    Because LMDB_File needs to compile and link against LMDB, you must
    provide a working LMDB installation prior to installing LMDB_File. This
    can be accomplished by compiling LMDB from source code, using your
    operating system's package manager, or by installing the Alien::LMDB
    package. Alien::LMDB will attempt to use a system LMDB if it is
    installed, otherwise will compile its own bundled copy.

    Task::LMDB is just a stub module that depends on Alien::LMDB as a
    configure time dependency, and on LMDB_File as a regular dependency.
    This ordering ensures that Alien::LMDB will be installed prior to
    compiling LMDB_File. In this way, CPAN modules that don't care where the
    LMDB library comes from can depend on LMDB_File purely by adding a CPAN
    dependency on Task::LMDB.
