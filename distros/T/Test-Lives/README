Test::Lives

This module provides only one function, "lives_and", which works almost
exactly like the function of the same name in Test::Exception. That is,
it allows you to test things that could (but shouldn't) throw an
exception without having to have two separate tests with two separate
results (and two separate descriptions).

You pass it a block of code to run (which should contain one test
assertion) and a test description to give the assertion inside the
block.

The description will be available inside the block in the $_ variable.
(This is different from Test::Exception, which employs hacky magic to
relieve you of having to pass the description to the decorated
assertion.)

If the block ends up throwing an exception, a test failure will be
logged.
