NAME
    Text::Table::Org - Generate Org tables

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.030 of Text::Table::Org (from Perl
    distribution Text-Table-Org), released on 2022-01-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Table::Org;

     my $rows = [
         # header row
         ['Name', 'Rank', 'Serial'],
         # rows
         ['alice', 'pvt', '123456'],
         ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],
         ['carol', 'brig gen', '8745'],
     ];
     print Text::Table::Org::table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single function, "table", which formats a
    two-dimensional array of data as an Org text table.

    The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

     | Name  | Rank     | Serial   |
     |-------+----------+----------|
     | alice | pvt      | 123456   |
     | bob   | cpl      | 98765321 |
     | carol | brig gen | 8745     |

FUNCTIONS
  table(%params) => str
  OPTIONS
    The "table" function understands these arguments, which are passed as a
    hash.

    *   rows (aoaos)

        Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
        data, where each row is an array reference.

    *   header_row (bool)

        If given a true value, the first row in the data will be interpreted
        as a header row, and separated from the rest of the table with a
        ruled line.

    *   separate_rows (bool)

        If set to true, will add separator line between data rows.

SEE ALSO
    This module is currently basically Text::Table::Tiny 0.03 modified to
    output Org tables instead of its original variant table format.

    The output of this module is very similar to that of
    Text::MarkdownTable. In fact, Org recognizes its output as a valid Org
    table (the only difference is that corner marker is "|" instead of the
    Org standard of "+").

    Some other text table modules: Text::ANSITable, Text::ASCIITable,
    Text::FormatTable, Text::Table, Text::TabularDisplay.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
