NAME

    Test::PAUSE::ConsistentPermissions

VERSION

    version 0.003

DESCRIPTION

    This module is designed to check the permissions of this distribution
    and ensure that they are consistent. This checks that for all the
    modules in the distribution the owner and comaintainer are the same.

    To perform your own checks in some way other than a simple test look at
    the Test::PAUSE::ConsistentPermissions::Check module.

    Note that this is different to checking that the current author has
    permission to upload this module.

        use Test::More;
        use Test::PAUSE::ConsistentPermissions;
    
        all_permissions_consistent 'Test::PAUSE::ConsistentPermissions';
    
        done_testing;

    These test will only run if the RELEASE_TESTING environment variable is
    set, otherwise they will skip.

    Note that missing permissions will not cause a test failure, but if you
    are in verbose mode a note will be made. This is because when you're
    doing a release including new files those permissions will indeed not
    be found.

    The success message will be subtly different when the permissions don't
    exist for some of the modules you are about to upload.

    For a script to check modules on CPAN see pause-check-distro-perms.
