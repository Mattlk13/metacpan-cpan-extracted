NAME

    Task::AlienDev - Task bundle for Alien development

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     $ cpanm Task::AlienDev

DESCRIPTION

    This Task bundle is useful for those doing Alien development.
    Installing it will give you these modules:

    Alien::Build

      Framework for writing Aliens.

    Alien::MSYS

      Is used on Windows to make autoconf style packages work.

    App::af

      The af command line application for working with alienfiles.

    Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::AlienBuild

      The Dist::Zilla minting profile for creating Alien::Build based
      Aliens.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AlienBuild

      Some useful Dist::Zilla plugins useful for developing Alien::Build
      based Aliens.

    The latest versions as of when this Task was released should be
    installed at minimum if they are not already installed.

    Other prereqs may be added in the future if they are deemed useful for
    Alien development.

CAVEATS

    This module does require Perl 5.22 or better currently because at least
    some of its prereqs require that version. Note that Aliens authored
    with these tools should work on Perls of at least 5.8.4 or better, so
    this is just a development requirement.

    This Task indirectly requires both Alien::FFI and Alien::Libarchive3.
    If you do not want to build them from source or do not have internet
    access where the build is happening you will want to pre-install libffi
    and libarchive. On Debian based systems you can do that with sudo
    apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libarchive-dev.
