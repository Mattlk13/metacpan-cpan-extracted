NAME
    Type::Library::Compiler - compile a bunch of type constraints into a
    library with no non-core dependencies

SYNOPSIS
      type-library-compiler --module=MyApp::Types Types::Standard=-all

DESCRIPTION
    This class performs the bulk of the work for type-library-compiler.

  Constructor
   `new( %attributes )`
  Attributes
   `types` Map[ NonEmptyStr => Object ]
    Required hash of Type::Tiny objects. Hash keys are the names the types
    will have in the generated library.

   `pod` Bool
    Should the generated module include pod? Defaults to true.

   `destination_module` NonEmptyStr
    Required Perl module name to produce.

   `constraint_module` NonEmptyStr
    Leave this as the default.

   `destination_filename` NonEmptyStr
    Leave this as the default.

  Object Methods
   `compile_to_file()`
    Writes the module to `destination_filename`.

   `compile_to_string()`
    Returns the module as a string of Perl code.

  Class Methods
   `parse_list( @argv )`
    Parses a list of strings used to specify type constraints on the command
    line, and returns a hashref of Type::Tiny objects, suitable for the
    `types` attribute.
