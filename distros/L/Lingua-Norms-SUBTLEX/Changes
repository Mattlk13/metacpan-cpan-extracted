Revision history for Lingua-Norms-SUBTLEX-0.06

0.07    2018.06.08
        - resolves issue in set_lang() method for finding the specs.csv file during pre-install testing - thanks to Slaven Rezic for pointing this out

0.06    2018.03.27
        - case- and mark-sensitivity control introduced: Following what is used in the Perl module "Text::Levenshtein". By a "matching level" set in new() and via "set_eq()" method. The default remains to search case (and mark) insensitively.
        - pos_all method added
        - pos_ methods have added argument 'conform' to transliterate the file-given strings into common code.
        - set_lang() and get_lang() methods introduced to query the datafile being used and to change it.
        - frq_count, frq_opm, cd_count and cd_pct now return 0 rather than empty-string if the looked-up string was not found in the language file.
        - all_strings now culls duplicates with uniq() after firstly ensuring have a non-empty string; given some empty lines and duplicate strings for different POS in some files; and then alphabetically sorts them.
        - method "list_strings" renamed "select_strings" to avoid confusion with "all_strings", which also returns a list of strings.
        - select_strings checks that value is defined for a language file, and that if retrieved it is numeric ahead of checking its range--in case the field is empty for a file (as seems to happen for cd_count with UK file).
        - cv_pattern regex check in select_strings transliterates tested strings to ASCII to capture, say, 'é' in the string with just 'e' in the pattern.
        - frq_sum method added and POD for related methods indicate that they all can be used to obtain descriptives of frq_count as well.
        - POD documentation for stats methods corrected: "raw" should have been "opm", and there is no argument named "log".
        - added a croak if "The requested value is not defined for the SUBTLEX-x corpus" of a particular language x.
        - Dependency on File::Slurp removed in place of Path::Tiny.
        - croak messages expanded to include statement of the method called.
        - NL lang: need to specify _all or _min files; see table in POD

0.05    2015.02.28
        - Added support for German SUBTLEX (language DE), in addition to NL, UK and US files.

0.04    2015.02.27
        - Added support for UK and NL

0.03    2015.01.11
        - Misc. code and doc clean-ups, including corrected version numbering and internal linking.

0.02    2015.01.10
        - Added methods to directly retrieve the "contextual diversity" measures as percentage, and log of percentage.
        - Corrected the calculation of mean Levenshtein Distance by the function on_ldist - it should not previously have been a public method. Two pre-installation tests, based on the example data in the Yarkoni et al. (2008) paper, have been added, ensuring that the method returns the correct values.
        - Revised POD documentation, including doi links.

0.01    2014.08.08
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
