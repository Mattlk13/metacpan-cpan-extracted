    variables

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger;
     use Log::ger::Level::FromEnv;

     log_warn "blah ...";

DESCRIPTION
    This module sets $Log::ger::Current_Level based on hints from several
    environment variables: "LOG_LEVEL" (for example, if set to "warn" or
    "warning" will set the log level to warning (30)), "TRACE" (if true,
    will set log level to trace (60)), "DEBUG" (if true, will set log level
    to debug (50)), "VERBOSE" (if true, will set log level to info (40)),
    "QUIET" (if true, will set log level to error (20)).

    This is convenient for CLI programs.
