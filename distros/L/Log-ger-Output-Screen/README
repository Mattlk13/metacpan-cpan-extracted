         # use_color   => 0,    # set to 1/0 to force usage of color, default is from NO_COLOR/COLOR or (-t STDOUT)
         # color_depth => 16,   # if unset will guess from heuristic
         # formatter   => sub { ... },

DESCRIPTION
CONFIGURATION
  stderr
    Bool, default 1. Whether to print to STDERR (the default) or STDOUT.

  use_color
    Bool. The default is to look at the NO_COLOR and COLOR environment
    variables, or 1 when in interactive mode and 0 when not in interactive
    mode.

  color_depth
    Integer, either 0, 16, 256, or 16777216. If unset, will use the
    following heuristic to guess color depth of terminal. First, if
    "use_color" is false then 0. Otherwise, check if COLORTERM environment
    variable is defined and has the value of "truecolor"; if yes then use
    16777216. Otherwise, check if TERM environment variable contains the
    string "256color"; if yes then 256. Otherwise 16.

  formatter
    Coderef. When defined, will pass the formatted message (but being
    applied with colors) to this custom formatter.

ENVIRONMENT
  NO_COLOR
    Can be set (to anything) to disable color by default, if "/use_color" is
    not set. Consulted before "COLOR".

  COLOR
    Can be set to disable/enable color by default, if "/use_color" is not
    set.
