     $res = is_monovalued(qw/a a a/); # => 1
     $res = is_monovalued(qw/a b a/); # => 0

     $res = is_monovalued_ci(qw/a a A/); # => 1
     $res = is_monovalued_ci(qw/a b A/); # => 0

     $res = is_uniq(qw/a b a/); # => 0
     $res = is_uniq(qw/a b c/); # => 1

     $res = is_uniq_ci(qw/a b A/); # => 0
     $res = is_uniq_ci(qw/a b c/); # => 1

     @res = uniq_adj(1, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2); # => (1, 4, 3, 1, 2)

     @res = uniq_adj_ci("a", "b", "B", "c", "a"); # => ("a", "b", "c", "a")

     @res = uniq_ci("a", "b", "B", "c", "a"); #  => ("a", "b", "c")

     @res = dupe("a","b","a","a","b","c"); #  => ("a","a","b")
     @res = dupeint(1,1.2,1.3,2); #  => (1.2,1.3)
     @res = dupenum(1,2,1,1,2,3); #  => (1,1,2)
     @res = dupenum("a",0,0.0,1); #  => (0,0.0), because "a" becomes 0 numerically
     @res = dupestr("a","b","a","a","b","c"); # => ("a","a","b")

     @res = dupe_ci("a", "b", "B", "c", "a"); #  => ("B", "a")

DESCRIPTION
    This module supplements List::Util with functions related to list item's
    uniqueness.

FUNCTIONS
    None exported by default but exportable.

  uniq_adj
    Usage:

     my @uniq = uniq_adj(@list);

    Remove *adjacent* duplicates from list, i.e. behave more like Unix
    utility's uniq instead of List::Util's "uniq" function. Uses string
    equality test (the "eq" operator).

  uniq_adj_ci
    Like "uniq_adj" except case-insensitive.

  uniq_ci
    Like "List::Util"' "uniq" ("uniqstr") except case-insensitive.

  is_uniq
    Usage:

     my $is_uniq = is_uniq(@list);

    Return true when the values in @list is unique (compared string-wise).
    In theory, knowing whether a list has unique values is faster using this
    function compared to doing:

     my @uniq = uniq(@list);
     @uniq == @list;

    because of short-circuiting.

  is_uniq_ci
    Like "is_uniq" except case-insensitive.

  is_monovalued
    Usage:

     my $is_monovalued = is_monovalued(@list);

    Examples:

     is_monovalued(qw/a b c/); # => 0
     is_monovalued(qw/a a a/); # => 1

    Return true if @list contains only a single value. Returns true for
    empty list. Undef is coerced to empty string, so is_monovalued(undef)
    and "is_monovalued(undef, undef)" return true.

  is_monovalued_ci
    Like "is_monovalued" except case-insensitive.

  dupe
    See "dupestr".

  dupeint
    Like "dupestr" but the values are compared as integers. If you only want
    to list each duplicate elements once, you can do:

     @uniq_dupes = uniqint(dupeint(@list));

    where "uniqint" can be found in List::Util, but the pure-perl version is
    also provided by this module, for convenience.

  dupenum
    Like "dupestr" but the values are compared numerically. If you only want
    to list each duplicate elements once, you can do:

     @uniq_dupes = uniqnum(dupenum(@list));

    where "uniqnum" can be found in List::Util, but the pure-perl version is
    also provided by this module, for convenience.

  dupestr
    Usage:

     @dupes = dupestr(@list);

    Return duplicate elements (the second and subsequence occurrences of
    each element) in @list. If you only want to list each duplicate elements
    once, you can do:

     @uniq_dupes = uniqstr(dupestr(@list));

    where "uniqstr" can be found in List::Util, but the pure-perl version is
    also provided by this module, for convenience.

  dupe_ci
    Like "dupe" except case-insensitive.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
