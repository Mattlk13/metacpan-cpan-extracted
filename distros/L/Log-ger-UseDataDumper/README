NAME
    Log::ger::UseDataDumper - Use Data::Dumper (with nicer defaults) to dump
    data structures

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Log::ger::UseDataDumper (from
    Perl distribution Log-ger-UseDataDumper), released on 2019-05-08.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::UseDataDumper;

    To configure Data::Dumper:

     use Log::ger::UseDataDumper (Indent => 0, Purity => 0);

DESCRIPTION
    This module sets the Log::ger dumper to Data::Dumper, which by default
    is already the case but in this edition the default configuration is
    somewhat closer to that of Data::Dump:

     Indent => 1,
     Purity => 1,
     Terse  => 1,
     Useqq  => 1,

    This module also lets you configure Data::Dumper during import (see
    example in Synopsis).
