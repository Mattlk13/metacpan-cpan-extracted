NAME
    List::Util::sglice - Remove some elements where code returns true

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of List::Util::sglice (from Perl
    distribution List-Util-sglice), released on 2023-09-18.

SYNOPSIS
     use List::Util::sglice qw(sglice);

     my @ary = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);

     # 1. remove all even numbers (equivalent to: @ary = grep { !($_ % 2 == 0) } @ary

     #                       --------------------------- 1st param: code to match elements to remove
     #                      /     ---------------------- 2nd param: the array
     #                     /     /  -------------------- 3rd param: (optional) how many matching elems to remove, undef means all, negative allowed to mean last N matching elems
     #                    /     /  /
     sglice { $_ % 2 == 0 } @ary    ;  # => (1,3,5,7,9)

     # 3. remove first two even numbers
     sglice { $_ % 2 == 0 } @ary,  2;  # => (1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10)

     # 4. remove last two even numbers
     sglice { $_ % 2 == 0 } @ary, -2;  # => (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9)

     # 5. remove elements #0..#2, equivalent to: splice @ary, 0, 2
     sglice { $_[1] <= 2  } @ary;      # => (4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

     # 6. put even numbers to the beginning of array
     unshift @ary, sglice { $_ % 2 == 0 } @ary;  # => (2,4,6,8,10,  1,3,5,7,9)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides "sglice".

FUNCTIONS
    Not exported by default but exportable.

  sglice
    Usage:

     sglice CODE ARRAY, NUM_TO_REMOVE
     sglice CODE ARRAY

    "sglice" (mnemonic: "g" is for *grep*) somewhat resembles "splice".
    Instead of specifying offset and number of elements to remove from
    "ARRAY", you specify "CODE" to match elements to remove. Unlike
    "splice", "sglice" does not let you reinsert new items (see
    List::Util::msplice for that).

    In CODE, $_ (as well as $_[0]) is set to array element. $_[1] is set to
    the index of the element, so you can still remove elements by their
    position.

    The third parameter, "NUM_TO_REMOVE", is the number of elements to
    remove. If unspecified, all matching elements will be removed. You can
    also specify negative integer to remove NUM last matching elements.
    Setting this to 0 effectively means a no-op.

    In list context, the function returns the removed elements. In scalar
    context, it returns the last removed elements.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
