NAME
    List::Util::Find - List utilities related to finding items

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of List::Util::Find (from Perl
    distribution List-Util-Find), released on 2023-09-16.

SYNOPSIS
     use List::Util::Find qw(hasnum hasstr);

     my @ary = (1,3,"foo",7,2,"bar",10,"baz");

     if (hasnum 3, @ary) {
         ...
     }

     if (hasstr "baz", @ary) {
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Experimental.

FUNCTIONS
    Not exported by default but exportable.

  hasnum
    Usage:

     hasnum $num, ...

    Like "grep { $_ == $num } ..." except: 1) it short-circuits (exits early
    as soon as an item is found); 2) it makes sure "undef" does not match;
    3) it makes sure non-numeric scalars don't match when $num is zero. It
    is equivalent to something like:

     use List::Util qw(first);
     use Scalar::Util qw(looks_like_number);
     defined(first { defined && looks_like_number($_) && $_ == $num } @list);

    except it does not use any module.

  hasstr
    Usage:

     hasstr $str, ...

    Like "grep { $_ eq $num } ..." except: 1) it short-circuits (exits early
    as soon as an item is found); 2) it makes sure "undef" does not match
    empty string. It is equivalent to something like:

     use List::Util qw(first);
     defined(first { defined && $_ eq $str } @list);

    except it does not use any module.

FAQ
  How about hasundef, hasref, hasarrayref, ...?
    They are trivial enough:

     first { !defined } @list;
     first { ref $_ } @list;
     first { ref $_ eq 'ARRAY' } @list;
     # and so on

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
