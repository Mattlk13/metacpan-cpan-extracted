VERSION

    distribution List-Util-Find), released on 2021-06-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use List::Util::Find qw(hasnum hasstr);

     my @ary = (1,3,"foo",7,2,"bar",10,"baz");

     if (hasnum 3, @ary) {

DESCRIPTION
    Experimental.

FUNCTIONS
    Not exported by default but exportable.

  hasnum
    Usage:

     hasnum $num, ...

    Like "grep { $_ == $num } ..." except: 1) it short-circuits (exits early
    as soon as an item is found); 2) it makes sure "undef" does not match;
    3) it makes sure non-numeric scalars don't match when $num is zero.

  hasstr
    Usage:

     hasstr $str, ...

    Like "grep { $_ eq $num } ..." except: 1) it short-circuits (exits early
    as soon as an item is found); 2) it makes sure "undef" does not match
    empty string.
