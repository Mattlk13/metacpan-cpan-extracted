VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of LWP::UserAgent::Plugin::Cache
    (from Perl distribution LWP-UserAgent-Plugin-Cache), released on
    2019-04-15.

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::Plugin 'Cache' => {
         max_age  => '3600',     # defaults to LWP_USERAGENT_PLUGIN_CACHE_MAX_AGE or CACHE_MAX_AGE or 86400
         cache_if => qr/^[23]/,  # optional, default is to cache all responses
     };

     my $res2 = LWP::UserAgent::Plugin->request(GET => "http://www.example.com/"); # cached response

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin can cache responses to cache files.

    Currently only GET requests are cached. Cache are keyed by
    SHA256-hex(URL). Error responses are also cached (unless you configure
    "/cache_if"). Currently no cache-related HTTP request or response
    headers (e.g. "Cache-Control") are respected.

CONFIGURATION
  max_age
    Int.

  cache_if
    Regex or code. If regex, then will be matched against response status.
    If code, will be called with arguments: "($self, $response)".

ENVIRONMENT
  CACHE_MAX_AGE
    Int. Will be consulted after "LWP_USERAGENT_PLUGIN_CACHE_MAX_AGE".

  LWP_USERAGENT_PLUGIN_CACHE_MAX_AGE
    Int. Will be consulted before "CACHE_MAX_AGE".
