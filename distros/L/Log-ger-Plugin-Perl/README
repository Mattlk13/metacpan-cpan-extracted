NAME
    Log::ger::Plugin::Perl - Replace log statements with Perl's standard
    facility (warn, die, etc)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Log::ger::Plugin::Perl (from
    Perl distribution Log-ger-Plugin-Perl), released on 2020-03-11.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Plugin Perl => (
         action => { # optional
             trace => '',
             debug => '',
             info  => '',
             warn  => 'warn',
             error => 'warn',
             fatal => 'die',
         },
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin uses B::CallChecker to replace logging statements with
    "warn()", "die()", etc.

    Caveats:

    *   must be done at compile-time

    *   only works when you are using procedural style

    *   logging statements at level with action='' or unmentioned, will
        become no-op

        The effect is similar to what is achieved by

    *   once replaced/optimized away, subsequent logger reinitialization at
        run-time won't take effect

    *   currently formats message with sprintf(), no layouter support

CONFIGURATION
  action => hash
    A mapping of Log::ger error level name and action. Unmentioned levels
    mean to ignore log for that level. Action can be one of:

    *   '' (empty string)

        Ignore the log message.

    *   warn

        Pass message to Perl's "warn()".

    *   die

        Pass message to Perl's "die()".

    *   carp

        Pass message to Carp's "carp()".

    *   cluck

        Pass message to Carp's "cluck()".

    *   croak

        Pass message to Carp's "croak()".

    *   confess

        Pass message to Carp's "confess()".
