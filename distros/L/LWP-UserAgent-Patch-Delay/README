    LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Delay - Add sleep() between requests to slow down

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Delay
    (from Perl distribution LWP-UserAgent-Patch-Delay), released on
    2019-04-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Delay;

DESCRIPTION
    This patch adds sleep() between LWP::UserAgent's requests.

CONFIGURATION
  -between_request
    Float. Default is 1. Number of seconds to sleep() after each request.
    Uses Time::HiRes so you can include fractions of a second, e.g. 0.1 or
    1.5.

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP::UserAgent (or WWW::Mechanize, and so on).
