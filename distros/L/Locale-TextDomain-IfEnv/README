NAME
    Locale::TextDomain::IfEnv - Enable translation only when environment
    variable flag is true

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Locale::TextDomain::IfEnv (from
    Perl distribution Locale-TextDomain-IfEnv), released on 2019-12-26.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use Locale::TextDomain (but see "Caveats"):

     use Locale::TextDomain::IfEnv 'Some-TextDomain';

     print __ "Hello, world!\n";

DESCRIPTION
    When imported, Locale::TextDomain::IfEnv will check the
    "PERL_LOCALE_TEXTDOMAIN_IFENV" environment variable. If the environment
    variable has a true value, the module will load Locale::TextDomain and
    pass the import arguments to it. If the environment variable is false,
    the module will install a mock version of "__", et al. Thus, all strings
    will translate to themselves.

    This module can be used to avoid the startup (and runtime) cost of
    translation unless when you want to enable translation.

  Caveats
    For simplicity, currently the tied hash (%__) and its hashref ($__) are
    not provided. Contact me if you use and need this.
