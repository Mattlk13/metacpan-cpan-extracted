DESCRIPTION

    This module provides two functions, words2nums and words2nums_simple.
    They are the counterpart of Lingua::ID::Nums2Words's nums2words and
    nums2words_simple.

EXPORTS

    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

 $Pat (regex)

    A regex for quickly matching/extracting number verbage from text; it
    looks for a string of words. It's not perfect (improper verbage might
    be allowed, e.g. "dua ribu tiga juta"), but it's convenient.

    Currently only multipliers up to trillions ("triliun") are recognized.
    Bigger multipliers are usually only found in scientific text.

SEE ALSO

    Lingua::ID::Nums2Words

    Parse::Number::ID is used to parse numbers in the verbage.
