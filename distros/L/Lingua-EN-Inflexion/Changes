    [All of the following are due to Lady Aleena (to whom, my sincere thanks)]
    * Added noun(...)->cardinal to convert numbers to words and vice-versa
    * Added noun(...)->ordinal to convert ordinals to words and vice-versa
    * Added 'w'   option to <#...> to inflect numbers as words
    * Added 'w99' option to <#...> to inflect numbers as words (above threshold)
    * Added 'o'   option to <#...> to inflect numbers as ordinals
    * Various documentation improvements
    * Added a documentation section describing equivalences with Lingua::EN::Inflect


0.001001  Sun May 28 13:04:53 2017

0.001005  Sun Oct  8 09:29:22 2017

    * Fixed 'expenses' -> 'expense', etc.
      (Thanks, Dorian)




0.001006  Sun Oct  8 17:38:17 2017

    * Fixed t/wordlist.t by removing 'no_plan'


0.001007  Sun May  6 06:09:51 2018

    * Extended verb->as_regex() to match preterite and both participles
      (Thanks, David)

    * Added $person parameter to singular() and plural() methods
      (Thanks, David)

    * Made singular() and plural() methods called with no argument act
      as expected wrt terms that are inflected for person. Specifically,
      these methods now do not change the form of a singular inflection.
      For example: verb('am')->singular used to return 'is', but now
      returns 'am'.

    * Improved robustness of "<preposition> <pronoun>" inflexions
