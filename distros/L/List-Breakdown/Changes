Revision history for Perl module List::Breakdown

Initial revision history up to 0.11 was a little overzealous with
releases until #perl told me to calm down. All of those versions are
documented here anyway for comprehensiveness' sake. Entries with "No
important changes" are likely to be trivial things like documentation
fixes or Perl::Tidy runs.
