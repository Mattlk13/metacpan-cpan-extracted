NAME
    Log::File::Rolling - Log to date/time-stamped files

SYNOPSIS
      use Log::File::Rolling;

      my $logger = Log::File::Rolling->new(
                       filename => 'myapp.%Y-%m-%d.log',
                       current_symlink => 'myapp.log.current',
                       timezone => 'localtime',
                   );

      $logger->log("My log message\n");

ABSTRACT
    This module provides an object for logging to files. The log file will
    be "rolled" over to the next file whenever the filename changes
    according to the "filename" format parameter. When this occurs, an
    optional "current_symlink" file will be pointed to the current file.

DESCRIPTION
    This module was forked from the Log::Dispatch::File::Rolling to add the
    symlink feature and fix a few other minor issues (see the "Changes" file
    for details).

    Similar to the original, this module should also have these properties:

    fork()-safe
        This module will close and re-open the logfile after a fork.

    multitasking-safe
        This module uses flock() to lock the file while writing to it.

    stamped filenames
        This module's "stamped" filenames are rendered with Time::Piece's
        "strftime" function. By default it uses "gmtime" for UTC timestamps,
        but this can be changed by passing "localtime" into the
        constructor's "timezone" parameter (see the synopsis).

        NOTE: Because of a caching optimisation, files should not be rotated
        more often than once per second.

    current symlinks
        If you pass in "current_symlink" to the constructor, it will create
        a symlink at your provided filename. This symlink will always link
        to the most recent log file. You can then use "tail -F" to monitor
        an application's logs with no interruptions even when the filename
        rolls over.

METHODS
    new()
        Constructs an object. An empty file will be created at this point.

    log()
        Takes a message as an argument which will be stringified and
        appended to the current file.
