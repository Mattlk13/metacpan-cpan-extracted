NAME
    List::Permute::Limit - Permute all items list, with limit of number of
    items per result item

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of List::Permute::Limit (from Perl
    distribution List-Permute-Limit), released on 2019-12-31.

SYNOPSIS
     use List::Permute::Limit qw(permute_iter permute);

     # iterator interface
     my $iter = permute_iter(items=>["zero","one","two","three"], nitems=>2);
     while (my $ary = $iter->()) {
         print "@{$ary}\n";
     }

    will print:

     zero zero
     zero one
     zero two
     zero three
     one zero
     one one
     one two
     one three
     two zero
     two one
     two two
     two three
     three zero
     three one
     three two
     three three

    To return the whole permutation in a list:

     # array interface
     my @res = permute(items=>["zero","one","two","three"], nitems=>2);
     # => (
     #   ["zero", "zero"],
     #   ["zero", "one"],
     #   ["zero", "two"],
     #   ["zero", "three"],
     #   ["one", "zero"],
     #   ["one", "one"],
     #   ["one", "two"],
     #   ["one", "three"],
     #   ["two", "zero"],
     #   ["two", "one"],
     #   ["two", "two"],
     #   ["two", "three"],
     #   ["three", "zero"],
     #   ["three", "one"],
     #   ["three", "two"],
     #   ["three", "three"],
     # )

    This is just yet another list permutor module, with a limit on the
    number of items per result.
