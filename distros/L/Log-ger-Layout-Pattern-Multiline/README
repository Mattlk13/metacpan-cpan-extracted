NAME
    Log::ger::Layout::Pattern::Multiline - Pattern layout (with multiline
    message split)

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Layout 'Pattern::Multiline', format => '%d (%F:%L)> %m';
     use Log::ger;

DESCRIPTION
    This is just like Log::ger::Layout::Pattern except that multiline log
    message is split per-line so that a message like "line1\nline2\nline3"
    (with "[%r] %m" format) is not laid out as:

     [0.003] line1
     line2
     line3

    but as:

     [0.003] line1
     [0.003] line2
     [0.003] line3
