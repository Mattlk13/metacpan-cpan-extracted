NAME
    Log::ger::Format::Default - Use default Log::ger formatting style

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Format 'Default';
     use Log::ger;

     log_debug "Printed as is";
     # will format the log message as: Printed as is

     log_debug "Data for %s is %s", "budi", {foo=>'blah', bar=>undef};
     # will format the log message as: Data for budi is {bar=>undef,foo=>"blah"}

DESCRIPTION
    This is the default Log::ger formatter, which: 1) passes the argument
    as-is if there is only a single argument; or, if there are more than one
    argument, 2) treats the arguments like sprintf(), where the first
    argument is the template and the rest are variables to be substituted to
    the conversions inside the template. In the second case, reference
    arguments will be dumped using Data::Dmp or Data::Dumper by default (but
    the dumper is configurable by setting $Log::ger::_dumper; see for
    example Log::ger::UseDataDump or Log::ger::UseDataDumpColor).

    The same code is already included in Log::ger distribution (inside
    Log::ger::Heavy); this distribution just repackages it so it's more
    reusable. It is not part of the standard Log::ger distribution.
