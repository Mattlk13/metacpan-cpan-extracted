NAME
    Log::ger::Plugin::OptAway - Optimize away higher-level log statements

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Plugin->set('OptAway');
     use Log::ger;

    To demonstrate the effect of optimizing away:

     % perl -MLog::ger -MO=Deparse -e'log_warn "foo\n"; log_debug "bar\n"'
     log_warn("foo\n");
     log_debug("bar\n");
     -e syntax OK

     % perl -MLog::ger::Plugin=OptAway -MLog::ger -MO=Deparse -e'log_warn "foo\n"; log_debug "bar\n"'
     log_warn("foo\n");
     '???';
     -e syntax OK

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin replaces logging statements that are higher than the current
    level ($Log::ger::Current_Level) into a no-op statement using
    B::CallChecker magic at compile-time. The logging statements will become
    no-op and will have zero run-time overhead.

    By default, since $Current_Level is pre-set at 3 (warn) then
    "log_info()", "log_debug()", and "log_trace()" calls will be turned into
    no-op.

    Caveats:

    *   must be done at compile-time

    *   only works when you are using procedural style

    *   once optimized away, subsequent logger reinitialization at run-time
        won't take effect
