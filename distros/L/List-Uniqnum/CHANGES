
0.01 - first release

0.02 - fix scoping issue that prevented compilation with some (all ?) Microsoft compilers

0.03 - fix uniqnum for MS compilers

0.04 - provide more efficient version of uv_fits_double()

0.05 - In Uniqnum.xs, change the condition:
       #ifdef _MSC_VER
       to
       #if defined(_MSC_VER) && _MSC_VER < 1900

       I still don't know if "1900" is correct. I believe that the correct
       figure is greater than 1600 and less than or equal to 1924, but
       I haven't yet narrowed it down further.

0.06 - Further improvements to uniqnum().
     - Remove t/02old_uniqnum.t (no longer relevant).
