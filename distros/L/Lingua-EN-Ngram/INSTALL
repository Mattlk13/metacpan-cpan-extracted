INSTALL

Installing this module (Lingua::EN::Ngram) should be trivial since it
requires no dependencies:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

Once installed (or maybe even before) you should be able to see how it
works by:

  $ ngrams ../etc/walden.txt 5
  $ cd bin
  $ ./intersections.pl 5

Enjoy!
