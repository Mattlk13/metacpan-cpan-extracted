VERSION

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Output FileWriteRotate => (
         dir          => '/var/log',    # required
         prefix       => 'myapp',       # required
         #suffix      => '.log',        # default is ''
         size         => 25*1024*1024,  # default is 10MB, unless period is set
         histories    => 12,            # default is 10

     );

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin sends logs to File::Write::Rotate (FWR) object. FWR allows
    autorotation when logging, meaning you don't need an additional external
    process to perform log rotation but FWR can perform the rotation itself.

CONFIGURATION
    These configuration parameters are FWR's. See that module's
    documentation for more details.
