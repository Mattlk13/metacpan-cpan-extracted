NAME
    List::Util::MaybeXS - List::Util but with Pure Perl fallback

SYNOPSIS
      use List::Util::MaybeXS qw(
        reduce any all none notall first reductions

        max maxstr min minstr product sum sum0

        pairs unpairs pairkeys pairvalues pairfirst pairgrep pairmap

        shuffle uniq uniqint uniqnum uniqstr zip mesh
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the same functions as List::Util, but falls back to
    pure perl implementations if the installed List::Util is too old to
    provide them.

    Picking between List::Util's XS accellerated functions and the PP
    versions is done on a per-sub basis, so using this module should never
    result in a slowdown over using List::Util directly.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
    $RAND
        The variables $List::Util::RAND, $List::Util::PP::RAND, and
        $List::Util::MaybeXS::RAND are all aliased to each other. Any of
        them will impact both List::Util::PP and List::Util functions.

DIFFERENCES FROM List::Util
    As the subs provided are implemented in perl, there are some minor
    differences with the interface.

    @_ in blocks
        Inside a callback block (such as "any { }"), @_ will be empty when
        using the pure perl implementation. With the XS implementation, the
        outer @_ will be visible. Under the perl debugger, the XS
        implementation will also not be able to see the outer @_.
