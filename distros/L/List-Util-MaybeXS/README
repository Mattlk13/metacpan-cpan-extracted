NAME
    List::Util::MaybeXS - List::Util but with Pure Perl fallback

SYNOPSIS
      use List::Util::MaybeXS qw(
        any all
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the same functions as List::Util, but falls back to
    pure perl implementations if the installed List::Util is too old to
    provide them.

    Picking between List::Util's XS accellerated functions and the PP
    versions is done on a per-sub basis, so using this module should never
    result in a slowdown over using List::Util directly.

DIFFERENCES FROM List::Util
    As the subs provided are implemented in perl, there are some minor
    differences with the interface.

    @_ in blocks
        Inside a callback block (such as "any { }"), @_ will be empty when
        using the pure perl implementation. With the XS implementation, the
        outer @_ will be visible.
