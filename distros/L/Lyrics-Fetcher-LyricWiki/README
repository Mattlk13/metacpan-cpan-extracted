Lyrics-Fetcher-LyricWiki README
====================================

Lyrics::Fetcher::LyricWiki, as the name suggests, used to fetch lyrics
from www.LyricWiki.org.  Since LyricWiki has been shut down by Fandom,
it now exists only as a deprecation stub so existing users upgrading 
will get a useful error and avoid a pointless HTTP request.

There's *no point* installing this afresh now.
