    Lingua::AR::Tashkeel - Subroutines for handling Arabic Vowels and Vowel
    marks

SYNOPSIS

        use Lingua::AR::Tashkeel qw(strip prune fix);
    
        # Strip all short vowels
        strip('مَكَرُونَة'); ‎# => مكرونة
        # Heuristic for removing short vowels without causing ambiguity
        prune('فَتَّة');    ‎# => فتّة
        # Heuristic for fixing mixed up short and long vowels
        fix('ماحشي');    ‎# => مَحشي 

DESCRIPTION

    Subroutines for working with Arabic long (حروف علة) and short vowels
    (حركات تشكيل)

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

    strip($string)

      Strips away all Arabic short vowels (Tashkeel).

    prune($string)

      Heuristic for pruning the short vowels that a native speaker wouldn't
      write, as leaving them out wouldn't introduce ambiguity.

      This is often preferable to strip, as Shaddas, or Dammas that
      indicate a passive verb are useful clues that one might want to keep.

    fix($string)

      Transliterating from a romanized representation of Arabic to actual
      Arabic script often gives incorrect results regarding short/long
      vowels.

      This subroutine implements a heuristic for fixing such mix ups.
