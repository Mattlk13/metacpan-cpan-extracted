SYNOPSIS

     use Log::Any::For::File::chdir;
     use File::chdir;
    
     $CWD = "foo";
     ...
     $CWD = "bar";
     ...

    Now everytime $CWD is set, the directory name will be logged. To see
    the log messages at the screen, use this for example:

     % TRACE=1 perl -MLog::Any::Adapter=Screen -MLog::Any::For::File::chdir -MFile::chdir -e'$CWD = "foo"; ...'
     [File::chdir] chdir(foo)
