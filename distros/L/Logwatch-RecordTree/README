Logwatch::RecordTree
--------------------

This module provides support for generating logwatch reports.  A
Logwatch::RecordTree object provides a 'log' method for recording
individual events garnered from lines of a log file.  Logged events are
collected and counted.  When logging is complete, printing the tree object
produces a neatly sorted and indented report with multiple levels of
detail.  Various methods and hooks are provided for sorting and massaging
the report.  There is also a subclass (Logwatch::RecordTree::IPv4)
specifically for sorting, identifying, and condensing events keyed to IPv4
addresses.

Example service scripts for dovecot, exim, and http-error (Apache's
error_log) are provided in the extra/ subdirectory.  These scripts would be
placed in the /etc/logwatch/services/scripts directory according to the
normal Logwatch configuration instructions.
