NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Callback - Send Log::Any logs to a subroutine

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.100 of Log::Any::Adapter::Callback
    (from Perl distribution Log-Any-Adapter-Callback), released on
    2020-01-14.

SYNOPSIS
     # say, let's POST each log message to an HTTP API server
     use LWP::UserAgent;
     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;

     use Log::Any::Adapter;
     Log::Any::Adapter->set('Callback',
         min_level    => 'warn',
         logging_cb   => sub {
             my ($method, $self, $format, @params) = @_;
             $ua->post("https://localdomain/log", level=>$method, Content=>$format);
             sleep 1; # don't overload the server
         },
         detection_cb => sub { ... }, # optional, default is: sub { 1 }
     );

DESCRIPTION
    DEPRECATION NOTICE: Log::Any distribution since 1.708 comes with
    Log::Any::Adapter::Capture which does the same thing. I'm deprecating
    this adapter now.

    This adapter lets you specify callback subroutine to be called by
    Log::Any's logging methods (like $log->debug(), $log->error(), etc) and
    detection methods (like $log->is_warning(), $log->is_fatal(), etc.).

    This adapter is used for customized logging, and is mostly a convenient
    construct to save a few lines of code. You could achieve the same effect
    by creating a full Log::Any adapter class.

    Your logging callback subroutine will be called with these arguments:

     ($method, $self, $format, @params)

    where $method is the name of method (like "debug") and ($self, $format,
    @params) are given by Log::Any.
