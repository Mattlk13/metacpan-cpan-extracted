NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Callback - (DEPRECATED)(ADOPTME) Send Log::Any logs
    to a subroutine

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.102 of Log::Any::Adapter::Callback
    (from Perl distribution Log-Any-Adapter-Callback), released on
    2023-11-21.

SYNOPSIS
     # say, let's POST each log message to an HTTP API server
     use LWP::UserAgent;
     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;

     use Log::Any::Adapter;
     Log::Any::Adapter->set('Callback',
         min_level    => 'warn',
         logging_cb   => sub {
             my ($method, $self, $format, @params) = @_;
             $ua->post("https://localdomain/log", level=>$method, Content=>$format);
             sleep 1; # don't overload the server
         },
         detection_cb => sub { ... }, # optional, default is: sub { 1 }
     );

DESCRIPTION
    DEPRECATION NOTICE: Log::Any distribution since 1.708 comes with
    Log::Any::Adapter::Capture which does the same thing. I'm deprecating
    this adapter now.

    This adapter lets you specify callback subroutine to be called by
    Log::Any's logging methods (like $log->debug(), $log->error(), etc) and
    detection methods (like $log->is_warning(), $log->is_fatal(), etc.).

    This adapter is used for customized logging, and is mostly a convenient
    construct to save a few lines of code. You could achieve the same effect
    by creating a full Log::Any adapter class.

    Your logging callback subroutine will be called with these arguments:

     ($method, $self, $format, @params)

    where $method is the name of method (like "debug") and ($self, $format,
    @params) are given by Log::Any.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
