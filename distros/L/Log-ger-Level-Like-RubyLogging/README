NAME
    Log::ger::Level::Like::RubyLogging - Define logging levels like Ruby's
    logging library

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
     # load before 'use Log::ger' in any package/target
     use Log::ger::Level::Like::RubyLogging;

DESCRIPTION
    From the documentation of the Logging library [1]: "Logging is a
    flexible logging library for use in Ruby programs based on the design of
    Java's log4j library. It features a hierarchical logging system, custom
    level names, multiple output destinations per log event, custom
    formatting, and more."

    This module changes the Log::ger levels to:

        unknown => 0,
        fatal   => 10,
        error   => 20,
        warn    => 30,
        info    => 40,
        debug   => 50,
