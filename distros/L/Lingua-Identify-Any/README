NAME
    Lingua::Identify::Any - Detect language of text using one of several
    available backends

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Lingua::Identify::Any (from
    Perl distribution Lingua-Identify-Any), released on 2019-07-08.

SYNOPSIS
     use Lingua::Identify::Any qw(
         detect_text_language
     );

     my $res = detect_text_language(text => 'Blah blah blah');

    Sample result:

     [200, "OK", {
         backend     => 'Lingua::Identify',
         lang_code   => "en",
         confidence  => 0.78, # 1 would mean certainty
         is_reliable => 1,
     }]

DESCRIPTION
    This module offers a common interface to several language detection
    backends.

FUNCTIONS
  detect_text_language
    Usage:

     detect_text_language(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Detect language of text using one of several available backends.

    Backends will be tried in order. When a backend is not available, or
    when it fails to detect the language, the next backend will be tried.
    Currently supported backends:

    *   Lingua::Identify::CLD

    *   Lingua::Identify

    *   WebService::DetectLanguage (only when "try_remote_backends" is set
        to true)

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   backends => *array[str]*

    *   dlcom_api_key => *str*

        API key for detectlanguage.com.

        Only required if you use WebService::DetectLanguage backend.

    *   text* => *str*

    *   try_remote_backends => *bool*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (hash)

    Status: will return 200 status if detection is successful. Otherwise,
    will return 400 if a specified backend is unknown/unsupported, or 500 if
    detection has failed.

    Payload: a hash with the following keys: "backend" (the backend name
    used to produce the result), "lang_code" (str, 2-letter ISO language
    code), "confidence" (float), "is_reliable" (bool).

ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_LINGUA_IDENTIFY_ANY_BACKENDS
    String. Comma-separated list of backends.

  PERL_LINGUA_IDENTIFY_ANY_TRY_REMOTE_BACKENDS
    Boolean. Set the default for "detect_text_language"'s
    "try_remote_backends" argument.

    If set to 1, will also include backends that query remotely, e.g.
    WebService::DetectLanguage.

  PERL_LINGUA_IDENTIFY_ANY_DLCOM_API_KEY
    String. Set the default for "detect_text_language"'s "dlcom_api_key".
