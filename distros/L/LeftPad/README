NAME
    LeftPad - Why should Node.js have all the fun?

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        use LeftPad;

        $string = leftpad( $string, $min_length );
        $string = leftpad( $string, $min_length, $pad_char );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides left padding, just like you'd find for Node.js.

STABILITY
    So that people may depend on this module for their production code, the
    author commits to never delete it from CPAN.

FUNCTIONS
  leftpad
        $string = leftpad( $string, $min_length );
        $string = leftpad( $string, $min_length, $pad_char );

    Returns a copy of the input string with left padding if the input string
    length is less than the minimum length. It pads with spaces unless given
    a pad character as a third argument.

    Zero or negative minimum length returns the input string. Only the first
    character in the pad-character string is used. Undefined warnings are
    suppressed so an undefined input string is treated as an empty string.
