SYNOPSIS

     use Log::ger;
     use Log::ger::LevelFromEnv;
    
     log_warn "blah ...";

DESCRIPTION

    This module sets $Log::ger::Current_Level based on hints from several
    environment variables: LOG_LEVEL (for example, if set to warn or
    warning will set the log level to warning (3)), TRACE (if true, will
    set log level to trace (6)), DEBUG (if true, will set log level to
    debug (5)), VERBOSE (if true, will set log level to info (4)), QUIET
    (if true, will set log level to error (2)).

    This is convenient for CLI programs.
