SYNOPSIS

    Use as LWP::UserAgent subclass:

     use LWP::UserAgent::ProgressAny;
     use Progress::Any::Output;
    
     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::ProgressAny->new;
     Progress::Any::Output->set("TermProgressBarColor");
     my $resp = $ua->get("http://example.com/some-big-file");
     # you will see a progress bar in your terminal

    Use with standard LWP::UserAgent or other subclasses:

     use LWP::UserAgent;
     use LWP::UserAgent::ProgressAny;
     use Progress::Any::Output;
    
     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
     LWP::UserAgent::ProgressAny::__add_handlers($ua);
     Progress::Any::Output->set("TermProgressBarColor");
     my $resp = $ua->get("http://example.com/some-big-file");

DESCRIPTION

    requests with LWP::UserAgent.

    This module uses Progress::Any framework.

SEE ALSO

    LWP::UserAgent::ProgressBar (LU::PB) is a similar module. It uses
    Term::ProgressBar to display progress bar and introduces two new
    methods: get_with_progress and post_with_progress. Compared to
    LWP::UserAgent::ProgressAny (LU::PA): LU::PA uses Progress::Any so you
    can get progress notification via means other than terminal progress
    bar simply by choosing another progress output. LU::PA is also more
    transparent, you don't have to use a different method to do requests.
    Lastly, LU::PA can be used with standard LWP::UserAgent or its other
    subclasses.
