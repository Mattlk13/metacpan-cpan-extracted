    - [POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]
      As it makes no sense to use fail() for error-signalling
      in non-API-level subroutines, fail() now always fails
      at the API level (i.e. at the level of the call stack where
      control leaves the current package). In other words, calling
      fail() in a nested subroutine within a package, fails the
      subroutine where we first entered the package.
      See the documentation for details.
      (Many thanks, Konrad!)

    - Removed all use of smartmatching and given/when for 5.38 compatibility
