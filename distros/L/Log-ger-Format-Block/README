SYNOPSIS

     use Log::ger::Format::Block;
     use Log::ger;

    Calling use Log::ger::OptAway will affect only the current package. You
    should do this before use Log::err (which will create and import the
    logging routines like log_warn et al).

    After that, you can use your logging routine a la Log::Contextual:

     # the following block won't run if debug is off
     log_debug { "the new count in the database is " . $rs->count };
