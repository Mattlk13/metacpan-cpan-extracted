NAME
    Log::ger::Format::Block - Use formatting using block instead of
    sprintf-style

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Format 'Block';
     use Log::ger;

    After that, you can use your logging routine a la Log::Contextual in the
    importing package:

     # the following block won't run if debug is off
     log_debug { "the new count in the database is " . $rs->count };

DESCRIPTION
    Caveat: you have to do this in the compile-time phase (like shown in
    Synopsis).

SEE ALSO
    Log::ger

    Log::Contextual
