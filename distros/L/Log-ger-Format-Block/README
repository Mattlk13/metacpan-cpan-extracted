SYNOPSIS

     use Log::ger::Format 'Block';
     use Log::ger;

    After that, you can use your logging routine a la Log::Contextual:

     # the following block won't run if debug is off
     log_debug { "the new count in the database is " . $rs->count };

    To install only for current package:

     use Log::ger::Format;
     BEGIN { Log::ger->set_for_current_package('Block') }
     use Log::ger;

DESCRIPTION

    Caveat: you have to do this in the compile-time phase (like shown in
    Synopsis).
