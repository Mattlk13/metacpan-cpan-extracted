NAME

    LaTeX::Recode - Encode/Decode chars to/from UTF-8/macros in LaTeX

SYNOPSIS

        use LaTeX::Recode;
    
        my $string       = 'Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī';
        my $latex_string = latex_encode($string);
            # => 'Mu\d{h}ammad ibn M\=us\=a al-Khw\=arizm\={\i}'
    
        my $string = 'Mu\d{h}ammad ibn M\=us\=a al-Khw\=arizm\={\i}';
        my $utf8_string   = latex_decode($string);
            # => 'Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī'
    
    
        # if you want to define a different conversion set (either
        # for encoding or decoding):
        use LaTeX::Recode encode_set => 'full', decode_set => 'base';

DESCRIPTION

    Allows conversion between Unicode chars and LaTeX macros.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

    Possible values for the encoding/decoding set to use are 'null', 'base'
    and 'full'; default value is 'base'.

    null => No conversion

    base => Most common macros and diacritics (sufficient for Western
    languages and common symbols)

    full => Also converts punctuation, larger range of diacritics and
    macros (e.g. for IPA, Latin Extended Additional, etc.), symbols, Greek
    letters, dingbats, negated symbols, and superscript characters and
    symbols ...

 latex_decode($text, @options)

    Converts LaTeX macros in the $text to Unicode characters.

    The function accepts a number of options:

        * normalize => $bool (default 1)
            whether the output string should be normalized with Unicode::Normalize
    
        * normalization => <normalization form> (default 'NFD')
            and if yes, the normalization form to use (see the Unicode::Normalize documentation)

 latex_encode($text, @options)

    Converts UTF-8 to LaTeX

 _init_sets(<decode set>, <encode_set>)

    Initialise recoding sets. This is a private method, and its direct
    usage should not be needed in normal circunstances.
