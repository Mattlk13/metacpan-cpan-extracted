langertha_chat_ollama - Simple chat with Ollama

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  bash$ langertha_chat_ollama write a bash command that lists files older than
  5 days

  Here is the Bash command to list files older than 5 days:

  ```bash
  find . -type f -mtime +5
  ```

  Explanation:

  - `find`: This is the primary command for searching through directories and
    their contents.
  - `.`: Specifies that we want to search from the current directory.
  - `-type f`: Tells find to only consider files (not directories).
  - `-mtime +5`: Specifies that we're interested in files with a last modified
    date more than 5 days ago. The `+` is used for "greater than", and `5`
    specifies how many days.

  Example Use Case:

  To list all the PDFs older than 5 days from your current directory, you can
  use this command:

  ```bash
  find . -type f -name "*.pdf" -mtime +5
  ```

  This will list all files with a `.pdf` extension that are more than 5 days
  old.
