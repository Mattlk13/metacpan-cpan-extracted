0.002   2017-08-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Instantiate Log::Dispatch instead of Log::Dispatch
	  output object so we can pass newline => 1 etc which is handled at
	  the Log::Dispatch level.

        - [Optimize] use create_logml_routine so we don't have to instantiate
	  Log::Dispatch object per logging routine.
