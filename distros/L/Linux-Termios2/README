NAME

    Linux::Termios2 - wrap the Linux-specific struct termios2 structure and
    related

SYNOPSIS

    This module is primarily intended as a helper for IO::Termios, but it
    could also be used directly.

     use Linux::Termios2;
     use POSIX qw( TCSANOW );
    
     my $termios = Linux::Termios2->new;
     $termios->getattr( 0 );
    
     $termios->setospeed( 123456 );
    
     $termios->setattr( 0, TCSANOW ) or
        die "Cannot TCSETS2 - $!";

DESCRIPTION

    This class provides an API equivalent to the POSIX::Termios class,
    except backed by the Linux-specific struct termios2 structure instead.

    It uses the TCGETS2 and TCSETS2 family of ioctl() calls, meaning it has
    access to the arbitrary baud rate ability of the c_ispeed and c_ospeed
    fields with the BOTHER baud setting. These are accessed transparently,
    by simply calling setispeed and setospeed with baud rates in bits per
    second.
