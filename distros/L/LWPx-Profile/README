VERSION

    version 0.2

SYNOPSIS

            use LWP::UserAgent;
            use LWPx::Profile;
            
            my $ua = LWP::UserAgent;
            
            LWPx::Profile::start_profile();
            foreach my $url (@sites) {
                    $ua->get($url);
            }
            my $results = LWPx::Profile::stop_profile;

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a basic profiling framework for looking at how
    long HTTP requests with LWP took to complete. The data structure
    returned by stop_profile is a hashref of request-string => stats pairs.
    For example:

            'GET http://www.google.com/
            User-Agent: libwww-perl/6.08
    
            ' => {
                    'shortest_duration' => '0.111438989639282',
                    'time_of_first_sample' => '1424211134.8376',
                    'longest_duration' => '0.202037811279297',
                    'count' => 3,
                    'total_duration' => '0.436195850372314',
                    'time_of_last_sample' => '1424211135.07221',
                    'first_duration' => '0.202037811279297'
            };

    In this example, there have been three requests for
    http://www.google.com/.

TODO

      * The docs are pretty middling at the moment.
