This is a short set of guidelines for those contributing Lingua::RU::Money::XS.
It's not an iron-clad set of rules, but just things which make life easier when
reading and integrating a patch.


Reporting bugs

- Often the only information we have for fixing a bug is contained in your
  report. So...

- Please report your bugs via http://rt.cpan.org or by mailing <imun@cpan.org>

- Please report your bug immediately upon encountering it. Do not wait until you
  have a patch to fix the bug. Patches are good, but not at the expense of
  timely bug reports.

- Please be as verbose as possible. Include the complete output of your
  'make test' or even 'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1', output of 'uname -a' for your
  machine and example for reproducing. The more data we have to work with, the
  faster we can diagnose the problem.

- If you find an undocumented feature, or if a feature has changed/been added
  which causes a problem, report it. Do not assume it was done deliberately.
  Even if it was done deliberately, we still want to hear if it caused problems.

- If you're testing Lingua::RU::Money::XS against a development version of Perl,
  please also check it against the latest stable version. This makes it easier
  to figure out if it's MakeMaker or Perl at fault.


Pull Request

- If you wrote a patch already, please send it by mailing <imun@cpan.org> so we
  can check it together.

- Patches against master branch of
  https://git.imun.cloud/p5-Lingua-RU-Money-XS.git are prefered.

- Patches against the latest CPAN version are ok, too.


Code formatting

- No spaces for indentation, please use tabs. This allows everyone to configure
  convinient indentaion width.

- snake_case is preferred instead of camelCase though it is module for Perl, not
  for Python.


Backwards Compatibility

- Lingua::RU::Money::XS must be backwards compatible to 5.10.0.


Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Lingua::RU::Money::XS must work on all UNIX architectures Perl works on.


Documentation

- If you're patching an existing method, please document this in accordance with
  the changes and write about reason within BUGS section.

- If you're adding new method, please document this in maximum detail.

- Additional and more verbose documentation would be a present for me.
