NAME
    Lingua::RU::Money::XS - Perl extension for digit conversion to
    corresponding money sum in Russian.

SYNOPSIS
      use Lingua::RU::Money::XS qw(rur2words);
      print rur2words(123456789012345.00)
      # outputs "сто двадцать три триллиона четыреста пятьдесят шесть миллиардов семьсот восемьдесят девять миллионов двенадцать тысяч триста сорок пять рублей 00 копеек"

DESCRIPTION
  SUBROUTINES
    Lingua::RU::Money::XS::rur2words
        "rur2words" returns a given as number money sum in words, i.e.
        *5.10* converts to *пять рублей 10 копеек*. The target charset is
        UTF-8.

    Lingua::RU::Money::XS::all2words
        "all2words" returns a given as number money sum in words, i.e.
        *5.10* converts to *пять рублей десять копеек*. The target charset
        is UTF-8.

    Caution: Current implementation of "rur2words" and "all2words" follows
    the Perl philosophy - anyway the given argument will be casted to
    "double".

    Caution: Due to previous caution there are several constraints, making
    conversion impossible. These constraints divide input values into 4
    groups listed below

    *amount less than 0*
            Conversion for specified values make no sense. Thus, conversion
            croaks for all these values.

    *amount between 0 and 1e12*
            Any value in this range converts correctly with the specified
            accuracy.

    *amount between 1e12 and 1e15*
            Due to the lack for significant digits after the radix point for
            some values in this range, kopeck value is calculated
            inaccurate. It simply is replaced with the 0 with the
            corresponding warning.

    *amount greater or equal than 1e15*
            Conversion for these values is impossible due to the type
            overflow. Conversion also croaks for all these values.

  EXPORT
    Nothing is exported by default.

  SUPPORTED VERSIONS OF PERL
    Please note that this module works only on Perl 5.10.0 and newer.

    Caution: Though the version 0.06 of current module works with Perl
    5.10.0, *it cannot be used in Perl older 5.16.0* due to typo within this
    package. Please use version 0.07 instead.
