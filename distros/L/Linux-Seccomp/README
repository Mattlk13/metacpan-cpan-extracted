Linux-Seccomp version 0.001
===========================

Secure Computing (seccomp) is Linux's system call filtering mechanism.
This system can operate in two modes: I<strict>, where only a very
small number of system calls are allowed and the more modern I<filter>
(or seccomp mode 2) which permits advanced filtering of system calls.
This module is only concerned with the latter.

Linux::Seccomp is a Perl interface to the
L<libseccomp|https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp> library which
provides a simple way to use seccomp mode 2.

It should be mentioned that this module is not production-ready at the
moment -- work needs to be done to port the libseccomp testsuite and
the documentation needs to be improved.
