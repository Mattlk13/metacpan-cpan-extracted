 - Implement some simple SQL joins in the database instead of in Perl.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - If `where` is called on a LINQ::Table that already has an SQL select,
   `where` should be applied to the output of `select`, not to the `input`.
 - `sql_where` should be passed through `assertion_to_sql`, not
   `selection_to_sql`.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - More test cases for WHERE and combining SELECT with WHERE.
