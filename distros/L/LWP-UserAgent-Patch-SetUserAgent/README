SYNOPSIS
    In Perl:

     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::SetUserAgent -agent => "Blah/1.0";

    From command-line:

     % perl -MLWP::UserAgent::Patch::SetUserAgent=-agent,'Blah/1.0' script-that-uses-lwp.pl ...
     % HTTP_USER_AGENT=Blah/1.0 perl -MLWP::UserAgent::Patch::SetUserAgent script-that-uses-lwp.pl ...

DESCRIPTION
    This patch sets LWP::UserAgent's default User-Agent string, from
    "libwww-perl/XXX" to a value from either "-agent" configuration or from
    environment variable "HTTP_USER_AGENT".

    You can still override it using the usual:

     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(
         agent => '...',
         ...
     );

    or

     $ua->agent('...');

CONFIGURATION
  -agent
    String.

ENVIRONMENT
