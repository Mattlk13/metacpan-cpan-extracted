NAME

    Log::Any::Adapter::Sentry::Raven - Log::Any::Adapter for Sentry::Raven

VERSION

    version v0.0.3

DESCRIPTION

    This is a backend to Log::Any for Sentry::Raven.

    When logging, it does its best to provide a Devel::StackTrace to
    identify your message. To accomplish this, it uses
    Devel::StackTrace::Extract to pull a trace from your message (if you
    pass multiple message arguments, it won't attempt this). Failing that,
    it will append a new Devel::StackTrace.

    It takes two arguments:

    sentry (REQUIRED)

      An instantiated Sentry::Raven object. Note that if you set any
      sentry-specific context directly through the sentry object, it will
      be picked up here eg.

          $sentry->add_context( Sentry::Raven->request_context($url, %p) )

    log_level (OPTIONAL)

      The minimum log_level to log. Defaults to trace (everything).

    Any "Log context data" in Log::Any will be sent to Sentry as tags.

SYNPOSIS

        use Log::Any::Adapter;
        Log::Any::Adapter->set('Sentry::Raven',
            sentry => Sentry::Raven->new(
                sentry_dsn  => $dsn,
                environment => 'production',
                ...
            )
        );
