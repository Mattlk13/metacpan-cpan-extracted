NAME
    Log::ger::Layout::LTSV - Layout log message as LTSV

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Log::ger::Layout::LTSV (from
    Perl distribution Log-ger-Layout-LTSV), released on 2019-04-12.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::Layout LTSV => (
         add_fields         => {key3 => 'value', key4 => 'value', ...},         # optional
         add_special_fields => {_date => 'Date_GMT', _host => 'Hostname', ...}, # optional
         delete_fields      => ['key1', 'key2', qr/some-regex/, ...],           # optional
     );
     use Log::ger;

     # if you use it together with Log::ger::Format::None:
     log_warn({key1 => 'val1', key2 => 'val2', foo => 'bar', ...);

     # otherwise, using the standard formatter:
     log_warn("blah %s", ['some', 'data']);

    The final message will be something like:

     _date:2017-06-28T14:08:22      _host:example.com       foo:bar key3:value      key4:value

    or:

     _date:2017-06-28T14:08:22      _host:example.com       message:blah ["some","data"]

DESCRIPTION
    This layouter allows you to log message as LTSV row. If you use
    Log::ger::Format::None, you can pass a hashref. Otherwise, the message
    will be put in "message" label. You can then delete keys then add
    additional fields/keys (including special fields, a la
    Log::ger::Layout::Pattern).

CONFIGURATION
  add_fields => hash
  add_special_fields => hash
    Known special fields:

     Category: Category of the logging event

     Date_GMT: Current date in ISO8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD<T>hh:mm:ss) (GMT)
