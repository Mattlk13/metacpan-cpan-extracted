NAME
    Log::ger::Level::Like::LogAny - Define logging levels like Log::Any

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
     # load before 'use Log::ger' in any package/target
     use Log::ger::Level::Like::LogAny;

DESCRIPTION
    This module changes the Log::ger levels to:

        emergency => 5,
        alert     => 6,
        critical  => 10,
        crit      => 10, # = critical
        fatal     => 10, # = critical
        error     => 20,
        err       => 20, # = error
        warning   => 30,
        warn      => 30, # = warning
        notice    => 35,
        info      => 40,
        inform    => 40, # = info
        debug     => 50,
        trace     => 60,

    Note that the exact numerical constants differ from definitions in
    Log::Any::Adapter::Util. The numbers are adjusted so things like
    Log::ger::Output::Screen can show colors that are more equivalent.

    The aliases names are defined as proper levels too so you get
    "log_crit", "log_err", and so on.
