NAME

    Log::Any::Adapter::Log4perlTiny - Log::Any adapter for
    Log::Log4perl::Tiny

VERSION

    This document describes Log::Any::Adapter::Log4perlTiny version 0.001.

SYNOPSIS

       use Log::Log4perl::Tiny qw< LOGLEVEL >;
       use Log::Any::Adapter 'Log4perlTiny';
    
       LOGLEVEL('DEBUG');

DESCRIPTION

    This Log::Any adapter uses Log::Log4perl::Tiny under the hood. It does
    not need to be initialized as it comes with some sensible defaults;
    users might anyway be interested into setting a different log level
    dinamically, so importing LOGLEVEL might be beneficial.

INTERFACE

    Methods for checking the activity of levels are generated dynamically;
    as of the generation of this module, they are:

    is_alert

    is_critical

    is_debug

    is_emergency

    is_error

    is_info

    is_notice

    is_trace

    is_warning

    In addition, the method in the following sub-section is available.

 structured

       $object->structured($level, $category, @stuff);

    The provided $level is mapped onto one of the available ones; unknown
    levels are mapped onto FATAL (this might be the case if Log::Any
    introduces any new levels in the future).

    The $category is ignored, as there is a single instance.

    The @stuff is passed onto to Log::Log4perl::Tiny.
