SYNOPSIS

     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::HTTPSHardTimeout -timeout => 300;

DESCRIPTION

    This module contains a simple workaround for hanging issue with HTTPS
    requests. It wraps send_request() with an alarm() timeout.

    Can be used with WWW::Mechanize because it uses LWP::UserAgent.

FAQ

 Why not subclass?

    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP::UserAgent (or WWW::Mechanize, and so on).
