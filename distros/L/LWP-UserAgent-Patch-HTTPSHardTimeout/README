NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::Patch::HTTPSHardTimeout - Add hard timeout to HTTPS
    requests

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.070 of
    LWP::UserAgent::Patch::HTTPSHardTimeout (from Perl distribution
    LWP-UserAgent-Patch-HTTPSHardTimeout), released on 2018-03-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::HTTPSHardTimeout -timeout => 300;

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains a simple workaround for hanging issue with HTTPS
    requests. It wraps send_request() with an alarm() timeout.

    Can be used with WWW::Mechanize because it uses LWP::UserAgent.

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP::UserAgent (or WWW::Mechanize, and so on).
