VERSION
    This document describes version 0.062 of Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate
    (from Perl distribution Log-Dispatch-FileWriteRotate), released on
    2021-07-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate;

     my $file = Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate(
         min_level => 'info',

         # will be passed to File::Write::Rotate
         dir       => '/var/log',
         prefix    => 'myapp',
         suffix    => '.log',
         period    => 'monthly',
         size      => 25*1024*1024,
         histories => 12,
     );

     $file->log(level => 'info', message => "Your comment\n");

DESCRIPTION
    This module functions similarly to Log::Dispatch::FileRotate, but uses
    File::Write::Rotate as backend, thus interoperates more easily with
    other modules which use File::Write::Rotate as backend, e.g.
    Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate or Process::Govern.

    documentation); "dir", "prefix", "suffix", "period", "size", and
    "histories" (see File::Write::Rotate).

  log_message(message => STR)

    LLog::Dispatch::Output>).
