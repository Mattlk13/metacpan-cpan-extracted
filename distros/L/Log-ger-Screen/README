NAME
    Log::ger::Screen - Convenient packaging of Log::ger + Lg:Output::Screen
    + Lg:Level::FromVar + Lg:Level::FromEnv for one-liner

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
    Mostly in one-liners:

     % perl -MLog::ger::Screen -E'log_warn "blah..."; ...'

    Set level from package variable (see Log::ger::Level::FromVar for more
    details):

     % perl -E'BEGIN { $Default_Log_Level = 'info' } use Log::ger::Screen; ...'

    Set level from environment variable (see Log::ger::Level::FromEnv for
    more details):

     % TRACE=1 perl ...

    But you can certainly use this module in your CLI script, as a more
    lightweight alternative to Log::ger::App when you only want to output
    log to screen:

     #!perl
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     BEGIN { our $Default_Log_Level = 'info' }
     use Log::ger::Screen;
     use Log::ger;

     use Getopt::Long;

     log_debug "Starting program ...";
     ...
     log_debug "Ending program ...";

DESCRIPTION
    This is just a convenient packaging of:

     use Log::ger::Level::FromVar;
     use Log::ger::Level::FromEnv;
     use Log::ger::Output 'Screen';
     use Log::ger; # in the caller's package

    mostly for one-liner usage, but you are also welcome to use it in your
    CLI scripts.
