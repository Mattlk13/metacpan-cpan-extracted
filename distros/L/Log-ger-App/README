NAME
    Log::ger::App - An easy way to use Log::ger in applications

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::App;

DESCRIPTION
    This module sets up sensible defaults for Log::ger::Output::Composite
    from the environment variables.

    Outputs:

     Code                            Screen  File                   Syslog
     ------------------------------  ------  ----                   ------
     One-liner (-e)                  y       -                      -
     Script running as normal user   y       ~/PROGNAME.log         -
     Script running as root          y       /var/log/PROGNAME.log  -
     Daemon                          -       /var/log/PROGNAME.log  y

    General log level: the default is warn (like Log::ger's default). You
    can set it from environment using LOG_LEVEL (e.g. "LOG_LEVEL=trace" to
    set level to trace or LOG_LEVEL=0 to turn off logging). Alternatively,
    you can set to trace using "TRACE=1", or debug with "DEBUG=1", info with
    "VERBOSE=1", error with "QUIET=1".

    Per-output level: the default is to use general level, but you can set a
    different level using
    *OUTPUT_NAME*_{"LOG_LEVEL|TRACE|DEBUG|VERBOSE|QUIET"}.

FUNCTIONS
  $pkg->import(%args)
    Arguments:

    *   level => str|num

        Explicitly set level.

    *   name => str

        Explicitly set program name. Otherwise, default will be taken from
        $0 (after path and '.pl' suffix is removed) or set to "prog".

    *   daemon => bool

        Explicitly tell Log::ger::App that your application is a daemon or
        not. Otherwise, Log::ger::App will try some heuristics to guess
        whether your application is a daemon: from the value of
        $main::IS_DAEMON and from the presence of modules like HTTP::Daemon,
        Proc::Daemon, etc.

ENVIRONMENT
  LOG_LEVEL => str
    Can be set to "off" or numeric/string log level.

  TRACE => bool
  DEBUG => bool
  VERBOSE => bool
  QUIET => bool
