=head1 NAME

Lab::Moose::Countdown - Verbose countdown/delay with pretty printing of remaining time

=head1 VERSION

version 3.731

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lab::Moose::Countdown;

 # Sleep for 23.45678 seconds with pretty countdown
 countdown(23.45678, "Getting ready, Remaining time is ");

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 countdown

 my $delay = 2 # seconds
 countdown($delay)

 my $prefix = "Some prefix text";
 countdown($delay, $prefix);

Replacement for C<Time::HiRes::sleep>. Pretty print the remaining
hours/minutes/seconds. If the argument is smaller than 0.5 seconds, no
countdown is printed and the function behaves exactly like C<Time::HiRes::sleep>.
Default C<$prefix> is C<"Sleeping for">.
