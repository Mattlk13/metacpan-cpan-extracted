NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Retry - Add retries

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.050 of LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Retry
    (from Perl distribution LWP-UserAgent-Patch-Retry), released on
    2019-09-20.

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Retry -n => 2, -delay => 3;

DESCRIPTION
    This patch adds retries to LWP::UserAgent when response from request is
    not a success.

    Can be used with WWW::Mechanize because that module uses LWP::UserAgent.

CONFIGURATION
  -n => INT (default: 2)
    Number of retries. Default is 2, which means it will retry twice (so the
    total number of requests is 3).

  -delay => INT (default: 3)
    Delay between retries, in seconds.

  -criteria => CODE
    Specify custom criteria of whether to retry. Will be passed "($self,
    $response)" and should return 1 if retry should be performed. For
    example if you do not want to retry on 404 errors:

     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Retry
         -criteria => sub {
             my ($self, $resp) = @_;
             return 1 if !$resp->is_success && $resp->code != 404;
         };

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP::UserAgent (or WWW::Mechanize, and so on).
