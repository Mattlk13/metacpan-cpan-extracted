These are thing I would like to have done with RCX.pm in the
future


Short term
===========

Make uploadDatalog handle multi-byte gets.

Check for errors in the responses.  This would include making
sure the opcode is ok and the complement bytes match.

Add a test.pl

Medium term
============

Add support for Win32 Comm.

Abstract out the communications layer so I can affectively add support
for other communications mechanisms.  Possibly even a networked RCX.
( a RCX connected to some other computer on the network ).

Add support for loading in NQC output files (not the list files) to
determine variable names.

Long term
==========

Implement the file loading (sub, task) and flash loading.

Make a PerlTk interface to control your RCX (I have already
started this project but it is far from releasable.)
