NAME

    Log::Any::Adapter::MojoLog - Log::Any integration for Mojo::Log

SYNOPSIS

        use Mojo::Log;
        use Log::Any::Adapter;
    
        Log::Any::Adapter->set('MojoLog', logger => Mojo::Log->new);

    Mojolicious app:

        use Mojo::Base 'Mojolicious';
    
        use Log::Any::Adapter;
    
        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;
    
            Log::Any::Adapter->set('MojoLog', logger => $self->app->log);
        }

    Mojolicious::Lite app:

        use Mojolicious::Lite;
    
        use Log::Any::Adapter;
    
        Log::Any::Adapter->set('MojoLog', logger => app->log);

DESCRIPTION

    This Log::Any adapter uses Mojo::Log for logging. Mojo::Log must be
    initialized before calling set. The parameter logger must be used to
    pass in the logging object.

LOG LEVEL TRANSLATION

    Log levels are translated from Log::Any to Mojo::Log as follows:

        trace -> debug
        notice -> info
        warning -> warn
        critical -> fatal
        alert -> fatal
        emergency -> fatal

NOTES

    This module was forked from Log::Any::Adapter::Mojo which bears the
    copyright

    Copyright (C) 2011 Henry Tang

    and is licensed under the Artistic License version 2.0

    This fork began as fixes for RT#111631
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=111631> and RT#101167
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=101167>. However the
    eventual changes that were made prevented any possibility for keeping a
    consistent log formatter. As such I think it is the responsible action
    to fork the module to release it. I intend to work with the original
    author to see how much of these changes can be backported into that
    codebase without breaking the format.
