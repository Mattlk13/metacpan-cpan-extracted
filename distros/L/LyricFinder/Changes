Revision history for LyricFinder

1.00    2020/12/15
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        (Converted from David Precious's Lyric::Fetcher and friends)
1.01    2021/01/15
        - LyricFinder::Musixmatch - Handle non/high/wide/utf8 ascii characters 
        in artist and title fields, ie. accented characters - Musixmatch.com 
        allows these in searches and encodes them in the page URL.
        - Add URI::Escape to prerequesites.
        - Small Pod/doc. tweaks.
1.02    2021/05/11
        - LyricFinder::Musixmatch - Fix bug that cut off first few lines 
        of lyrics (due to their site separating an abreviated version of the 
        first few lines from the rest of the lyrics).  Also added a 
        "(Musixmatch status:  ok|warning|error)" line at bottom indicating 
        what Musixmatch thinks of the state of the selected song's lyrics.
1.03    2021/05/13
        - Added LyricFinder::Letras (https://www.letras.mus.br).
        - Added optional integer 4th argument to LyricFinder->fetch() to 
        allow limiting # of sites tried (Default is to try all (currently 
        5 sites installed) until lyrics are found.  Use this with the 
        'random' option to limit the time spent searching before giving up.
        If zero or >= 5 (current # of sites), all 5 sites will be tried.
        - LyricFinder::Genius: Add conversions of accented characters to 
        their unaccented equivalents to handle some non-English artist and 
        song names.
