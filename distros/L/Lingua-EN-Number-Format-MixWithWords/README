SYNOPSIS

     use Lingua::EN::Number::Format::MixWithWords qw(format_number_mix);
    
     print format_number_mix(num => 1.23e7); # prints "12.3 million"

DESCRIPTION

    This module formats number with English names of large numbers
    (thousands, millions, billions, and so on), e.g. 1.23e7 becomes "12.3
    million". If number is too small or too large so it does not have any
    appropriate names, it will be formatted like a normal number.
