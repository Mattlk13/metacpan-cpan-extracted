SYNOPSIS
    Return the ranks of the elements if sorted numerically (note that equal
    values will be given equal ranks):

     my @ranks = rank 10, 30, 20, 20; # => 1, 4, "2=", "2="

    Return the ranks of the elements if sorted ascibetically:

     my @ranks = rankstr "apricot", "cucumber", "banana", "banana"; # => 1,4,"2=","2="

    Return the ranks of the elements if sorted by a custom sorter:

     my @ranks = rankby {length($a) <=> length($b)}
         "apricot", "cucumber", "banana", "banana"; # => 3, 4, "1=", "1="

    Sort the list numerically and return the elements as well as ranks in
    pairs:

     my @res = sortrank 10, 30, 20, 20; => 10,1, 20,"2=", 20,"2=", 30,4

    Sort the list ascibetically and return the elements as well as ranks in
    pairs:

     my @res = sortrankstr "apricot", "cucumber", "banana", "banana";
         # => "apricot",1, "banana","2=", "banana","2=", "cucumber",4

    Sort the list by a custom sorter and return the elements as well as
    ranks in pairs:

     my @res = sortrankby "apple", "cucumber", "banana", "banana";
         # => "banana","1=", "banana","1=", "apricot",3, "cucumber",4
