NAME
    Log::ger::Like::LogAny - Log like Log::Any

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
    To switch your code from Log::Any to Log::ger, replace this:

     use Log::Any;
     use Log::Any '$log';

    to:

     use Log::ger::Like::LogAny;
     use Log::ger::Like::LogAny '$log';

    The rest of this works in Log::Any as well as under
    Log::ger::Like::LogAny:

     my $log = Log::Any->get_logger(category => 'My::Package');

     $log->debug("blah ...", "more blah ...");
     $log->tracef("fmt %s %s", "blah ...", {data=>'structure'});

     if ($log->is_trace) {
        ...
     }

    To set output, use one of the available Log::ger::Output::*. You can
    send logs to Log::Any using Log::ger::Output::LogAny.

DESCRIPTION
    This module mimics Log::Any-like logging interface. The idea is that you
    replace the "use" statement like shown in the Synopsis and you're done
    switching. Useful for code that uses Log::Any. Not everything is
    supported though (see the above Synopsis).
