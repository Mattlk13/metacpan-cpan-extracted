SYNOPSIS
     # load before 'use Log::ger' in any package/target
     use Log::ger::Level::Like::Mojo;

DESCRIPTION
    This module changes the Log::ger levels to:

        fatal     => 10,
        error     => 20,
        warn      => 30,
        info      => 40,
        debug     => 50,

    which is just like the default except for the absence of "trace".
