Appropriate handling of multiple mapped reads during mapping analyses remains an issue that demands improvement.\r\nResults: \r\nThe capabilities of the read mapping analysis and visualization tool ReadXplorer were vastly enhanced. Here, we present an even finer granulated read mapping classification, improving the level of detail for analyses and visualizations. The spectrum of automatic analysis functions has been broadened to include genome rearrangement detection as well as correlation analysis between two mapping data sets. Existing functions were refined and enhanced, namely the computation of differ-entially expressed genes, the read count and normalization analysis and the transcription start site (TSS) detection. Additionally, ReadXplorer 2 features a highly improved support for large eukaryotic data sets and a command line version, enabling its integration into workflows. Finally, the new version is now able to display any kind of tabular results from other bioinformatics tools. \r\nAvailability: \r\nhttp://www.readxplorer.org","lang":"eng"}],"_id":"100","urn":"urn:nbn:de:0070-pub-29051706","edit_mode":"normal","citation":{"chicago":"<div style=\"text-indent:-25px; padding-left:25px;padding-bottom:0px;\">Hilker, Rolf, Stadermann, Kai Bernd, Schwengers, Oliver, Anisiforov, Evgeny, Jaenicke, Sebastian, Weisshaar, Bernd, Zimmermann, Tobias, and Goesmann, Alexander. 2016. “ReadXplorer 2 - detailed read mapping analysis and visualization from one single source”. <em>Bioinformatics</em> 32 (24): 3702-3708.</div>","aps":" R.

The process of attachment of the agrobacteria to plant cells and the transport of T-DNA into the cell and further to the nucleus has been well described. However, the exact mechanism of integration into the host's DNA is still unclear, although several models have been proposed. During confirmation of T-DNA insertion alleles from the GABI-Kat collection of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, we have generated about 34 000 sequences from the junctions between inserted T-DNA and adjacent genome regions. Here, we describe the evaluation of this dataset with regard to existing models for T-DNA integration. The results suggest that integration into the plant genome is mainly mediated by the endogenous plant DNA repair machinery. The observed integration events showed characteristics highly similar to those of repair sites of double-strand breaks with respect to microhomology and deletion sizes. In addition, we describe unexpected integration events, such as large deletions and inversions at the integration site that are relevant for correct interpretation of results from T-DNA insertion mutants in reverse genetics experiments."}],"_id":"200","date_updated":"2016-02-22T07:32:29Z","first_author":"Kleinbölting, Nils","author":[{"id":"10616931","first_name":"Nils","last_name":"Kleinbölting","full_name":"Kleinbölting, Nils"},{"id":"189559","first_name":"Gunnar","full_name":"Huep, Gunnar","last_name":"Huep"},{"id":"5650861","first_name":"Ingo","last_name":"Appelhagen","full_name":"Appelhagen, Ingo"},{"first_name":"Prisca","last_name":"Viehöver","full_name":"Viehöver, Prisca","id":"159120"},{"first_name":"Yong","last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li, Yong"},{"id":"86212","first_name":"Bernd","last_name":"Weisshaar","full_name":"Weisshaar, Bernd","orcid":"0000-0002-7635-3473"}],"intvolume":"         8","citation":{"wels":"Kleinbölting, N.; Huep, G.; Appelhagen, I.; Viehöver, P.; Li, Y.; Weisshaar, B.
