NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine - Rinci/Riap-based command-line application framework

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.913.0 of Perinci::CmdLine (from Perl
    distribution Perinci-CmdLine), released on 2021-12-03.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is currently empty, because the implementation is currently
    split into Perinci::CmdLine::Lite (the lightweight version) and
    Perinci::CmdLine::Classic (the full but heavier version). There's also
    Perinci::CmdLine::Any that lets you choose between the two dynamically,
    Ã  la Any::Moose. And finally there's also Perinci::CmdLine::Inline, the
    even more lightweight version.

    This module exists solely for convenience of linking purposes.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
