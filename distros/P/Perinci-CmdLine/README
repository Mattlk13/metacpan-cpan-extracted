DESCRIPTION

    This module is currently empty, because the implementation is currently
    split into Perinci::CmdLine::Lite (the lightweight version) and
    Perinci::CmdLine::Classic (the full but heavier version). There's also
    Perinci::CmdLine::Any that lets you choose between the two dynamically,
    à la Any::Moose. And finally there's also Perinci::CmdLine::Inline, the
    even more lightweight version.

    This module exists solely for convenience of linking purposes.
