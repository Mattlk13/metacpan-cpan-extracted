=head1 NAME

Perinci::CmdLine - Rinci/Riap-based command-line application framework

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.50 of Perinci::CmdLine (from Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine), released on 2016-12-10.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is currently empty, because the implementation is currently split
into L<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite> (the lightweight version) and
L<Perinci::CmdLine::Classic> (the full but heavier version). There's also
L<Perinci::CmdLine::Any> that lets you choose between the two dynamically, Ã  la
Any::Moose. And finally there's also L<Perinci::CmdLine::Inline>, the even more
lightweight version.

This module exists solely for convenience of linking purposes.
