=head1 NAME

Perinci::CmdLine - Rinci/Riap-based command-line application framework

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.913.0 of Perinci::CmdLine (from Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine), released on 2021-12-03.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is currently empty, because the implementation is currently split
into L<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite> (the lightweight version) and
L<Perinci::CmdLine::Classic> (the full but heavier version). There's also
L<Perinci::CmdLine::Any> that lets you choose between the two dynamically, Ã  la
Any::Moose. And finally there's also L<Perinci::CmdLine::Inline>, the even more
lightweight version.

This module exists solely for convenience of linking purposes.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
