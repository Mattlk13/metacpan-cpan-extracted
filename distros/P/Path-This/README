NAME

    Path::This - Path to this source file or directory

SYNOPSIS

      use Path::This '$THISFILE';
      print "This file is $THISFILE\n";
    
      use Path::This '$THISDIR';
      use lib "$THISDIR/../lib";

DESCRIPTION

    Exports package variables by request that represent the current source
    file or directory containing that file. Dynamic or constant sub
    versions can also be requested. Paths will be absolute with symlinks
    resolved.

    Note that the package variable or constant sub will be exported to the
    current package globally. If the same package will be used in multiple
    files, use the dynamic sub export so the file path will be calculated
    when the sub is called.

EXPORTS

 $THISFILE

 &THISFILE

 THISFILE

      print "$THISFILE\n";
      my $file = THISFILE;

    Absolute path to the current source file. Behavior is undefined when
    called without a source file (e.g. from the command line or STDIN).
    $THISFILE will export a package variable, &THISFILE will export a
    dynamic subroutine, and THISFILE will export an inlinable constant.

 $THISDIR

 &THISDIR

 THISDIR

      print "$THISDIR\n";
      my $dir = THISDIR;

    Absolute path to the directory containing the current source file, or
    the current working directory when called without a source file (e.g.
    from the command line or STDIN). $THISDIR will export a package
    variable, &THISDIR will export a dynamic subroutine, and THISDIR will
    export an inlinable constant.
