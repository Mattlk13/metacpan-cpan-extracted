NAME
    Perinci::Result::Format::Lite - Format enveloped result

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.283 of Perinci::Result::Format::Lite
    (from Perl distribution Perinci-Result-Format-Lite), released on
    2022-01-21.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  format($res, $format[ , $is_naked=0, $cleanse=1 ]) => str
ENVIRONMENT
  FORMAT_PRETTY_TABLE_BACKEND => str
    If this is set, will render text table using Text::Table::Any (with
    "backend" set to the value of this environment variable) instead of the
    default Text::Table::Sprintf. This is useful if you want to output text
    table in a different format, for example to generate Org tables (make
    sure Text::Table::Org backend is already installed):

     % FORMAT_PRETTY_TABLE_BACKEND=Text::Table::Org lcpan rdeps Getopt::Lucid

    For convenience, a default is chosen for you under certain condition.
    When inside Emacs (environment "INSIDE_EMACS" is set),
    "Text::Table::Org" is used as default.

  FORMAT_PRETTY_TABLE_COLUMN_ORDERS => array (json)
    Set the default of "table_column_orders" in "format_options" in result
    metadata, similar to what's implemented in Perinci::Result::Format and
    Data::Format::Pretty::Console.

  COLOR => bool

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
