NAME

    Pinto::Remote::SelfContained - interact with a remote Pinto repository

DESCRIPTION

    Pinto::Remote::SelfContained is a partial clone of Pinto::Remote, but
    without the server parts, and therefore a much smaller dependency
    graph. Documentation can be found in that module.

    This class exists for situations where your organisation is using
    Pinto, and doesn't currently have the bandwidth to move away from it to
    any alternative, but wants something smaller than the whole of Pinto
    for interacting with the remote repo.

METHODS

 run($action_name => %action_args)

    Loads the Action subclass for the given $action_name and constructs an
    object using the given $action_args. If the subclass
    Pinto::Remote::SelfContained::Action::$action_name does not exist, then
    it falls back to the Pinto::Remote::SelfContained::Action base class.
