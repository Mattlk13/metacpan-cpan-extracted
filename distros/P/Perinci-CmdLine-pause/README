DESCRIPTION

    This class adds a hook_after_read_config_file to read CPAN::Uploader's
    config file in ~/.pause. Encrypted .pause is not supported.

    This module is distributed separately from App::pause because we want
    pause to be fatpacked and depends only on a few other modules
    (LWP::UserAgent and LWP::Protocol::https).
