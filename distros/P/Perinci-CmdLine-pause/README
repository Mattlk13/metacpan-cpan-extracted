NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::pause - Perinci::CmdLine::Lite subclass for pause

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.310 of Perinci::CmdLine::pause (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-pause), released on 2020-09-18.

DESCRIPTION
    This class adds a hook_after_read_config_file to read CPAN::Uploader's
    config file in "~/.pause". Encrypted ".pause" is not supported.

    This module is distributed separately from App::pause because we want
    pause to be fatpacked and depends only on a few other modules
    (LWP::UserAgent and LWP::Protocol::https).
