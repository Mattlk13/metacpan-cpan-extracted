Parser::AAMVA::License is designed to parse and decode the information
held on a standard driver's license issued in the US, Canada and parts 
of Mexico by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
You can find the full definition at http://www.aamva.org.

Magnetic stripe data is typically encoded with 'sentinel' characters at the 
start and end of each track.  The module will automatically strip newline
characters, but other characters may be present depending on the 
programming in your stripe reader.

Only the license holder's name and address are available on Track 1.

The more commonly used birth date, license number and expiration date
are found on Track 2.

Track 3 contains more personal specifics such as height, weight and 
eye color. 

Tracks 2 or 3 may not present if the stripe reader cannot read those 
tracks or if they are turned off.
