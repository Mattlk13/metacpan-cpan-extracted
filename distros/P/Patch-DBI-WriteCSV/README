NAME
    Patch::DBI::WriteCSV - Patch DBI to also write CSV while fetching rows

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Patch::DBI::WriteCSV (from Perl
    distribution Patch-DBI-WriteCSV), released on 2018-12-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use DBI;
     require Patch:DBI::WriteCSV;
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", "someuser", "somepass");

     {
         Patch::DBI::WriteCSV->import; # start writing CSV
         my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM member");
         while (my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
             # do something with $row
         }
         Patch::DBI::WriteCSV->unimport; # no longer write CSV
     }

    The above code will print CSV to STDOUT, e.g.:

     Name,Rank,Serial
     alice,pvt,123456
     bob,cpl,98765321
     carol,"brig gen",8745

DESCRIPTION
    This package patches the following DBI methods:

     fetchrow_array
     fetchrow_arrayref
     fetchrow_hashref
     fetchall_arrayref
     fetchall_hashref

    to also write CSV while fetching row(s). By default it writes to STDOUT
    but this can be customized (see "IMPORTS").

    Compared to solution like DBIx::CSV, this solution does not introduce
    new methods to DBI's database/statement handle, so producing CSV can be
    easier when you do not use DBI directly, like when you use DBIx::Class.

IMPORTS
    Usage:

     Patch::DBI::WriteCSV->import(%opts);

    Known options:

    *   csv

        A Text::CSV object to use. If not specified, will instantiate a new
        default one:

         Text::CSV->new

    *   handle

        File handle to write CSV to. Defaults to STDOUT if this as well as
        "filename" is not specified.

    *   filename

        File name to open (in append-mode) to write CSV to.
