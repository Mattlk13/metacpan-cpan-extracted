NAME

    Package::Checkpoint - Checkpoint the scalar, array and hash values in a
    package for later restoration

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     package Foo::Bar {
       our $foo = 1;
       our @bar = (1,2,3);
       our %baz = ( a => 1 );
     }
    
     my $cp = Package::Checkpoint->new('Foo::Bar');
    
     # modify Foo::Bar
     $Foo::Bar::foo++;
     push @Foo::Bar::bar, 4;
     $Foo::Bar::baz{b} = 2;
    
     $cp->restore;
     # [$@%]Foo::Bar::{foo,bar,baz} are now back to their original values

DESCRIPTION

    This module saves the scalars, array and hash variables inside a
    package. It doesn't save anything else, including anything in any
    sub-packages. The intent is if you are storing app configuration in a
    package, you can checkpoint the config, make changes, test those
    changes, and then restore the old values. Probably a better pattern
    would be to store the configuration in another type of object like a
    single hash variable, but sometimes that may not be an option due to
    the age and complexity of an application.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

     my $cp = Package::Checkpoint->new($package);

    Creates a checkpoint for a package, saving all of the scalar, array and
    hash values for later restoration.

METHODS

 restore

     $cp->restore;

    Restores the scalar, array and hash values from the checkpoint.

CAVEATS

    Doesn't checkpoint or even consider a whole host of values that might
    be of interest, like subroutines or file handles.
