NAME

    Plack::App::GitHubPages::Faux - PSGI app to test your GitHub Pages site

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Plack::App::GitHubPages::Faux;
     
     my $app = Plack::App::File->new( root => "/path/to/htdocs" )->to_app;

DESCRIPTION

    This is a static file server PSGI application with some tweaks to
    operate similar to a GitHub Pages website so that you can do some
    testing to see if your site looks right before committing. It could
    also be useful in unit tests for your static site. It is a pretty
    simple minded subclass of Plack::App::File with these feature
    additions:

    serve index.html files for directory indexes

      If a request is made against a directory with an index.html file,
      that index will be served as a response.

    redirect to directory url with trailing /

      This is important to get the right relative URLs in your indexes.

    serve 404.html for not found

      You can customize your 404 response on GitHub pages by putting a
      404.html in the document root. This module will serve that for 404s
      so that you can see the 404s the way they will be displayed on GitHub
      pages.
