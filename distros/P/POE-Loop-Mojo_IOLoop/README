NAME

    POE::Loop::Mojo_IOLoop - a bridge that allows POE to be driven by
    Mojo::IOLoop

SYNOPSIS

    See POE::Loop.

     use POE qw(Loop::Mojo_IOLoop);
     
     use POE::Kernel { loop => 'Mojo::IOLoop' };
     
     BEGIN { $ENV{POE_EVENT_LOOP} = 'POE::Loop::Mojo_IOLoop' }
     use POE;

DESCRIPTION

    POE::Loop::Mojo_IOLoop implements the interface documented in
    POE::Loop. Therefore it has no documentation of its own. Please see
    POE::Loop for more details.

    When using Mojo::IOLoop with POE, the loop must be set explicitly or
    POE will detect multiple event loops and fail. You can set the event
    loop by setting the environment variable POE_EVENT_LOOP to
    POE::Loop::Mojo_IOLoop before POE is loaded, or by including it in the
    use directive when initially loading POE. See "Using POE with Other
    Event Loops" in POE::Kernel for more information.
