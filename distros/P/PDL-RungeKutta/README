NAME

	PDL::RungeKutta - Solve N-th order M dimensional ordinary differential 
	equations using adaptive stepsize Runge Kutta method.

DESCRIPTION

	This module allows to solve N-th order M dimensional ordinary
	differential  equations. It uses the  adaptive stepsize control for
	fifth order Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta  algorithm described in  "Numerical
	Recipes in Fortran 77: The Art of Scientific Computing" Ch. 16.2 The
	errors are estimated as the difference between fifth order results and
	the embeded forth order results. To solve N-th order equations, you
	must first turn it into a system of N first order equations.
