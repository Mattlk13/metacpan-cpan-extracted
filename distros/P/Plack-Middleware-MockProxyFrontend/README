Plack::Middleware::MockProxyFrontend

This middleware implements the HTTP proxy protocolâ€¦ without the proxy: it
passes every request down to the wrapped PSGI application. Your
application becomes the browser's entire internet: no matter which
address you navigate to, the response comes from the wrapped PSGI
application.

This is useful in the development of PSGI applications that do virtual
hosting, i.e. dispatching on hostname. Instead of testing your
application by going to "http://localhost:5000/", you go to
"https://example.com/" (or whatever your site is). Your application will
see a request for "https://example.com/", not "http://localhost:5000/",
e.g. when your framework generates absolute links. And then when the page
loads, the browser will think it is showing you the real
"https://example.com/", e.g. in the address bar.

The way this works is that instead of typing "http://localhost:5000/"
into the browser's address bar to test your app (or wherever your
development server is listening), you put "localhost:5000" as the
HTTP/HTTPS proxy in the browser's configuration. Then *any* URL you
navigate to will end up being served by your application, so e.g.
absolute links to "https://example.com/" will just work.
