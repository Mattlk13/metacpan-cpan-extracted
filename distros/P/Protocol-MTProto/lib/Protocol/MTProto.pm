=head1 NAME

C<Protocol::MTProto> - Helper functions for MTProto

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution is very-much a work-in-progress. Right now it simply
contains a TL schema parser, but the hope is that it will eventually contain
a full implementation of TL and MTProto, sufficient to create a Perl Telegram
client.
