NAME

    Protocol::MTProto - Helper functions for MTProto

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution is very-much a work-in-progress. Right now it simply
    contains a TL schema parser, but the hope is that it will eventually
    contain a full implementation of TL and MTProto, sufficient to create a
    Perl Telegram client.
