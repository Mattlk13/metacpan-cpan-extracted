=head1 NAME

peri-eg-read-file - peri-eg-read-file

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.07 of peri-eg-read-file (from Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-Bin-Classic), released on 2015-09-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % peri-eg-read-file [options] <path>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function demonstrate output streaming of bytes.

To do output streaming, on the function side, you just return a coderef which
can be called by caller (e.g. CLI framework C<Perinci::CmdLine>) to read data
from. Code must return data or undef to signify exhaustion.

This works over remote (HTTP) too, because output streaming is supported by
C<Riap::HTTP> (version 1.2) and C<Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client>. Streams are
translated into HTTP chunks.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C peri-eg-read-file peri-eg-read-file

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete peri-eg-read-file 'p/*/`peri-eg-read-file`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 PERI_EG_READ_FILE => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/peri-eg-read-file.conf>, C<~/peri-eg-read-file.conf> or C</etc/peri-eg-read-file.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 format (see --format)
 format_options (see --format-options)
 path (see --path)

=head1 FILES

~/.config/peri-eg-read-file.conf

~/peri-eg-read-file.conf

/etc/peri-eg-read-file.conf
