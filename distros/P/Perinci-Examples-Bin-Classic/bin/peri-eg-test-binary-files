=head1 NAME

peri-eg-test-binary-files - Accept and send binary data

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.07 of peri-eg-test-binary-files (from Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-Bin-Classic), released on 2015-09-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % peri-eg-test-binary-files [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function sets its argument's schema type as C<buf> which indicates the
argument accepts binary data. Likewise it also sets its result's schema type as
C<buf> which says that function will return binary data.

The function just returns its argument.

Note that since the metadata also contains null ("\0") in the C<default> property
of the argument specification, the metadata is also not JSON-safe.

To pass binary data over JSON/Riap, you can use Riap version 1.2 and encode the
argument with ":base64" suffix, e.g.:

 $res = Perinci::Access->new->request(
     call => "http://example.com/api/Perinci/Examples/test_binary",
     {v=>1.2, args=>{"data:base64"=>"/wA="}}); # send "\xff\0"

Without C<< v=E<gt>1.2 >>, encoded argument won't be decoded by the server.

To pass binary data on the command-line, you can use C<--ARG-base64> if the
command-line library provides it.

To receive binary result over JSON/Riap, you can use Riap version 1.2 which will
automatically encode binary data with base64 so it is safe when transformed as
JSON. The client library will also decode the encoded result back to the
original, so the whole process is transparent to you:

 $res = Perinci::Access->new->request(
     call => "http://example.com/api/Perinci/Examples/test_binary",
     {v=>1.2}); # => [200,"OK","\0\0\0",{}]

=head1 OPTIONS

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Equivalent to --format=json-pretty.

=back

=head2 Other options

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C peri-eg-test-binary-files peri-eg-test-binary-files

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete peri-eg-test-binary-files 'p/*/`peri-eg-test-binary-files`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 PERI_EG_TEST_BINARY_FILES => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/peri-eg-test-binary-files.conf>, C<~/peri-eg-test-binary-files.conf> or C</etc/peri-eg-test-binary-files.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 data (see --data)
 format (see --format)
 format_options (see --format-options)

=head1 FILES

~/.config/peri-eg-test-binary-files.conf

~/peri-eg-test-binary-files.conf

/etc/peri-eg-test-binary-files.conf
