NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::POD - Generate POD for Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI
    script

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.038 of Perinci::CmdLine::POD (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-POD), released on 2022-10-27.

SYNOPSIS
    Please see the included CLI script gen-pod-for-pericmd-script.

FUNCTIONS
  gen_pod_for_pericmd_script
    Usage:

     gen_pod_for_pericmd_script(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate POD for Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI script.

    This utility can accept either a path to a Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI
    script, upon which the arguments to Perinci::CmdLine constructor will be
    extracted using a script dumper (Perinci::CmdLine::Dump), or a set of
    arguments to specify Perinci::CmdLine constructor arguments directly
    (e.g. "url", "summary", "subcommands", etc).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   common_opts => *hash*

        Set `common_opts` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   completer_script => *str*

        Script name for shell completion.

        A special value of ":self" means this script can complete itself.

        Without specifying this option, the COMPLETION POD section will not
        be generated.

    *   config_dirs => *array[dirname]*

        Set `config_dirs` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   config_filename => *str|array[str]|array[hash]*

        Set `config_filename` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   default_subcommand => *str*

        Set `default_subcommand` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   env_name => *str*

        Set `env_name` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   gen_subcommand => *str*

        Only generate POD for this subcommand.

        See "--gen-subcommands".

    *   gen_subcommands => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to generate POD for subcommands.

        If you want to generate separate POD/manpage for each subcommand,
        you can use this option for the main CLI POD, then generate each
        subcommand's POD with the "--gen-subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME" option.

    *   libs => *array[dirname]*

        Extra libraries to pass to perl via -I.

    *   per_arg_json => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set `per_arg_json` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   per_arg_yaml => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set `per_arg_yaml` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   program_name => *str*

        Set `program_name` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   read_config => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set `read_config` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   read_env => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set `read_env` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   script => *filename*

        Path to script.

    *   subcommands => *hash*

        Set `subcommands` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   summary => *str*

        Set `summary` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base.

    *   url => *str*

        Set `url` attribute, see Perinci::CmdLine::Base for more details.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
