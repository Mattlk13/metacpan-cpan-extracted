NAME

    Perl::Critic::RENEEB - A collection of handy Perl::Critic policies

VERSION

    version 2.02

SYNOPSIS

    Perl::Critic::RENEEB is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that is
    used in my programming environment

DESCRIPTION

    The rules included with the Perl::Critic::RENEEB group include:

 Perl::Critic::Policy::RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormattingExceptForSplit

    I use split with regular expressions regularly, but I don't want to use
    the x-modifier there. So I wrote this policy to check all regular
    expressions in my programs but those used as a parameter to split.

 Perl::Critic::Policy::Reneeb::ProhibitBlockEval

    Use try{...} from Try::Tiny <https://metacpan.org/pod/Try::Tiny>
    instead of eval{...}.

 Perl::Critic::Policy::Reneeb::Capitalization

    Checks for capitalization of package names, subroutines, etc. It's a
    subclass of Perl::Critic::Policy::NamingConventions::Capitalization,
    but it adds the parameter full_qualified_package_exemptions to exclude
    packages by "full qualified namespace".

        full_qualified_package_exemptions = Test::Command::.*

    excludes all packages in the Test::Command:: namespace from the check.
