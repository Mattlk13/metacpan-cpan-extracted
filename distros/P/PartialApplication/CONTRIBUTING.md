# Contributing to the PartialApplication module

If you'd like to contribute to the PartialApplication module then I suggest you
use one of the following ways:

* Post a ticket to the [RT](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=PartialApplication)
queue for the module.

* Raise an issue in the [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/scrapheap/partialApplication/issues)

* If you have actual code to commit then make a Merge Request to the [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/scrapheap/partialApplication)
