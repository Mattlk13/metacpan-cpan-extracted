NAME
    Pod::Definitions -- extract main sections and contained definitions from
    Pod

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        my $pod_file = Pod::Definitions->new();
        $pod_file->parse_file($file_name);

DESCRIPTION
    This class uses Pod::Headings to parse a Pod file and extract the
    top-level (head1) headings, and the names of the functions, methods,
    events, or such as documented therein.

    Heading names, presumed to be written in the English language, are
    simplifed for indexing purposes. (See Pod::Headings::Heuristic for
    details.) For example:

        What is the Q function?               -> Q function
        How can I blip the blop?              -> Blip the blop
        Why doesn't my socket have a packet?  -> Socket have a packet
        Where are the pockets on the port?    -> Pockets on the port
        I need to reap the zombie             -> Reap the zombie
        What does the error "Disk full" mean? -> Disk full
        What about backwards compatibility?   -> Backwards compatibility
        Reaping the zombie from proctab       -> Zombie, reaping from proctab
        $c = Mojo::Path->new()                -> new

    Currently, captialization (other than rewrites of type type shown above)
    is mostly left for the caller to handle.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new object of type Pod::Definitions

  parse_file ($filename)
    Parse a podfile, or Perl source file. Returns the Pod::Headings object,
    which, as a subclass of Pod::Simple, may give various useful information
    about the parsed document (e.g., the line_count() or pod_para_count()
    methods, or the source_dead() method which will be true if the
    Pod::Simple parser successfully read, and came to the end of, a
    document).

  file
    Local path to file as passed to parse_file

  manpage
    Full name of manpage (e.g., 'Mojo::Path').

  module
    Module leaf name (e.g., 'Path')

  sections
    Hash (with the key being the toplevel section, e.g., "FUNCTIONS") of
    arrays of section names, or undef if no sections (other than the
    standard NAME and SEE ALSO) were given in the Pod file

SEE ALSO
    Pod::Simple, Pod::Headings
