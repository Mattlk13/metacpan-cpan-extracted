NAME
    Pod::Definitions -- extract main sections and contained definitions from
    Pod

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        my $pod_file = Pod::Definitions->new();
        $pod_file->parse_file($file_name);

DESCRIPTION
    This class uses Pod::Headings to parse a Pod file and extract the
    top-level (head1) headings, and the names of the functions, methods,
    events, or such as documented therein.

    Heading names, presumed to be written in the English language, are
    simplifed for indexing purposes. (See Pod::Definitions::Heuristic for
    details.)

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new object of type Pod::Definitions

  parse_file
    Parse a podfile, or Perl source file. Returns the Pod::Headings object,
    which, as a subclass of Pod::Simple, may give various useful information
    about the parsed document (e.g., the line_count() or pod_para_count()
    methods, or the source_dead() method which will be true if the
    Pod::Simple parser successfully read, and came to the end of, a
    document).

  file
    Local path to file as passed to parse_file

  manpage
    Full name of manpage (e.g., 'Mojo::Path').

  module
    Module leaf name (e.g., 'Path')

  sections
    Hash (with the key being the toplevel section, e.g., "FUNCTIONS") of
    arrays of section information hashes. If no sections (other than the
    standard NAME and SEE ALSO) were given in the Pod file, "sections" will
    be undef.

    Section information hashes contain the following:

    raw The text of the heading as it occurs in the source file

    cooked
        The 'cleaned' text of the heading, from Pod::Definitions::Heuristic

    sequence
        The sequential number of the heading, from Pod::Headings

    link
        The "manpage" value of the file

    link_fragment
        The heading text, converted to an href compatible with metacpan and
        other displays.

SEE ALSO
    Pod::Simple, Pod::Headings, Pod::Definitions::Heuristic
