Revision history for Perl module Promise::ES6

0.17 Sun 5 Jan 2020
- Optimization: remove extra call to isa(), and use $self rather than $_[0].
  (Thank you, bdraco!)

0.16 Tue 31 Dec 2019
- Optimization: reuse coderefs in all() and race().

0.15 Thu 19 Dec 2019
- BUG FIX: Make all() ignore rejections after the first one.
- Promise::ES6’s internal representation has changed to reduce memory usage.
  Any code that may depend on the former internals will likely be broken.
- Speed up implementation.
- Clarify intent when an executor function $resolve_cr is passed a promise.
- Make Mojo subclass require a sufficiently modern Mojo::IOLoop.
- Update Future.pm docs a bit.
- Refactor implementation to prepare for XS backend.

0.14 Wed 27 Nov 2019
- Fix test by requiring a reasonably recent Test::More.

0.13 Tue 26 Nov 2019
- Provide Future conversion logic.
- Flesh out Mojo.pm documentation.

0.12 Thu 21 Nov 2019
- Fix event-loop logic to run ->then() asynchronously.
- Remove left-in Data::Dumper.
- Add Mojolicious backend.

0.11 Fri 15 Nov 2019
- Fix memory leak in callback propagation.

0.10 Thu 14 Nov 2019
- Fix ::AnyEvent and ::IOAsync to pass values to callbacks.

0.09 Thu 14 Nov 2019
- Update documentation with discussions of synchronous operation and
  cancellation.
- Add Promise::ES6::AnyEvent and Promise::ES6::IOAsync to implement
  Promises/A+ support. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Fix warnings in tests on old Perl versions.

0.08 Sun 22 Sep 2019
- Fix memory leaks in pre-5.18 perls, and proactively delete internal
  references.
- Update documentation about memory leaks.

0.07 Tue 17 Sep 2019
- Fix a number of memory leaks. (This necessitated some significant
  changes underneath.)
- Fix spurious unhandled-rejection warnings. These now happen at DESTROY
  time rather than right away. (I consider this too subtle of a change to
  be “breaking”.)
- Add more tests.

0.06 Thu 12 Sep 2019
- Issue #2: Make all() resolve when given an empty array reference.

0.05 Wed 31 Jul 2019
- Issue #1: Prevent warn() when creating a pre-rejected promise.

0.04 Mon 4 Mar 2019
- Fix missing test dependency. (doh!)

0.03 Sat 2 Mar 2019
- warn() on unhandled promise rejection.

0.02 Wed 13 Feb 2019
- Make tests Windows-compatible. (cf. RT #128491)
  No production changes.

0.01 Mon 11 Feb 2019
- Initial release
