NAME
    PerlX::Define - cute syntax for defining constants

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.12;
       use strict;
       use warnings;
   
       package MyMaths {
          use PerlX::Define;
          define PI = 3.2;
       }

DESCRIPTION
    PerlX::Define is a yet another module for defining constants.

    Differences from constant.pm:

    *   Cute syntax.

        Like constant.pm, constants get defined at compile time, not run time.

    *   Requires Perl 5.12 or above.

        If you're lucky enough to be able to free yourself from the shackles
        of supporting decade-old versions of Perl, PerlX::Define is your
        friend.

    *   Only supports scalar constants.

        List constants are rarely useful.

        Your constant can of course be a reference to an array or hash, but
        this module doesn't attempt to make the referred-to structure read
        only.

    *   Doesn't try to handle some of the things constant.pm does like
        declaring constants using fully-qualified names, or defining constants
        pointing at magic scalars.

    Prior to version 0.100, PerlX::Define was bundled with Moops.
