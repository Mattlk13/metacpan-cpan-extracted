NAME
    Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitLvalueMethods - Prohibit
    Methods being used as lvalues

SYNOPSIS
    In .perlcriticrc:

      [Subroutines::ProhibitLvalueMethods]

DESCRIPTION
    Use of methods as lvalues is uncommon. For less experienced Perl
    authors, or author primarily experienced in other languages, lvalue
    methods can be confusing or can get used accidentally.

    This policy blocks lvalue calls to methods. It does not block declaring
    a method as lvalue.
