=head1 NAME

PangoConst - the Pango constants without Glib / Gtk2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PangoConst;
    use Pango;
    # Don't need Gtk2 at all.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module copies the PANGO_* constants from L<Gtk2::Pango> so that
you can use them without having to import/install the whole of Glib
and Gtk2.

Don't ask me what the PANGO_* constants are doing in Gtk2 rather than
in L<Pango> itself. A quote from Gtk2::Pango's documentation: "This
module shouldn't exist".

=head2 Request

If you'd like to see this module continued, let me know that you're
using it. For example, send an email, write a bug report, star the
project's github repository, add a patch, add a C<++> on Metacpan.org,
or write a rating at CPAN ratings. It really does make a
difference. Thanks.
