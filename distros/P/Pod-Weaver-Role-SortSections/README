SYNOPSIS

    In your Pod::Weaver plugin:

     $self->sort_sections($document, [
         'NAME',
         'VERSION',
         'DESCRIPTION',
         qr/.+/, # put everything else here
    
         'AUTHOR',
         'COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE',
         'COPYRIGHT', # sometimes C&L is separated
         'LICENSE',   # sometimes C&L is separated
    
         'SEE ALSO',
     ]);

DESCRIPTION

    As we add sections to document using various plugins or section
    modules, sometimes in different orders, the result is that the order of
    sections might not be like we want. This role provides a
    sort_sections() to rectify that. This should be done after all section
    adding.

METHODS

 $obj->sort_sections($document, $spec)

    Sort POD sections. $spec is a list of section names or regexes as
    specified in Sort::BySpec.
