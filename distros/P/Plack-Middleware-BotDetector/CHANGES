commit 37108adfc10d47515a50530352c520d84a0db3f3
Author: chromatic <chromatic@wgz.org>
Date:   Sat Sep 17 11:21:40 2016 -0700

    Added a couple more tiny optimizations.
    
    Again, if this module did anything more than it does, they probably
    wouldn't be worth it.

    Added minor optimizations.
    
    These are very, very small -- but this is middleware, so even the modest
    expense can add up over time. Given that this is essentially one
    effective line of code, the balance seems appropriate.
