SYNOPSIS

    In your weaver.ini:

     [Changes]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin inserts Changes entries to POD section CHANGES. I used to
    think this is a good idea because I can look at the module's Changes
    history right from the POD. I've since repented :-)

    Changes is parsed using CPAN::Changes and markup in text entries are
    currently assumed to be POD too.
