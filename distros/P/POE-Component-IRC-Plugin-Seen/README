POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-Seen version 0.001002
==============================================

POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Seen is a PoCo-IRC plugin that remembers
what each person around it did last. It remembers public messages,
joins and parts.

When somebody sends him a private message of the form 'seen NICKNAME'
or somebody says 'seen NICKNAME' or 'botnick: seen NICKNAME' in a
channel with the bot, the plugin answers with the last action NICKNAME
did. There can be an exclamation mark before the word 'seen'.
