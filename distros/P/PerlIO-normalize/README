NAME

    PerlIO::normalize - PerlIO layer to normalize unicode strings on input
    and output

VERSION

    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

     # also enables UTF-8 decoding/encoding
     open my $fh, '<:encoding(UTF-8):normalize(NFD)', $file
       or die "Could not open $file for reading: $!";
     binmode STDOUT, ':normalize(NFC):encoding(UTF-8)';

DESCRIPTION

    This PerlIO layer uses Unicode::Normalize to normalize the text read
    from or written to a file-handle according to Unicode rules. It
    supports the following normalization forms: NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD, FCC,
    and FCD. It expects to recieve already-decoded unicode characters, so
    you should make sure to put the correct encoding layer ahead of it if
    reading, and behind it if writing, as per the SYNOPSIS.
