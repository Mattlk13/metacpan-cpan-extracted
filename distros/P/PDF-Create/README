NAME

PDF::Create - create PDF files

DESCRIPTION

PDF::Create allows you to create PDF documents using a large number of primitives
and emit the result as a PDF file/stream.PDF stands for Portable Document Format.

Documents  can have several pages, a table of content, an information section and
many other PDF elements. More functionnalities will be added as needs arise.

Documents are  constructed on  the fly so the memory footprint is not tied to the
size of the pages but only to their number.

It's main advantage over the other PDF modules is that it doesn't depend on other
modules and is perl only (no compiler needed).

If you want a  quick  and dirty way of creating pdf's, PDF::Create is for you. If
you  need  a complete Framework to create complex PDF stuff, you better dive into
the PDF::API2 based modules.

More information about this module is included in this package.

SYNOPSIS

    use strict; use warnings;
    use PDF::Create;

    my $pdf = PDF::Create->new(
        'filename'     => 'sample.pdf',
        'Author'       => 'John Doe',
        'Title'        => 'Sample PDF',
        'CreationDate' => [ localtime ]
    );

    # add a A4 sized page
    my $a4 = $pdf->new_page('MediaBox' => $pdf->get_page_size('A4'));

    # Add a page which inherits its attributes from $a4
    my $page = $a4->new_page;

    # Prepare a font
    my $f1 = $pdf->font('BaseFont' => 'Helvetica');

    # Prepare a Table of Content
    my $toc = $pdf->new_outline('Title' => 'Title Page', 'Destination' => $page);

    # Write some text
    $page->stringc($f1, 40, 306, 426, "PDF::Create");
    $page->stringc($f1, 20, 306, 396, "version $PDF::Create::VERSION");
    $page->stringc($f1, 20, 306, 300, 'by John Doe <john.doe@example.com>');

    # Add another page
    my $page2 = $a4->new_page;

    # Draw some lines
    $page2->line(0, 0, 612, 792);
    $page2->line(0, 792, 612, 0);

    $toc->new_outline('Title' => 'Second Page', 'Destination' => $page2);

    # Close the file and write the PDF
    $pdf->close;

INSTALLATION

Quick answer:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install PDF::Create'

Long answer:

To install manually, cd to the directory containing the unpacked distribution and
do one of the following:

a) Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL  using  the  perl  program into whose
library you want to install and then run make three times:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

b) To install into a private library, for example your home directory:

   perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=$HOME/lib INSTALLMAN3DIR=$HOME/man
   make
   make test
   make pure_install
