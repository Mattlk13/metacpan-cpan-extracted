Revision history for PDF::Create

1.42  2017-04-11 12:15:00 MANWAR
      - Assigned filehandle encoding to 'utf8' explicitly.
      - Assigned default font width.

1.41  2016-12-29 15:10:00 MANWAR
      - Proposed fix for RT #119292 and rollbacked patch for RT #118764.

      Document how close() deals when <filename> or <fh> is involved.
      i.e. When <fh> is provided then don't try to close the file handle
      at the end. Leave that for the end user to deal with it outside.
      Added new method flush() that does exactly this.
