NAME
    Path::Util - Path functions

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.000002 of Path::Util (from Perl
    distribution Path-Util), released on 2021-07-05.

SYNOPSIS
     use Path::Util qw(
         basename
     );

     # basename
     $filename = basename("/home/ujang/foo.txt"); # => "foo.txt"
     $dirname  = basename("../etc/mysql/"); # => "foo.txt"

DESCRIPTION
    VERY EARLY RELEASE, ONLY A TINY BIT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

    Following Perl's "easy things should be easy" motto, the goal of this
    module is to make many path-related tasks as simple as calling a single
    function. The functions in this module are usually wrappers for
    functions of other modules or methods of other classes. You can think of
    this module as the "List::Util for path" or "a non-OO Path::Tiny".

FUNCTIONS
  basename
    Usage:

     my $file = basename($path);

    Examples:

    This function returns the file portion or last directory portion of a
    path. It uses File::Spec's "splitpath" and grabs the last returned
    element, optionally does something extra (see below).

    Given a list of suffixes as strings or regular expressions, any that
    matches at the end of the file portion or last directory portion will be
    removed before the result is returned.

    Similar to Path::Tiny's "basename".

    See also: File::Basename.

    Available since v0.000001.
