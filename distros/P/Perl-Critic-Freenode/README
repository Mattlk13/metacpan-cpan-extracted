NAME

    Perl::Critic::Freenode - Community-inspired Perl::Critic policies
    (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS

      $ perlcritic --theme freenode script.pl
      $ perlcritic --theme freenode lib/
      
      # .perlcriticrc
      theme = freenode

DESCRIPTION

    Legacy alias for the Perl::Critic::Community policy set. Contains all
    of the same policies but under the Freenode:: policy namespace and
    freenode theme.

AFFILIATION

    This module has no functionality, but instead contains documentation
    for this distribution and acts as a means of pulling other modules into
    a bundle. All of the Policy modules contained herein will have an
    "AFFILIATION" section announcing their participation in this grouping.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

    All policies included are in the "freenode" theme. See the Perl::Critic
    documentation for how to make use of this.
