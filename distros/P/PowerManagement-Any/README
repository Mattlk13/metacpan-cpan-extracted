NAME
    PowerManagement::Any - Common interface to some power management tasks

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of PowerManagement::Any (from Perl
    distribution PowerManagement-Any), released on 2019-05-22.

NOTES
FUNCTIONS
  prevent_sleep
    Usage:

     prevent_sleep() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Prevent system from sleeping.

    Will also prevent system from hybrid sleeping, suspending, or
    hibernating. The effect is permanent; you need to "unprevent_sleep()" to
    reverse the effect.

    Note that this does not prevent screen blanking or locking (screensaver
    activating); see Screensaver::Any for routines that disable screensaver.

    On systems that run Systemd, this is implemented by masking the
    sleep.target. It automatically also prevents suspend.target,
    hybrid-sleep.target, and hibernate.target from activating.

    Not implemented yet for other systems. Patches welcome.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  sleep_is_prevented
    Usage:

     sleep_is_prevented() -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Check if sleep has been prevented.

    See "prevent_sleep()" for more details.
