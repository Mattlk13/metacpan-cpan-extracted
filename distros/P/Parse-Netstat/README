NAME
    Parse::Netstat - Parse the output of "netstat" command

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.150 of Parse::Netstat (from Perl
    distribution Parse-Netstat), released on 2022-12-04.

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Netstat qw(parse_netstat);
     my $res = parse_netstat(output => join("", `netstat -anp`), flavor=>'linux');

FUNCTIONS
  parse_netstat
    Usage:

     parse_netstat(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Parse the output of "netstat" command.

    This utility support several flavors of netstat. The default flavor is
    "linux". Use "--flavor" to select which flavor you want.

    Since different flavors provide different fields and same-named fields
    might contain data in different format, and also not all kinds of
    possible output from a single flavor are supported, please see the
    sample parse output for each flavor (in corresponding
    "Parse::Netstat::*" per-flavor module) you want to use and adjust
    accordingly.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   flavor => *str* (default: "linux")

        Flavor of netstat.

    *   output* => *str*

        Output of netstat command.

        This utility only parses program's output. You need to invoke
        "netstat" on your own.

    *   tcp => *bool* (default: 1)

        Parse TCP connections.

    *   udp => *bool* (default: 1)

        Parse UDP connections.

    *   unix => *bool* (default: 1)

        Parse Unix socket connections.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
