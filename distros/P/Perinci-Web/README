SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

    Perinci::Web is a web application framework. It will let you define
    routes to your functions (accessed via Riap protocol), templating,
    assets, etc. The spirit is much like Perinci::CmdLine: to let you write
    as much core functionality in normal Perl functions equipped with
    metadata rich enough to make converting/using them in a web application
    to be as easy as possible.

    It is not implemented yet.

ATTRIBUTES

METHODS

 $pweb = Perinci::Web->new(%opts)

    Create an instance.

 $pweb->app() -> CODE

    Generate a PSGI application. You can then deploy your web application
    using any PSGI web server.

FAQ

 How does Perinci::Web compare with other web application frameworks?

    The main difference is that Perinci::Web accesses your code through
    Riap protocol, not directly. This means that aside from local Perl
    code, Perinci::Web can also provide web application interface for code
    in remote hosts/languages.

    Aside from this difference, there are several others: XXX

 How do I provide HTTP API for my web application?

    This is one of the reasons why the Riap (specifically, Riap::HTTP)
    protocol was created. You can easily provide API access to your
    functions using Perinci::Access::HTTP::Server.

    Perinci::CmdLine. This is a command-line application framework and not
    a web application framework, but Perinci::Web is created in the same
    spirit as this module.
