NAME

    Parse::Man - parse nroff-formatted manpages

DESCRIPTION

    This abstract subclass of Parser::MGC recognises nroff grammar from a
    file or string value. It invokes methods when various nroff directives
    are encountered. It is intended that this class be used as a base
    class, with methods provided to handle the various directives and
    formatting options. Typically a subclass will store intermediate
    results in a data structure, building it as directed by these method
    invocations.

TEXT CHUNK FORMATTING METHOD

    The following method is used to handle formatted text. Each call is
    passed a plain string value from the input content.

 chunk

       $parser->chunk( $text, %opts )

    The %opts hash contains the following options:

    font => STRING

      The name of the current font (R, B, etc..)

    size => INT

      The current text size, relative to a paragraph base of 0.

    Other font requests that are found in \fX or \f(AB requests are handled
    by similarly-named methods.

PARAGRAPH HANDLING METHODS

    The following methods are used to form paragraphs out of formatted text
    chunks. Their return values are ignored.

 para_TH

       $parser->para_TH( $name, $section )

    Handles the .TH paragraph which gives the page title and section
    number.

 para_SH

       $parser->para_SH( $title )

    Handles the .SH paragraph, which gives a section header.

 para_SS

       $parser->para_SS( $title )

    Handles the .SS paragraph, which gives a sub-section header.

 para_TP

       $parser->para_TP( $opts )

    Handles a .TP paragraph, which gives a term definition.

 para_IP

       $parser->para_IP( $opts )

    Handles a .IP paragraph, which is indented like the definition part of
    a .TP paragraph.

 para_P

       $parser->para_P( $opts )

    Handles the .P, .PP or .LP paragraphs, which are all synonyms for a
    plain paragraph content.

 para_EX

       $parser->para_EX( $opts )

    Handles the .EX paragraph, which is example text; intended to be
    rendered in a fixed-width font without filling.
