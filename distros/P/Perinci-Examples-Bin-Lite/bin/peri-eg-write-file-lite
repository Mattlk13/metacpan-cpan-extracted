=head1 NAME

peri-eg-write-file-lite - peri-eg-write-file-lite

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.05 of peri-eg-write-file-lite (from Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-Bin-Lite), released on 2015-09-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % peri-eg-write-file-lite [options] <path> <content>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function demonstrates input streaming of bytes.

To do input streaming, on the function side, you just specify one your args with
the C<stream> property set to true (C<< stream =E<gt> 1 >>). In this example, the
C<content> argument is set to streaming.

If you run the function through C<Perinci::CmdLine>, you'll get a coderef instead
of the actual value. You can then repeatedly call the code to read data. This
currently works for local functions only. As of this writing, C<Riap::HTTP>
protocol does not support input streaming. It supports partial input though (see
the documentation on how this works) and theoretically streaming can be emulated
by client library using partial input. However, client like
C<Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client> does not yet support this.

Note that the argument's schema is still C<buf*>, not C<code*>.

Note: This function overwrites existing file.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--content-base64>=I<s>

See C<--content>.

=item B<--content>=I<s>*

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--path>=I<s>*

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C peri-eg-write-file-lite peri-eg-write-file-lite

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete peri-eg-write-file-lite 'p/*/`peri-eg-write-file-lite`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 PERI_EG_WRITE_FILE_LITE_OPT => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/peri-eg-write-file-lite.conf>, C<~/peri-eg-write-file-lite.conf> or C</etc/peri-eg-write-file-lite.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 content (see --content)
 format (see --format)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)
 path (see --path)

=head1 FILES

~/.config/peri-eg-write-file-lite.conf

~/peri-eg-write-file-lite.conf

/etc/peri-eg-write-file-lite.conf
