SYNOPSIS

     # in app.psgi
     use Plack::Builder;
    
     builder {
        enable 'AccessLog::Structured',
           extra_field => {
             'pt.cpu-user' => 'CPU-User-Time',
             'pt.cpu-sys'  => 'CPU-Sys-Time',
           };
    
        enable 'ProcessTimes';
    
        $app
     };

DESCRIPTION

    Plack::Middleware::ProcessTimes defines some environment values based
    on the "times" in perlfunc function. The following values are defined:

      * pt.real - Actual recorded wallclock time

      * pt.cpu-user

      * pt.cpu-sys

      * pt.cpu-cuser

      * pt.cpu-csys

    Look up times(2) in your system manual for what these all mean.

CONFIGURATION

 measure_children

    Setting measure_children to true will "waitpid" in perlfunc for
    children so that child times can be measured. If set responses will be
    somewhat slower; if not set, the headers will be set to -.
