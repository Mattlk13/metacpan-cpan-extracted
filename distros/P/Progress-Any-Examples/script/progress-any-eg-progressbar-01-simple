=head1 NAME

progress-any-eg-progressbar-01-simple - A simple progress bar on the terminal

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of progress-any-eg-progressbar-01-simple (from Perl distribution Progress-Any-Examples), released on 2020-06-20.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % progress-any-eg-progressbar-01-simple [target=10]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example shows a simple progress bar on the terminal. The progress indicator
is updated every 0.3 second, so we set output argument C<freq> to 0.25 to be
able to reflect each update on the terminal. The default C<freq> value 0.5 would
make the progress bar miss showing some updates.
