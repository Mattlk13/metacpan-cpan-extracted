=head1 NAME

Paws::DirectConnect::CreateConnection - Arguments for method CreateConnection on L<Paws::DirectConnect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateConnection on the
L<AWS Direct Connect|Paws::DirectConnect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateConnection.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $directconnect = Paws->service('DirectConnect');
    my $Connection = $directconnect->CreateConnection(
      Bandwidth      => 'MyBandwidth',
      ConnectionName => 'MyConnectionName',
      Location       => 'MyLocationCode',
      LagId          => 'MyLagId',            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Vlan            = $Connection->Vlan;
    my $ConnectionId    = $Connection->ConnectionId;
    my $Region          = $Connection->Region;
    my $LagId           = $Connection->LagId;
    my $Bandwidth       = $Connection->Bandwidth;
    my $OwnerAccount    = $Connection->OwnerAccount;
    my $PartnerName     = $Connection->PartnerName;
    my $LoaIssueTime    = $Connection->LoaIssueTime;
    my $Location        = $Connection->Location;
    my $AwsDevice       = $Connection->AwsDevice;
    my $ConnectionState = $Connection->ConnectionState;
    my $ConnectionName  = $Connection->ConnectionName;

    # Returns a L<Paws::DirectConnect::Connection> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/directconnect/CreateConnection>
