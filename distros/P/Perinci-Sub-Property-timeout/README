SYNOPSIS

     # in function metadata
     timeout => 5,

DESCRIPTION

    This property specifies function execution time limit, in seconds. The
    default is 0, which means unlimited.

    This property's wrapper implementation uses alarm() (ualarm()
    replacement, for subsecond granularity, will be considered upon
    demand). If limit is reached, a 504 (timeout) status is returned.
