NAME
    Perinci::Sub::XCompletion - Write completion routines in
    x.{,element_,index_}completion attributes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.101 of Perinci::Sub::XCompletion (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Sub-XCompletion), released on 2019-02-24.

SYNOPSIS
    In Rinci metadata:

     args => {
         foo => {
             ...
             'x.completion' => [filename => {file_regex_filter=>qr/\.(yaml|yml)$/i}],
         },
         ...
     },
     ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a module to support an experimental (and temporary?) way to ease
    writing completion routine. Instead of putting a coderef in "completion"
    or "element_completion" property in argument specification, you put
    $name or "[$name, \%args]" in "x.completion" or "x.element_completion"
    or "x.index_completion" attributes. $name is the name of
    "Perinci::Sub::XCompletion::*" submodule to use, and \%args is
    arguments.

    But you can also use a coderef as usual.
