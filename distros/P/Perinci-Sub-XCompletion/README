SYNOPSIS

    In Rinci metadata:

     args => {
         foo => {
             ...
             'x.completion' => [filename => {file_regex_filter=>qr/\.(yaml|yml)$/i}],
         },
         ...
     },
     ...

DESCRIPTION

    This is a module to support an experimental (and temporary?) way to
    ease writing completion routine. Instead of putting a coderef in
    completion or element_completion property in argument specification,
    you put $name or [$name, \%args] in x.completion or
    x.element_completion or x.index_completion attributes. $name is the
    name of Perinci::Sub::XCompletion::* submodule to use, and \%args is
    arguments.

    But you can also use a coderef as usual.
