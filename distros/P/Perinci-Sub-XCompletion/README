NAME
    Perinci::Sub::XCompletion - Write completion routines in
    x.{,element_,index_}completion attributes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.106 of Perinci::Sub::XCompletion (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Sub-XCompletion), released on 2023-11-18.

SYNOPSIS
    In Rinci metadata:

     args => {
         foo => {
             ...
             'x.completion' => [filename => {file_regex_filter=>qr/\.(yaml|yml)$/i}],
         },
         ...
     },
     ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a module to support an experimental (and temporary?) way to ease
    writing completion routine. Instead of putting a coderef in "completion"
    or "element_completion" property in argument specification, you put
    $name or "[$name, \%args]" in "x.completion" or "x.element_completion"
    or "x.index_completion" attributes. $name is the name of
    "Perinci::Sub::XCompletion::*" submodule to use, and \%args is
    arguments.

    But you can also use a coderef as usual.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
