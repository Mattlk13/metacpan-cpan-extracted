=head1 NAME

parse-id-phone - Alias for extract_id_phones(..., max_numbers=>1)->[0]

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.16 of parse-id-phone (from Perl distribution Parse-PhoneNumber-ID), released on 2017-07-10.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % parse-id-phone [options] <text>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extracts phone number(s) from text. Return an array of one or more parsed phone
number structure (a hash). Understands the list of known area codes and cellular
operators, as well as other information. Understands various syntax e.g.
+62.22.1234567, (022) 123-4567, 022-123-4567 ext 102, and even things like
7123456/57 (2 adjacent numbers).

Extraction algorithm is particularly targetted at classified ads text in
Indonesian language, but should be quite suitable for any other normal text.

Non-Indonesian phone numbers (e.g. +65 12 3456 7890) will still be extracted,
but without any other detailed information other than country code.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--default-area-code>=I<s>

When encountering a number without area code, use this.

If you want to extract numbers that doesn't contain area code (e.g. 7123 4567),
you'll need to provide this.


=item B<--level>=I<i>

How hard should the function extract numbers (1-9).

Default value:

 5

The higher the level, the harder this function will try finding phone numbers,
but the higher the risk of false positives will be. E.g. in text
'123456789012345' with level=5 it will not find a phone number, but with level=9
it might assume, e.g. 1234567890 to be a phone number. Normally leaving level at
default level is fine.


=item B<--text>=I<s>*

Text containing phone numbers to extract from.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C parse-id-phone parse-id-phone

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete parse-id-phone 'p/*/`parse-id-phone`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/parse-id-phone.conf>, F<~/parse-id-phone.conf>, or F</etc/parse-id-phone.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

List of available configuration parameters:

 default_area_code (see --default-area-code)
 format (see --format)
 level (see --level)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)
 text (see --text)
