=head1 NAME

parse-id-phone - Alias for extract_id_phones(..., max_numbers=>1)->[0]

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.15 of parse-id-phone (from Perl distribution Parse-PhoneNumber-ID), released on 2015-09-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % parse-id-phone [options] <text>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extracts phone number(s) from text. Return an array of one or more parsed phone
number structure (a hash). Understands the list of known area codes and cellular
operators, as well as other information. Understands various syntax e.g.
+62.22.1234567, (022) 123-4567, 022-123-4567 ext 102, and even things like
7123456/57 (2 adjacent numbers).

Extraction algorithm is particularly targetted at classified ads text in
Indonesian language, but should be quite suitable for any other normal text.

Non-Indonesian phone numbers (e.g. +65 12 3456 7890) will still be extracted,
but without any other detailed information other than country code.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--default-area-code>=I<s>

When encountering a number without area code, use this.

If you want to extract numbers that doesn't contain area code (e.g. 7123 4567),
you'll need to provide this.


=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--level>=I<i>

How hard should the function extract numbers (1-9).

Default value:

 5

The higher the level, the harder this function will try finding phone numbers,
but the higher the risk of false positives will be. E.g. in text
'123456789012345' with level=5 it will not find a phone number, but with level=9
it might assume, e.g. 1234567890 to be a phone number. Normally leaving level at
default level is fine.


=item B<--text>=I<s>*

Text containing phone numbers to extract from.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C parse-id-phone parse-id-phone

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete parse-id-phone 'p/*/`parse-id-phone`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 PARSE_ID_PHONE_OPT => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/parse-id-phone.conf>, C<~/parse-id-phone.conf> or C</etc/parse-id-phone.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 default_area_code (see --default-area-code)
 format (see --format)
 level (see --level)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)
 text (see --text)
