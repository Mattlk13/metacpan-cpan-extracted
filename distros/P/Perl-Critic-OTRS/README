NAME

    Perl::Critic::OTRS - A collection of handy Perl::Critic policies

VERSION

    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS

    Perl::Critic::OTRS is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that will
    help to program in the OTRS way of programming

DESCRIPTION

    The rules included with the Perl::Critic::OTRS group include:

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitFetchrowHashref

    Kernel::System::DB provides a method called FetchrowHashref, but this
    method is deprecated as this relies on DBI's fetchrow_hashref. Some
    users have reported problems with it on some database systems.

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitDumper

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitLocaltime

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitLowPrecedenceOps

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitOpen

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitPushISA

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitRequire

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::ProhibitSomeCoreFunctions

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::RequireCamelCase

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::RequireParensWithMethods

 Perl::Critic::Policy::OTRS::RequireTrueReturnValueForModules

WHY A COLLECTION OF OTRS POLICIES?

    The policies bundled in this distributions represent the coding
    guideline provided by the OTRS project. It's always a good idea to
    program the way the project itself does.

    So every programmer who is familiar with the OTRS codebase can read and
    follow your code.
