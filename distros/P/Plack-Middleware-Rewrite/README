Plack::Middleware::Rewrite

This middleware provides a convenient way to modify requests in flight
in Plack apps. Rewrite rules are simply written in Perl, which means
everything that can be done with mod_rewrite can be done with this
middleware much more intuitively (if in syntactically wordier ways). Its
primary purpose is rewriting paths, but almost anything is possible very
easily.
