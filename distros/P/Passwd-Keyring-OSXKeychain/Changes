	#1 Reasonable chances of better support for passwords containing

    various encoded password cases, based on examples provided in the
    issue, and Switched to using -w option of find-generic-password,
    and that new password decoding algorithm.

    #2 Fixing show-keychain-info command parameters so it doesn't emit
