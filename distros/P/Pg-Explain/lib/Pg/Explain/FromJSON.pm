sub parse_source {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $source = shift;

    # We need to remove things before and/or after explain
    # To do this, first - split explain into lines...
    my @source_lines = split( /[\r\n]+/, $source );
    my $prefix = '';

    # Now, find first line of explain, and cache it's prefix (some spaces ...)
    for my $l ( @source_lines ) {
        next unless $l =~ m{\A (\s*) \[ \s* \z }x;
        $prefix = $1;

    # Now, extract lines with explain using known prefix
    my @use_lines = grep { /\A$prefix\[\s*\z/ .. /\A$prefix\]\s*\z/ } @source_lines;
    my $use_source = join( "\n", @use_lines );

    # And now parse the json...
