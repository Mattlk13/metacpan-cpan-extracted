PDK::Device::Hillstone - A module for interacting with Hillstone devices

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use PDK::Device::Hillstone;

  my $device = PDK::Device::Hillstone->new(
    host     => '192.168.1.1',
    username => 'admin',
    password => 'hillstone_password'
  );

  # Log in to the device
  $device->login();

  # Execute commands
  $device->execCommands(['show version', 'show interface']);

  # Retrieve running configuration
  my $config = $device->getConfig();

  # FTP configuration backup (Note: This method currently returns getConfig result)
  my $backup = $device->ftpConfig('ftp_server', 'hostname', 'ftp_username', 'ftp_password');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functionality to interact with Hillstone devices, including executing commands and retrieving configurations. It extends the PDK::Device::Base role and is tailored for Hillstone-specific operations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item B<prompt>

The device's default prompt, defaults to '^.*?($$(?:M|B|F)$$)?[>#]\s*$'. This pattern is designed to handle various Hillstone device prompts.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<errCodes>

Returns a list of possible error patterns for checking errors during command execution. These include patterns for incomplete commands, ambiguous commands, unrecognized keywords, syntax errors, and other common errors.

=item B<waitfor($prompt, $params)>

Waits for a specific prompt match and handles device responses interactively.

Parameters:
  - $prompt: The prompt to match (optional)
  - $params: A hash reference containing send command and other options (optional)
    - send: The command to send
    - continue: Whether to continue execution (default: false)
    - cache: Whether to cache the output (default: true)

Returns: The output of the command execution

=item B<getConfig>

Retrieves the running configuration of the device. It executes commands to set terminal width, disable screen length limitations, display the current configuration, and save the configuration.

Returns: A hash reference containing a success flag and configuration content.

=item B<ftpConfig($server, $hostname, $username, $password)>

This method is currently a placeholder and returns the result of getConfig. It does not perform an actual FTP backup.

Parameters:
  - $server: FTP server address
  - $hostname: Optional hostname
  - $username: FTP username
  - $password: FTP password

Returns: The result of getConfig method.
