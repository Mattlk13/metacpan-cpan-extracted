Plack::Middleware::Precompressed

Plack::Middleware::Precompressed is an alternative (or rather,
complement) to middlewares like Deflater, which will compress response
bodies on the fly. For dynamic resources, that behaviour is necessary,
but for static resources it is a waste: identical entities will be
compressed over and over. Instead, *Precompressed* allows you to
compress static resources once, e.g. as part of your build process, and
then serve the compressed resource in place of the uncompressed one for
compression-enabled clients.

To do so, by default it appends a ".gz" suffix to the "PATH_INFO" and
tries to serve that. If that fails, it will then try again with the
unmodified URI.

Note: this means requests for resources that are not pre-compressed will
always be dispatched *twice*. You are are advised to use either the
"match" parameter or the Conditional middleware or something of the
sort, to prevent requests from passing through this middleware
unnecessarily.
