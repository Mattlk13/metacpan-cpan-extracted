Plack::Middleware::Static::Precompressed

This middleware does HTTP content negotiation based on content encoding,
given a set of files that never change. It is meant primarily as a
complement to middlewares such as Deflater which compress each response
on the fly â€“ as is necessary for generated responses, but wasteful when
it repeats the same work for the same unchanged files over and over
again. This middleware lets you compress each static asset file just
once, e.g. as part of your build process, then at runtime just picks the
smallest one that the client can use.

If a URL is not matched, it is passed to the wrapped PSGI application.
But you can also use this middleware as a standalone PSGI application, in
which case it will return a 404 response for URLs it does not have. If
you would like to use it like this but dislike instantiating a
middleware, you can use the included dummy
Plack::App::File::Precompressed wrapper.
