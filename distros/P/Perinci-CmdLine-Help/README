NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::Help - Generate help message for
    Perinci::CmdLine-based app

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.175 of Perinci::CmdLine::Help (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-Help), released on 2022-10-19.

DESCRIPTION
    Currently used by Perinci::CmdLine::Lite and App::riap. Eventually I
    want Perinci::CmdLine to use this also (needs prettier and more
    sophisticated formatting options first though).

FUNCTIONS
  gen_help
    Usage:

     gen_help(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Generate help message for Perinci::CmdLine-based app.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   common_opts => *hash* (default: {})

        (No description)

    *   ggls_res => *array*

        Full result from gen_getopt_long_spec_from_meta().

        If you already call Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv's
        "gen_getopt_long_spec_from_meta()", you can pass the *full*
        enveloped result here, to avoid calculating twice.

    *   lang => *str*

        Will be passed to Perinci::Sub::To::CLIDocData's
        gen_cli_doc_data_from_meta().

    *   mark_different_lang => *bool*

        Will be passed to Perinci::Sub::To::CLIDocData's
        gen_cli_doc_data_from_meta().

    *   meta* => *hash*

        Function metadata.

    *   meta_is_normalized => *bool*

        (No description)

    *   per_arg_json => *bool*

        (No description)

    *   per_arg_yaml => *bool*

        (No description)

    *   program_name* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   program_summary => *str*

        (No description)

    *   subcommands => *hash*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
