NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::Help - Generate help message for
    Perinci::CmdLine-based app

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.172 of Perinci::CmdLine::Help (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-Help), released on 2020-02-06.

DESCRIPTION
    Currently used by Perinci::CmdLine::Lite and App::riap. Eventually I
    want Perinci::CmdLine to use this also (needs prettier and more
    sophisticated formatting options first though).

FUNCTIONS
  gen_help
    Usage:

     gen_help(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Generate help message for Perinci::CmdLine-based app.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   common_opts => *hash* (default: {})

    *   ggls_res => *array*

        Full result from gen_getopt_long_spec_from_meta().

        If you already call Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv's
        "gen_getopt_long_spec_from_meta()", you can pass the *full*
        enveloped result here, to avoid calculating twice.

    *   meta* => *hash*

        Function metadata.

    *   meta_is_normalized => *bool*

    *   per_arg_json => *bool*

    *   per_arg_yaml => *bool*

    *   program_name* => *str*

    *   program_summary => *str*

    *   subcommands => *hash*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
