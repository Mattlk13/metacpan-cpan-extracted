SYNOPSIS

    Without exit_on_error:

     # on successful call
     f(...); # [200, "OK"]
    
     # on non-successful call
     f(...); # [404, "Not found"]

    With exit_on_error => 1:

     # on successful call
     f(...); # [200, "OK"]
    
     # on non-successful call
     f(...); # print message "Call f() failed with 404 status: Not found" to STDERR and exits 104

    To customize what statuses are considered error: exit_on_error => {
    success_statuses => '^2..$' }.

DESCRIPTION

    This property sets so that function calls exit() when result status is
    a non-successful one. Successful statuses by default include 2xx and
    304 ('^(2..|304)$').

    Exit code is currently set to (like in Perinci::CmdLine) and might be
    customizable in the future.
