DESCRIPTION

    This is a thin base class for all Riap clients (Perinci::Access::*). It
    currently only provides check_request() which does the following:

      * perform some basic sanity checking of the Riap request hash $req

      * split request keys uri

      Split result is put in $req->{-uri_scheme}, $req->{-uri_auth},
      $req->{-uri_path}, $req->{-uri_query}, and $req->{-uri_frag}.

ATTRIBUTES

 riap_version => float (default: 1.1)

METHODS

 new(%args) => OBJ

    Constructor. Does nothing except creating a blessed hashref from %args.
    Subclasses should override this method and do additional stuffs as
    needed.

 check_request($req) => RESP|undef

    Should be called by subclasses during the early phase in request().
    Will return an enveloped error response on error, or undef on success.
