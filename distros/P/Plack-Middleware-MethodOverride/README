Plack::Middleware::MethodOverride

Writing REST
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>ful apps
is a good thing, but if you're also trying to support web browsers, it
would be nice not to be reduced to "GET" and "POST" for everything.

This middleware allows for "POST" requests that pretend to be something
else: by adding either a header named "X-HTTP-Method-Override" to the
request, or a query parameter named "x-tunneled-method" to the URI, the
client can say what method it actually meant. That is, as long as it
meant one of these:

*   GET

*   POST

*   HEAD

*   PUT

*   DELETE

*   OPTIONS

*   TRACE

*   CONNECT

*   PATCH

If so, then the "REQUEST_METHOD" in the PSGI environment will be
replaced with the client's desired value. The original request method is
always stored under the "plack.original_request_method" key.
