=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use PINE64::MCP9808;

	my $temp_sensor = PINE64::MCP9808->new(0, '0x18');
	my @reading = $temp_sensor->read_temperature(); 
	my $celsius = $reading[0];
	my $fahrenheit = $reading [1]; 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to take temperature readings with the
highly accurate MCP9808 I2C temperature sensor using a 
PINE64A+ board. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(0, 0x18)

You can optionally pass the I2C device id and the address of the
MCP9808 on the I2C bus.  The PINE64A+ I2C bus is /dev/i2c-0, and
the default I2C address for an MCP9808 is 0x18.  new() called with
no arguments will default to /dev/i2c-0 and 0x18.  

=head2 read_temperature()

Reads the ambient temperature register of the MCP9808 and returns
an array containing the reading in celsius and fahrenheit.  The
ambient temperature register is 0x05.  Bits 13-15 have to be masked
out.  Bit 12 is the sign bit.  The two's complement temperature 
reading is bits 0-11.  $reading[0] is temperature in celsius, 
$reading[1] is the reading in temperature.
