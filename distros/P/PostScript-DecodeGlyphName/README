PostScript::DecodeGlyphName

This module implements (most of) the PostScript glyph name to Unicode
codepoint conversion algorithm as described by Adobe at
<http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/unicodegn.jsp>.

To do something more than marginally useful with this module you will
need to download the Adobe Glyph List from
<http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/glyphlist.txt>.
