VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Parse::IPCommand (from Perl
    distribution Parse-IPCommand), released on 2019-02-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::IPCommand qw(
         parse_ip_addr_show
         list_network_interfaces
     );

     my $res = parse_ip_addr_show(output => scalar `ip addr show`);

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  list_network_interfaces
    Usage:

     list_network_interfaces(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List network interfaces from "ip addr show" output.

    If "output" is not specified, will run '/sbin/ip addr show' to get the
    output.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   output => *str*

        Output of command.

        This function only parses program's output. You need to invoke "ip"
        command on your own.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
