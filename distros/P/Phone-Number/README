ROUTINES
  new
    Creates a new, immutable object using any unambiguous phone number
    format.

        my $num = new Phone::Number('02002221666');
        my $num = new Phone::Number('2002221666');
        my $num = new Phone::Number('442002221666');
        my $num = new Phone::Number('+442002221666');
        my $new = new Phone::Number($num);

  formatted
    Returns the number formatted with leading 0 and spaces.

    This can be used for displaying the number in "standard" format.

  packed
    Returns the number with a leading 0 but no spaces.

    This can be useful for databases but see plain below.

  number
    Returns the number in international format starting with +.

  plain
    Returns the number in international format without the +.

    This is usually the best way to store the number onto a database.

  uk
    Returns a boolean: true if it is a valid UK number
