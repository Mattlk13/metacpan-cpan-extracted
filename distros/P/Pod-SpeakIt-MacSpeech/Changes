Revision history for Perl module Pod::Speakit::MacSpeech

0.11 - 2008-08-09
	* This is still a very early version of the module, but I'll
	make it a release version anyway

0.10_01 - 2007-11-20
	* initial release of a Pod translator that passes the text
	to a speech synthesizer. This one uses Mac::Speech, but
	this should really be a subclass.
