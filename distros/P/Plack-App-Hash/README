Plack::App::Hash

This PSGI application responds to HTTP requests by looking up the
request path in a hash and returning the value of that key (if found) as
the response body.

This is useful for cases like inlining the content of a boilerplate
static site into a single-page-application-in-a-module, or serving up a
tied DBM hash that other programs can update while the web app itself
contains very little logic â€“ in short, for one-off hacks and scaling
down.
