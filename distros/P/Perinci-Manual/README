NAME
    Perinci::Manual - Extra documentation for Perinci

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of Perinci::Manual (from Perl
    distribution Perinci-Manual), released on 2021-07-31.

DESCRIPTION
    The "Perinci" namespace contains several separate frameworks (for
    example: Perinci::Sub::Wrapper, Perinci::CmdLine), all themed around the
    Rinci and Riap specification, and each framework having its own
    documentation. This distribution contains additional, mostly
    cross-framework documentation.

    The documentation is organized around the concept of "four types of
    documentation". See <https://documentation.divio.com/> for more details.
