POSIX-Run-Capture version 0.01
==============================

POSIX::Run::Capture runs an external command and captures its output. Both
standard error and output are captured. Upon exit, their contents can be
accessed line by line or in one chunk. Callback routines can be supplied
that will be called for each complete line of output read, providing a way
for synchronous processing. Standard input can be supplied as either a
filehandle or a text.

This module is for those who value performance and effectiveness over
portability. As its name suggests, it can be used only on POSIX systems.
