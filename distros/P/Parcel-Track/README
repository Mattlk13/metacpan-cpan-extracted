NAME
    Parcel::Track - Driver-based API for tracking parcel

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
        # Create a tracker
        my $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'KR::Test', '64537-0301-2020' );

        # ID & URI
        print $tracker->id . "\n";
        print $tracker->uri . "\n";
    
        # Track the information
        my $result = $tracker->track;
    
        # Get the information what you want.
        if ( $result ) {
            print "$result->{from}\n";
            print "$result->{to}\n";
            print "$result->{result}\n";
            print "$_\n" for @{ $result->{descs} };
            print "$_\n" for @{ $result->{htmls} };
        }
        else {
            print "Failed to track information\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    "Parcel::Track" is intended to provide a driver-based single API for
    tracking parcel information. The intent is to provide a single API
    against which to write the code to track the parcel information.

    "Parcel::Track" drivers are installed seperately.

    The design of this module is almost stolen from SMS::Send.

ATTRIBUTES
  driver
    Returns loaded driver object. You can access attributes and methods of
    specific driver.

        $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'MyDriver', '123-456-789-012',
            _username => 'keedi',
            _password => 'keedi',
        );
        $tracker->driver->username; # NOT _username BUT username
        $tracker->driver->password; # NOT _password BUT password
        $tracker->driver->foo( $dummy1 );
        $tracker->driver->bar( $dummy2, $dummy3 );

METHODS
  new
        # The most basic tracker
        $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'Test', '123-456-789-012' );
    
        # Indicate regional driver with ::
        $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'KR::Test', '123-456-789-012' );
    
        # Pass arbitrary params to the driver
        $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'MyDriver', '123-456-789-012',
            _username => 'keedi',
            _password => 'keedi',
        );

    The "new" constructor creates a new Parcel tracker.

    It takes as its first parameter a driver name. These names map the class
    names. For example driver "Test" matches the testing driver
    Parcel::Track::Test.

    It takes as its second parameter a tracking number.

    Any additional params should be key/value pairs, split into two types.

    Params without a leading underscore are "public" options and relate to
    standardised features within the Parcel::Track API itself. At this time,
    there are no usable public options.

    Params with a leading underscore are "private" driver-specific options
    and will be passed through to the driver without the underscore.

        $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'MyDriver', '123-456-789-012',
            _username => 'keedi',
            _password => 'keedi',
        );
        $tracker->driver->username; # NOT _username BUT username
        $tracker->driver->password; # NOT _password BUT password

    Returns a new Parcel::Track object, or dies on error.

  id
    Returns tracking number.

  uri
    Returns official link to track parcel.

  track
    Returns "HASHREF" which contains information of tracking the parcel.

        my $tracker = Parcel::Track->new( 'KR::Test', '64537-0301-2020' );
        my $info = $tracker->track;
        print "$info->{from}\n";
        print "$info->{to}\n";
        print "$info->{result}\n";
        print "$_\n" for @{ $info->{htmls} };
        print "$_\n" for @{ $info->{descs} };

    "HASHREF" MUST contain following key and value pairs.

    *   "from": "SCALAR".

    *   "to": "SCALAR".

    *   "result": "SCALAR".

    *   "htmls": "ARRAYREF".

    *   "descs": "ARRAYREF".
