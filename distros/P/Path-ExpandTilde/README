NAME

    Path::ExpandTilde - Expand tilde (~) to homedir in file paths

SYNOPSIS

      use Path::ExpandTilde;
      my $homedir = expand_tilde('~');
      my $bashrc = expand_tilde('~/.bashrc');
      my $pg_home = expand_tilde('~postgres');

DESCRIPTION

    This module uses bsd_glob from File::Glob to portably expand a leading
    tilde (~) in a file path into the current or specified user's home
    directory. No other glob metacharacters are expanded.

FUNCTIONS

 expand_tilde

      my $new_path = expand_tilde($path);

    Exported by default. If the path starts with ~, expands that to the
    current user's home directory. If the path starts with ~username,
    expands that to the specified user's home directory. If the user
    doesn't exist, no expansion is done. The returned path is canonicalized
    as by "canonpath" in File::Spec either way.

NOTES

    The algorithm should be portable to most operating systems supported by
    Perl, though the home directory may not be found by bsd_glob on some.
