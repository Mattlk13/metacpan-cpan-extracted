NAME

    Perl::Critic::Community - Community-inspired Perl::Critic policies

SYNOPSIS

      $ perlcritic --theme community script.pl
      $ perlcritic --theme community lib/
      
      # .perlcriticrc
      theme = community
      severity = 1

DESCRIPTION

    A set of Perl::Critic policies to enforce the practices generally
    recommended by subsets of the Perl community, particularly on IRC.
    Formerly known as Perl::Critic::Freenode. Because this policy "theme"
    is designed to be used with zero configuration on the command line,
    some duplication will occur if it is used in combination with core
    Perl::Critic policies.

AFFILIATION

    This module has no functionality, but instead contains documentation
    for this distribution and acts as a means of pulling other modules into
    a bundle. All of the Policy modules contained herein will have an
    "AFFILIATION" section announcing their participation in this grouping.
