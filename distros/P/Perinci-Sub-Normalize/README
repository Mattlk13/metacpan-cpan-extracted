NAME
    Perinci::Sub::Normalize - Normalize Rinci function metadata

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.204 of Perinci::Sub::Normalize (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Sub-Normalize), released on 2022-12-09.

SYNOPSIS
     use Perinci::Sub::Normalize qw(normalize_function_metadata);

     my $nmeta = normalize_function_metadata($meta);

FUNCTIONS
  normalize_function_metadata($meta[ , \%opts ]) => HASH
    Normalize and check Rinci function metadata $meta. Return normalized
    metadata, which is a shallow copy of $meta. Die on error.

    Available options:

    *   allow_unknown_properties => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, will die if there are unknown properties.

    *   normalize_sah_schemas => BOOL (default: 1)

        By default, Sah schemas e.g. in "result/schema" or "args/*/schema"
        property is normalized using Data::Sah's "normalize_schema". Set
        this to 0 if you don't want this.

    *   remove_internal_properties => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to 1, all properties and attributes starting with underscore
        ("_") with will be stripped. According to DefHash specification,
        they are ignored and usually contain notes/comments/extra
        information.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
