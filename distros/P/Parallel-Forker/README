NAME

    Parallel::Forker README file

DESCRIPTION

    Parallel::Forker manages parallel processes that are either subroutines
    or system commands. Forker supports most of the features in all the
    other little packages out there, with the addition of being able to
    specify complicated expressions to determine which processes run after
    others, or run when others fail.
