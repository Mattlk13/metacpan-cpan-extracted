NAME

    Plack::Middleware::Zstandard - Compress response body with Zstandard

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Plack::Builder;
     
     my $app = sub {
       return [
         200,
         [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ],
         [ "Hello World!\n" ],
       ];
     };
     
     builder {
       enable 'Zstandard';
       $app;
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This middleware encodes the body of the response using Zstandard, based
    on the Accept-Encoding request header.

CONFIGURATION

    level

      Compression level. Should be an integer from 1 to 22. If not
      provided, then the default will be chosen by Compress::Stream::Zstd.

    vary

      If set to true (the default), then the response will vary on
      Content-Encoding. This is usually what you want, but if you have
      another middleware or application that is already vary'ing on that
      header, you may want to set this to false.
