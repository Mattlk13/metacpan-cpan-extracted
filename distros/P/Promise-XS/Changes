Revision history for Perl extension Promise::XS:

0.08 Mon 24 Feb 2020
- BREAKING CHANGE (minor): finally() is now closer to ECMAScript’s
  specification. Toward that end, finally() callbacks no longer receive
  arguments, and they handle exceptions and returned rejected promises as
  ECMAScript’s finally() callbacks handle them.
- A warning is now thrown if a promise is the first of multiple returns from
  a promise callback.
- Speed up memory-leak detection on promise creation.
