SYNOPSIS

    In your weaver.ini:

     [-AppendPrepend]
     ;exclude_modules = REGEX
     ;exclude_files = REGEX

    In your POD:

     =head1 prepend:FILES
    
     foo
    
     =head1 append:COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE
    
     blah blah blah

    In the final document, the text 'foo' will be prepended to the FILES
    section while 'blah blah blah' will be appended to the COPYRIGHT AND
    LICENSE section. The original prepend:* and append:* sections will be
    removed.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin searches for sections named prepend:TARGET and
    append:TARGET where TARGET is a section name. The text in prepend:*
    section will be prepended to the target section, while text in append:*
    section will be appended to the target section. Target section must
    exist.

    This plugin is useful if you have a section generated by other modules
    but want to add some text to it.
