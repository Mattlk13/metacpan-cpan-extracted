NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Plugin::AppendPrepend - Merge append:FOO and prepend:FOO
    sections in POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.021 of
    Pod::Weaver::Plugin::AppendPrepend (from Perl distribution
    Pod-Weaver-Plugin-AppendPrepend), released on 2024-02-06.

SYNOPSIS
    In your weaver.ini:

     [-AppendPrepend]
     ;exclude_modules = REGEX
     ;exclude_files = REGEX

    In your POD:

     =head1 prepend:FILES

     foo

     =head1 append:COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

     blah blah blah

    In the final document, the text 'foo' will be prepended to the FILES
    section while 'blah blah blah' will be appended to the COPYRIGHT AND
    LICENSE section. The original prepend:* and append:* sections will be
    removed.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin searches for sections named "prepend:TARGET" and
    "append:TARGET" where *TARGET* is a section name. The text in
    "prepend:*" section will be prepended to the target section, while text
    in "append:*" section will be appended to the target section. Target
    section must exist.

    This plugin is useful if you have a section generated by other modules
    but want to add some text to it.

CONFIGURATION
  exclude_modules
  exclude_files
  ignore
    Bool. Default to true. If set to true (the default), then when target
    headline does not exist, instead of dying, ignore append/prepend the
    headline.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
