        my $compressed_array   = $filter->put( [ $scalar ] );
        my $uncompressed_array = $filter->get( $compressed_array );
    
        use POE qw(Filter::Stackable Filter::Line Filter::LZO);
    
        my ($filter) = POE::Filter::Stackable->new();
        $filter->push( POE::Filter::LZO->new(),

DESCRIPTION

    POE::Filter::LZO provides a POE filter for performing
    compression/decompression using Compress::LZO. It is suitable for use
    with POE::Filter::Stackable.

CONSTRUCTOR

    new

      Creates a new POE::Filter::LZO object. Takes one optional argument,
      'level': the level of compression to employ. Consult Compress::LZO
      for details.

METHODS

    get_one_start

    get_one

    get

      Takes an arrayref which is contains lines of compressed input.
      Returns an arrayref of decompressed lines.

    put

      Takes an arrayref containing lines of uncompressed output, returns an
      arrayref of compressed lines.

    clone

      Makes a copy of the filter, and clears the copy's buffer.

    level

      Sets the level of compression employed to the given value. If no
      value is supplied, returns the current level setting.
