SYNOPSIS

     # in your function metadata
     drops_privilege => 'temp'

DESCRIPTION

    Valid values: '', 'temporary' (or 'temp'), or 'permanent' (or 'perm').

    This property declares that function drops privilege (either
    temporarily by setting EUID ($>), or permanently by setting UID ($<))
    during execution. Usually the function is run by superuser and needs to
    perform things on behalf of normal users.

    This property's wrapper implementation currently does this: If
    privilege is dropped temporarily, make sure that we switch back to
    superuser. Sometimes when the function dies, privileges are not
    restored, causing failure to subsequent operation.
