    version 1.10

SYNOPSIS

      my $filter = POE::Filter::IASLog->new();

DESCRIPTION

    POE::Filter::IASLog is a POE::Filter for parsing lines of text that are
    formatted in Microsoft Internet Authentication Service (IAS) log
    format, where attributes are logged as attribute-value pairs.

    POE::Filter::Stackable, with POE::Filter::Line.

METHODS

    get_one

      Takes an arrayref which is contains lines of IAS-formatted text,
      returns an arrayref of IAS hashref records, see Parse::IASLog for
      details of what a record will contain.

    get_pending
