NAME

    POE::Component::Server::Echo - A POE component that implements an RFC
    862 Echo server.

VERSION

    version 1.66

SYNOPSIS

      use POE::Component::Server::Echo;
    
      my $self = POE::Component::Server::Echo->spawn( 
            Alias => 'Echo-Server',
            BindAddress => '127.0.0.1',
            BindPort => 7777,
            options => { trace => 1 },
      );

DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::Server::Echo implements a RFC 862
    http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc862.html TCP/UDP echo server, using POE.
    The component encapsulates a class which may be used to implement
    further RFC protocols.

CONSTRUCTOR

    spawn

      Takes a number of optional values:

        "Alias", the kernel alias that this component is to be blessed with; 
        "BindAddress", the address on the local host to bind to, 
              defaults to L<POE::Wheel::SocketFactory|POE::Wheel::SocketFactory> default; 
        "BindPort", the local port that we wish to listen on for requests, 
              defaults to 7 as per RFC, this will require "root" privs on UN*X; 
        "options", should be a hashref, containing the options for the component's session, 
              see POE::Session for more details on what this should contain.

METHODS

    sockname_tcp

      Takes no arguments. Returns a list consisting of the socket port and
      address of the TCP listening socket as returned by Socket's
      sockaddr_in function.

    sockname_udp

      Takes no arguments. Returns a list consisting of the socket port and
      address of the UDP listening socket as returned by Socket's
      sockaddr_in function.

INPUT EVENTS

    shutdown

      Takes no arguments. Shuts down the component gracefully, terminating
      all listeners and disconnecting all connected clients.
