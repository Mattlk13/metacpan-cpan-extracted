CHANGELOG

v2.06 (2018/08/06)
==================
--Typos in documentation (Debian Perl Group)
--Fixed bug in pflock in Paranoid::Process that failed to apply the 
  flock as requested
--Improved pflock testing as used by Paranoid::Log::File
--Updated Paranoid::IO::Line POD to clarify the third option to many
  functions which control line chomping.
--Improved Paranoid::Process to constrain SIGCHLD handling to only those 
  children forked specifically with/pfork().  This keeps evals and
  miscellaneous system calls from skewing the counter.
--Fixed pchown tests for platforms that use negative numbers for uid/gid

v2.05 (2017/03/23)
==================
--pkmdir would fail when given paths that included . or .. subdirs,
  fixed
--improved error message from pkmdir to make it obvious what specific
  portion of the path failed
--fixed a bug in popen where reopening a filehandle that was stored 
  under its absolute name deleted the internal cache record
--fixed sigchld signal preemption so it doesn't miss children exit
  codes

v2.04 (2016/09/19)
==================
--Added signal dispatcher functionality to Paranoid::Process

v2.03 (2016/08/09)

==================
--Typos in documentation (Debial Perl Group)
--Regex improvement for IPv6 addresses (theodore@grcrun11.gr)

v2.01 (2016/06/23)
==================
--Fixed error in prm where files weren't actually deleted if there was a 
  previous error in $! that set ENOENT
--Fixed error in Paranoid::Filesystem where umask was improperly applied
--Fixed error in popen where mode & perms weren't detainted completely

  to check the return value

--Moved slurp, sip, etc., to Paranoid::IO::Line
--Rewrote slurp, sip, etc., to provide non-locking versions of functions

  Paranoid::IO
--Rewrote and moved Paranoid::Lockfile to Paranoid::IO::Lockfile

--Added passed regex functionality to detaint
--Updated detaint to make target var (third argument) optional
--Updated detaint to work on arrays and hashes as well

  (which eliminates the need to pass by reference for many functions)
--Eliminated pglob from Paranoid::Filesystem.  Globs should be handled
  exclusively through Paranoid::Glob.
--Modified all Paranoid::Filesystem functions to reorder arguments in 
  actual order of importance, making optional arguments truly optional
--Made all Paranoid::Filesystem functions consistent in declaring 
  a filesystem target:  you can pass either a string or a glob, but if
  specifying disparate targets as a list you must pass it as a 
  Paranoid::Glob.
--Removed Paranoid::BerkeleyDB, Paranoid::Log::Syslog, and 
  Paranoid::Log::Email.  Those are now in their own CPAN distributions.
--Added/improved various regexes in Paranoid::Input

  addresses

==================
--Perl-5.6 compatibility fix:  Socket in 5.6 doesn't export AF/PF_INET6, 
  so using Socket6's exclusively
--Perl-5.8 compatibility fix:  Perl's parser chokes on the use of 'bare
  word' imports (i.e., AF_INET), so calling them as subs.
--Optimizing regexes with code-based interpolations of constants
