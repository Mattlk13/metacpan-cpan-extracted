Plack::Middleware::SignedCookies

This middleware modifies "Cookie" headers in the request and
"Set-Cookie" headers in the response. It appends a HMAC digest to
outgoing cookies and removes and verifies it from incoming cookies. It
rejects incoming cookies that were sent without a valid digest.

The incoming "Cookie" header value remains available in the
"signedcookies.orig" key in the PSGI environment.
