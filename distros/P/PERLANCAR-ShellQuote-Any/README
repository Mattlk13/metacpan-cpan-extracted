DESCRIPTION

    This distribution is currently For testing only.

FUNCTIONS

 shell_quote(@cmd) => str

    Quote command @cmd according to OS. On Windows, will use
    Win32::ShellQuote's quote_system_string(). Otherwise, will use
    String::ShellQuote's shell_quote(). Exported by default.

    If you want to simulate how quoting is done under another OS, you could
    do something like:

     {
         local $^O = "Win32"; # simulate Windows
         say shell_quote("foo bar");
     }
