Revision history for Passwd::Keyring::PWSafe3

0.61	2015-01-31

	Better reports from tests.
        Bumping number a bit, module seems rather stable.

0.21	2015-01-12

        Doc tweaks (including note about alternative guis).

        Bumped Crypt::PwSafe3 version (to avoid issues related to the
        way it created temporary files before 1.15).

        Using File::HomeDir to calculate default password file location.

0.2006  2015-01-09

        Minor doc tweaks.

0.2005  2015-01-08

        Minor doc fixes.

0.2004 2015-01-03 

        Bump required Crypt::PWSafe3 version (attempts to use 0.07
        cause my tests to fail due to error in that version of
        Crypt::PWSafe3).

0.2003  2013-07-04

        Bump required perl version (this is in fact Crypt::PWSafe3 dependency,
        but as log as this module does not specify it, I get error reports...)

        (#1) Documentation contained wrong example of using set_password

0.2002  2012-11-26

        A few (non-critical) test fixes.
        Improved example name, installing example in share dir.

0.2001  2012-11-21

        Minor documentation fixes.

0.20    2012-11-20

        Dependencies, comments, test skips etc updated to work with 
        Crypt::PWSafe3 v0.7, which resolves performance problems.
        Module is now reasonably fast and usable (once Crypt::PWSafe3
        >=0.7, and Bytes::Random::Secure are installed)

        Updated example, some test fixes.

0.1001  2012-11-18

        Fixed a few test errors (like bad plans).

0.10    2012-11-15

        Initial release. Works and implements full keyring API,
        although limited performance of Crypt::PWSafe3 seriously
        limits usefulness of save operations.
