Pod::Readme::Brief

This module creates a brief README from a POD document (presumably the
main module of a distribution) with just the information relevant to the
audience who would even look inside such a README: non-Perl people. This
is intended as a sensible boilerplate generated README, unlike the usual
tick-the-box approaches that do not actually help anyone (such as just
converting the entire documentation of the the main module to text, or
putting in just the name and abstract of the distribution).

The following information goes into such a README:

* The "NAME" of the module

* The content of the "DESCRIPTION" section

* Simple installation instructions

* The content of the "LICENSE" section
