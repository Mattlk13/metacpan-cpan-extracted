DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to easily create Gantt charts.

    You can specify the "font" you want but a dependency on
    Alien::Font::Vera is included to have a fallback batteries included font
    available.

CAVEATS
    You can generate images in all formats supported by Imager.

    If you don't have, or don't want to install a TTF font, you can use the
    one provided by Alien::Font::Vera package and everything will just work.
