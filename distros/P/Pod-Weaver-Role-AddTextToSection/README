DESCRIPTION

METHODS

 $obj->add_text_to_section($document, $text, $section[, \%opts]) => bool

    Add a string $text to a section named $section.

    $text will be converted into a POD element tree first.

    Section are POD paragraphs under a heading (=head1, =head2 and so on).
    Section name will be searched case-insensitively.

    If section does not yet already exist: will create the section (if
    create option is true) or will die. Section will be created with =head1
    heading at the bottom of the document (XXX is there a use-case where we
    need to add at the top and need to provide a create_top option? XXX is
    there a use-case where we need to create head2 and so on?).

    If section already exists, will skip and do nothing (if ignore option
    is true, not unlike INSERT OR IGNORE in SQL) or will add text. Text
    will be added at the bottom the existing text, unless when top option
    is true in which case will text will be added at the top the existing
    text.

    Will return a boolean status which is true when text is actually added
    to the section.

    Options:

      * create => bool (default: 1)

      Whether to create section if it does not already exist in the
      document.

      * after_section => str|array

      When creating a section, attempt to put the new section after the
      specified section(s). This is evaluated before before_section.

      * before_section => str|array

      When creating a section, attempt to put the new section before the
      specified section(s).

      * ignore => bool (default: 0)

      If set to true, then if section already exist will skip adding the
      text.

      * top => bool (default: 0)

      If set to true, will add text at the top of existing text instead of
      at the bottom.
