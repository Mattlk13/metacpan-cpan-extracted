DESCRIPTION

    This module can be used to elide lines from a POD string to reduce its
    number of lines (e.g. for summarizing a POD). It will try to elide text
    lines first before POD command lines. head3 will be elided before
    head2, head2 before head1, and so on.

FUNCTIONS

 elide($pod, $len[, \%opts]) => str

    Elide lines from POD string $pod if the string contains more than $len
    lines.

    Known options:

      * marker => str (default: '..')

      * truncate => 'top'|'middle'|'bottom'|'ends' (default: 'bottom')

      * retain_level => int (1|2|3|9, default: 9)
