Parse::PlainConfig
==================

NOTICE:  We've jumped a major rev due to a break in the API.  After ten
years of using Parse::PlainConfig it was inevitable that I would arrive to
the conclusion that while the features was nice it was simply a major PITA
from a developer's perspective.

For that reason this module has been rewritten entirely from scratch with
the aim to make it trivial to implement as a developer.  I find the new
subclassing method to be rather insanely easy, actually, and includes some
new features.

The trade off for that, however, was dropping the config generator,
something that sounded good at the time, but something I never actually
used.  My wager is that no one else did, either.

Legacy Support
--------------

For your convenience I've left the old module in this distribution, albeit
under new namespace.  My hope is that this will require minimal adjustments
to any existing scripts that rely on it.  I truly believe, though, you will
find the new version so much more pleasureable to use that you'll migrate to
that, instead.

The old module is now called Parse::PlainConfig::Legacy.
