CONVERTING POD TO HTML
CONVERTING POD TO MARKDOWN
CONVERTING MARKDOWN TO POD
GETTING THE PATH OF A LOCALLY INSTALLED POD PAGE
LISTING LOCALLY INSTALLED POD PAGES
    You can use podlist. Examples:

    List top-level POD namespaces:

     % podlist

    List all POD pages:

     % podlist -R

MODIFYING POD ELEMENTS
    To reverse the order of POD sections, you can use reverse-pod-headings.

    To sort POD sections by some criteria, you can use sort-pod-headings.

SELECTING POD ELEMENTS
    Pod::Elemental is a system for treating a Pod (plain old documentation)
    documents as trees of elements. podsel uses Pod::Elemental to select the
    tree nodes using a CSS-like expression (see Data::CSel). Examples below.

    Note that pmpath is a CLI utility to return the path of a locally
    installed Perl module (or POD).

    To list all head1 commands of the strict.pm documentation:

     % podsel `pmpath strict` 'Command[command=head1]'
     =head1 NAME

     =head1 SYNOPSIS

     =head1 DESCRIPTION

     =head1 HISTORY

    To list all head1 commands that contain "SYN" in them:

     % podsel `pmpath strict` 'Command[command=head1][content =~ /synopsis/i]'
     =head1 SYNOPSIS

    To show the contents of strict.pm's Synopsis:

     % podsel -5 `pmpath strict` 'Nested[command=head1][content =~ /synopsis/i]'
     =head1 SYNOPSIS

         use strict;

         use strict "vars";
         use strict "refs";
         use strict "subs";

         use strict;
         no strict "vars";

    To show the contents of strict.pm's Synopsis without the head1 command
    itself:

     % podsel -5 `pmpath strict` 'Nested[command=head1][content =~ /synopsis/i] > *'
         use strict;

         use strict "vars";
         use strict "refs";
         use strict "subs";

         use strict;
         no strict "vars";

    To list of head commands in POD of List::Util:

        % podsel `pmpath List::Util` 'Command[command =~ /head/]'
        =head1 NAME

        =head1 SYNOPSIS

        =head1 DESCRIPTION

        =head1 LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS

        =head2 reduce

        =head2 reductions

        ...

        =head1 KEY/VALUE PAIR LIST FUNCTIONS

        =head2 pairs

        =head2 unpairs

        =head2 pairkeys

        =head2 pairvalues

        ...

    To list only key/value pair list functions and not list-reduction ones
    in List::Util:

        % podsel -5 `pmpath List::Util` 'Nested[command=head1][content =~ /pair/i] Nested[command=head2]' --print-method content
        pairs
        unpairs
        pairkeys
        pairvalues
        pairgrep
        pairfirst
        pairmap

VIEWING POD IN THE TERMINAL
VIEWING POD IN THE WEB BROWSER
    Converting the POD to HTML would be the first step. See "CONVERTING POD
    TO HTML".

    podtohtml has a "--browser" ("-b") option to open web browser and
    display the generated HTML:

     % podtohtml some.pod -b
