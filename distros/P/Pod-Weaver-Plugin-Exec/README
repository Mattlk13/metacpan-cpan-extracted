SYNOPSIS

    In your weaver.ini:

     [@Default]
     [-Exec]

    In the pod of one of your modules:

     =head1 EXAMPLE OUTPUT
    
     =for exec
     perl maint/script.pl

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Pod::Weaver plugin that will take the output of a command and
    insert it as literal data into the pod.

PERL SUPPORT POLICY

    Because this module is geared towards helping release code, as opposed
    to helping run code, I only aim at supporting the last 3 releases of
    Perl. So for example, at the time of writing that would be 5.20, 5.18,
    and 5.16. As an author who is developing against Perl and using this to
    release modules, you can use either perlbrew <http://perlbrew.pl/> or
    plenv <https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv> to get a more recent perl to
    release from.

    Don't bother sending patches to support older versions; I could
    probably support 5.8 if I wanted, but this is more so that I can
    continue to use new perl features.
