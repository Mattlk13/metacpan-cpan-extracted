DESCRIPTION

    EARLY RELEASE, MORE EXAMPLES TO COME, CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME.

    This distribution, as the name suggests, contains a random collection
    of various Perl modules/scripts, mostly for testing. Some examples are:

      * script that generates warning

      * script that dies

      * script that contains an endless loop

      * script that grows indefinitely

      * module that contains POD examples

    As more examples are added they might get reorganized (renamed, spun
    off to another dist, etc).
