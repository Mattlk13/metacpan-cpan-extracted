NAME
    Perl::Examples - A collection of various examples of Perl
    modules/scripts

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.096 of Perl::Examples (from Perl
    distribution Perl-Examples), released on 2023-02-24.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution, as the name suggests, contains a random collection of
    various Perl modules/scripts, mostly for testing. Some examples are:

    *   script that generates warning

    *   script that dies

    *   script that contains an endless loop

    *   script that grows indefinitely

    *   module that contains POD examples

    As more examples are added they might get reorganized (renamed, spun off
    to another dist, etc).

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
