NAME
    Perl::Examples - A collection of various examples of Perl
    modules/scripts

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.095 of Perl::Examples (from Perl
    distribution Perl-Examples), released on 2020-03-07.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution, as the name suggests, contains a random collection of
    various Perl modules/scripts, mostly for testing. Some examples are:

    *   script that generates warning

    *   script that dies

    *   script that contains an endless loop

    *   script that grows indefinitely

    *   module that contains POD examples

    As more examples are added they might get reorganized (renamed, spun off
    to another dist, etc).
