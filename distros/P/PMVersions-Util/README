DESCRIPTION
    pmversions.ini is a file that list (minimum) version of modules. This
    module provides routines related to this file.

FUNCTIONS
  read_pmversions
    Usage:

     read_pmversions([ $path ]) => hash

    Read pmversions.ini and return a hash of module names and versions. If
    $path is not specified, will look at "PMVERSIONS_PATH" environment
    variable, or defaults to ~/pmversions.ini. Will die if file cannot be
    read or parsed.

  version_from_pmversions
    Usage:

     version_from_pmversions($mod [ , $path ]) => str

    Check version from pmversions file. $path will be passed to
    "read_pmversions" only the first time; after that, the contents of the
    file is cached in a hash variable so the pmversions file is only read
    and parsed once.

ENVIRONMENT
  PMVERSIONS_PATH
    String. Set location of pmversions.ini instead of the default
    "~/pmversions.ini". Example: "/etc/minver.conf".
