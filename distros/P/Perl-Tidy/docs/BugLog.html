<dt id="removed-excess-spaces-in-a-package-declaration"><b>removed excess spaces in a package declaration</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Testing revealed that for a line such as</p>

<pre><code>   package        Bob::Dog;</code></pre>

<p>which has extra spaces or even tabs after the keyword &#39;package&#39;, the extra spaces or tabs were not being removed. This was fixed 28 Nov 2020, 008443d. The line now formats to</p>

<p>For the parameter combination --indent-only and --closing-side-comments, old closing side comments were getting deleted but new closing side comments were not made. A fix was made to prevent this deletion. This fix was made 27 Nov 2020, 957e0ca.</p>

<dt id="fix-for-formatting-signed-numbers-with-spaces"><b>fix for formatting signed numbers with spaces</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>In developing an improved convergence test, an issue slowing convergence was found related to signed numbers as in the following line,</p>

<pre><code>    @london = (deg2rad(-  0.5), deg2rad(90 - 51.3));</code></pre>

<p>The leading &#39;-&#39; here is separated from the following number &#39;0.5&#39;. This is handled by tokenizing the minus as type &#39;m&#39; and the number as type &#39;n&#39;. The whitespace between them is removed in formatting, and so the space is gone in the output. But a little problem is that the default rule for placing spaces within the parens is based on the token count, after the first formatting the result is</p>

<pre><code>    @london = ( deg2rad( -0.5 ), deg2rad( 90 - 51.3 ) );</code></pre>

<p>The next time it is formatted, the &#39;-0.5&#39; counts as one token, resulting in</p>

<pre><code>    @london = ( deg2rad(-0.5), deg2rad( 90 - 51.3 ) );</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the space within the parens around the &#39;-0.5&#39; is gone. An update was made to fix this, so that the final state is reached in one step. This fix was made 23 Nov 2020, f477c8b.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="fix-to-prevent-conversion-of-a-block-comment-to-hanging-side-comment"><b>fix to prevent conversion of a block comment to hanging side comment</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A rare situation was identified during testing in which a block comment could be converted to be a hanging side comment. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    sub macro_get_names {    #
    #
    # %name = macro_get_names();  (key=macrohandle, value=macroname)
    #
        local (%name) = ();
        ...
    }</code></pre>

<p>For the following specific contitions the block comment in line 2 could be converted into a hanging side comment, which is undesirable:</p>

<pre><code>   1. The line contains nothing except for a &#39;#&#39; with no leading space
   2. It follows a line with side comment
   3. It has indentation level &gt; 0</code></pre>

<p>An update was made to prevent this from happening. There are two cases, depending on the value of --maximum-consecutive-blank-lines, or -mbl. If this value is positive (the default) then a blank line is inserted above the block comment to prevent it from becoming a hanging side comment. If this -mbl is zero, then the comment is converted to be a static block comment which again prevents it from becoming a hanging side comment. This fix was made 23 Nov 2020, 2eb3de1.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="improved-convergence-test"><b>improved convergence test</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A better test for convergence has been added. When iterations are requested, the new test will stop after the first pass if no changes in line break locations are made. Previously, at least two passes were required to verify convergnece unless the output stream had the same checksum as the input stream. Extensive testing has been made to verify the correctness of the new test. This update was made 23 Nov 2020, 29efb63.</p>

<dt id="fixed-problem-with-vertical-alignments-involving-if-statements"><b>fixed problem with vertical alignments involving &#39;if&#39; statements</b></dt>

<p>An update was made to break vertical alignment when a new sequence of if-like statements or ternary statements is encountered. This situation was causing a loss of alignment in some cases. For example</p>

<pre><code>  OLD:
    $m1 = 0;
    if ( $value =~ /\bset\b/i )      { $m0 = 1; }
    if ( $value =~ /\barithmetic/i ) { $m1 = 1; }

<p>The line parsed correctly with a space between the &#39;$$&#39; and the &#39;*&#39;. The problem had to do with an error in some newer code for postfix dereferencing, and this was fixed on 2 Nov 2020, &#39;fix problem scanning &#39;$$&#39;; revise call to operator_expected&#39;, 49d993b.</p>

<p>In stress testing perltidy with the -extrude option, the following test snippet</p>

<pre><code>  use perl6-alpha;</code></pre>

<p>was broken into sepate lines</p>

<pre><code>  use

  ;</code></pre>

<p>A rule was added to prevent breaking around a dash separating two barewords. Rerunning gives</p>

<pre><code>  use

<p>This was fixed 26 Oct 2020 in &#39;prevent breaking package names with trailing dashes&#39;, 9234be4.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Prevent-syntax-error-by-breaking-dashed-barewords"><b>Prevent syntax error by breaking dashed barewords</b></dt>

<p>a syntax error was created when newlines were placed before or after the dashes. It is necessary to always keep a dash on the same line with its surrounding tokens. A rule was added to do this. The new &#39;extruded&#39; result for the above snippet is:</p>

<dt id="more-types-of-severe-errors-will-prevent-formatting"><b>more types of severe errors will prevent formatting</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Files for which &#39;severe errors&#39; are found have always been output verbatim rather than being formatted. The definition of &#39;severe error&#39; has been expanded to include a final indentation level error greater than 1, more than 2 brace errors, and more than 3 &quot;unexpected token type&quot; parsing errors. The goal is to avoid formatting a non-perl script or a perl script with severe errors. So for example the following snippet has a level error of 2</p>

<pre><code>  {{{{
  }}</code></pre>

<p>was previously output with default parameters as</p>

<pre><code>  { 
      {
          {
              {}
          }</code></pre>

<p>along with an error message. But now it is just output verbatim as</p>

<pre><code>  {{{{
  }}</code></pre>

<p>along with an error message. This update was added 25 Oct 2020, &#39;avoid formatting files with more types of severe errors&#39;, 2a86f51.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="added-state-as-keyword"><b>added &#39;state&#39; as keyword</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A statement such as the following was generating an error message at the colon:</p>

<pre><code>   state $a : shared;</code></pre>

<p>The problem was that &#39;state&#39; was not in the list of keywords. This has been fixed and the line now parses without error. The &#39;state.t&#39; test file for perl 5.31 now formats without error. This was added 18 Oct 2020 in &quot;add &#39;state&#39; as keyword&quot;, d73e15f.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="sub-signatures-no-longer-parsed-with-prototypes"><b>sub signatures no longer parsed with prototypes</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Simple signatures (those without commas) were being parsed with code originally written for prototypes. This prevented them from being formatted with the usual formatting rules. This was changed so that all signatures are now formatted with the normal formatting rules. For example:</p>

<pre><code> # Old, input and after formatting:
 sub t123 ($list=wantarray) { $list ? &quot;list&quot; : &quot;scalar&quot; }

 # New, after formatting
 sub t123 ( $list = wantarray ) { $list ? &quot;list&quot; : &quot;scalar&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>Notice that some spaces have been introduced within the signature. Previously the contents of the parens not changed unless the parens contained a list.</p>

<p>This change introduced a problem parsing extended syntax within signatures which has been fixed. In the following snippet, the &#39;:&#39; caused a parsing error which was fixed.</p>

<pre><code>  # perltidy -sal=&#39;method&#39;
  method foo4 ( $class : $bar, $bubba ) { $class-&gt;bar($bar) }</code></pre>

<p>The &#39;:&#39; here is given a type of &#39;A&#39;. This may be used to change the spacing around it. For example:</p>

<pre><code>  # perltidy -sal=&#39;method&#39; -nwls=&#39;A&#39;
  method foo4 ( $class: $bar, $bubba ) { $class-&gt;bar($bar) }</code></pre>

<p>This update was added 18 Oct 2020, in &#39;format all signatures separately from prototypes&#39;, e6a10f3. The test file &#39;signatures.t&#39; distributed with perl5.31 formats without error now.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="fix-parsing-problem-with"><b>fix parsing problem with $#</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A problem with parsing variables of the form $# and $#array was found in testing and fixed. For most variables the leading sigil may be separated from the remaining part of the identifier by whitespace. An exception is for a variable beginning with &#39;$#&#39;. If there is any space between the &#39;$&#39; and &#39;#&#39; then the &#39;#&#39; starts a comment. So the following snippet is has valid syntax and is equivalent to $ans=40;</p>

<pre><code>    my $ #
    #
    ans = 40;</code></pre>

<p>This was being misparsed and was fixed 17 Oct 2020, in &#39;fixed parsing error with spaces in $#&#39; a079cdb.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="fix-missing-line-break-for-hash-of-subs-with-signatures"><b>fix missing line break for hash of subs with signatures</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>During testing the following error was found and fixed. Given the following input snippet:</p>

<pre><code>    get(
        on_ready =&gt; sub ($worker) {
            $on_ready-&gt;end;
            return;
        },
        on_exit =&gt; sub ( $worker, $status ) { return; },
    );</code></pre>

<p>The resulting formatting was</p>

<pre><code>    get(
        on_ready =&gt; sub ($worker) {
            $on_ready-&gt;end;
            return;
        }, on_exit =&gt; sub ( $worker, $status ) { return; },
    );</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the break after the comma has been lost. The problem was traced to a short-cut taken by the code looking for one-line blocks. The unique circumstances in which this occured involved a hash of anonymous subs, one with a signature with multiple parameters and short enough to be a one-line block, as in the last sub definition line. This was fixed 17 Oct 2020 in &#39;fix missing line break for hash of subs with signatures&#39;, 51428db.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="fix-issues-with-prototype-and-signature-parsing"><b>fix issues with prototype and signature parsing</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Problems with parsing prototypes and signatures were found during testing and fixed 17 Oct 2020 in &#39;fixed problem parsing multi-line signatures with comments&#39;, 017fd07. For example the following snippet was mis-parsed because of the hash mark.</p>

<pre><code>    sub test ( # comment ))) 
        $x, $x) { $x+$y }</code></pre>

<p>Complex signature expressions such as the following are now parsed without error:</p>

<pre><code>    sub t086
        ( #foo)))
        $ #foo)))
        a #foo)))

<p>The following line caused a tokenization error in which the two slashes were parsed as a pattern.</p>

<pre><code>   my $masksize = ceil( Opcode::opcodes / 8 );    # /</code></pre>

<p>This problem was discovered in random testing. When a slash follows a bareword whose prototype is not known to perltidy, it has to guess whether the slash starts a pattern or is a division. The guessing logic was rewritten and improved 14 Oct 2020 in &#39;rewrote logic to guess if divide or pattern&#39;, afebe2f.</p>

<dt id="fix--bos-to-keep-isolated-semicolon-breaks-after-block-braces"><b>fix -bos to keep isolated semicolon breaks after block braces</b></dt>

<p>The flag <b>-bos</b>, or <b>--break-at-old-semicolon-breakpoints</b>, keeps breaks at old isolated semicolons. For example</p>

<pre><code>    $z = sqrt($x**2 + $y**2)
      ;</code></pre>

<p>In testing it was found not to be doing this after braces which require semicolons, such as &#39;do&#39; and anonymous subs. This was fixed 12 Oct 2020 in &#39;fix -bos to work with semicolons after braces&#39;, 03ee7fc. For example</p>

<pre><code>    my $dist = sub {
        $z = sqrt( $x**2 + $y**2 )

      }

<p>If a line break occurs after <b>use overload</b> then it will now be kept. Previously it was dropped. For example, this would be kept intact:</p>

<pre><code>                use overload
                    &#39;+&#39; =&gt; sub {
                        print length $_[2], &quot;\n&quot;;
                        my ( $x, $y ) = _order(@_);
                        Number::Roman-&gt;new( int $x + $y );
                    },
                    &#39;-&#39; =&gt; sub {
                        my ( $x, $y ) = _order(@_);
                        Number::Roman-&gt;new( int $x - $y );
                    },
                    ...</code></pre>

<p>This keeps the list from shifting to the right and can avoid problems in formatting the list with certain styles, including with the -xci flag. Fixed 12 Oct 2020 in &#39;keep break after use overload statement&#39;, 8485afa.</p>

<p>This flag causes continuation indentation to &quot;extend&quot; deeper into structures. If you use <b>-ci=n</b> and <b>-i=n</b> with the same value of <b>n</b> you will probably want to set this flag.

<p>In random testing, the -mangle option introduced a syntax error by deleting the space between barewords and quotes (test file &#39;MxScreen&#39;), such as:</p>

<pre><code>  oops&quot;Your login, $Bad_Login, is not valid&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>The .LOG file reports any disagreements between the indentation of the input and output files. This can help locate brace errors. These were incorrect when some of the options were used, including --whitespace-cycle, -bbhb, -nib. This was corrected 24 Sep 2020, &#39;fixed incorrect log entry for indentation disagreement&#39;, 3d40545. At the same time, locations of closing brace indentation disagreements are now tracked and reported in the .ERR file when there is a brace error. This can help localize the error if the file was previously formatted by perltidy.</p>

Perl silently accepts this but it can cause significant problems with pod utilities, so a clear warning is better. This situation arose in testing on random files in combination with a -dp flag and it took some time to understand the results because of the lack of a warning.</p>

<p>These are known issues which have not been fixed.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="lexical-subs-not-fully-supported"><b>lexical subs not fully supported</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Basic parsing of lexical subs works but some aspects of lexical subs are not yet functional. One of these is that unlike regular subs, lexical subs can override names of builtin functions.</p>

<p>First consider the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>  sub s { 
    my $arg=$_[0];
    print &quot;s called with arg $arg\n&quot;;
  }
  s(1);
  s(2);</code></pre>

<p>The &#39;s&#39; in the two last lines is the builtin s function, not the sub. Both perltidy and perl make the same assumption here. This program happens to still run but prints nothing. It will not run if the last semicolon is removed.</p>

<p>Now consider the following snippet in which the sub has a preceding &#39;my&#39;</p>

<pre><code>  use feature &#39;lexical_subs&#39;, &#39;signatures&#39;;
  my sub s { 
    my $arg=$_[0];
    print &quot;s called with arg $arg\n&quot;;
  }
  s(1);
  s(2);</code></pre>

<p>The builtin function &#39;s&#39; is replaced by the sub s here, and the program runs. Perltidy will format this but it is assuming that the s in the two last lines are the builtin s function. If the last semicolon is removed, there will be an formatting error. So perltidy and perl make different assumptions in this case.</p>

<p>Another issue is that perltidy does not yet remember the extent of the scope of a lexical sub.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="issues-with-paren-less-calls"><b>issues with paren-less calls</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Consider the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>  use Test::More;
  ok open($stdin, &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $1), &#39;open ... &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $magical_fileno&#39;, ||  _diag $!;</code></pre>

<p>Note the unusual situation of a comma followed by an &#39;||&#39;. Perltidy will format this satisfactorally but it will write an error message. The syntax is correct, however. Perl knows the prototype of the &#39;ok&#39; function, which is called here without parens, so the last comma marks the last arg and is needed to keep the || from attaching to the last arg.</p>

<p>Full support of peren-less calls will probably never be implemented in perltidy because it would require that it parse all of the modules used to find the prototypes. This would make it impossible to run perltidy on small snippets of code from within an editor.</p>

<p>The problem can be avoid if parens are used:</p>

<pre><code>  ok ( open($stdin, &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $1), &#39;open ... &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $magical_fileno&#39;) ||  _diag $!;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="multiple-sub-paren-calls"><b>multiple sub paren calls</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Perltidy currently flags as an error a closing paren followed by an opening paren, as in the following</p>

<pre><code>  $subsubs[0]()(0)</code></pre>

<p>This syntax is ok. The example is from test &#39;current_sub.t&#39; in perl5.31.</p>
