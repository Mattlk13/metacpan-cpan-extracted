DESCRIPTION

    This module is a fork of Module::List 0.003. It's exactly like
    Module::List, except for the following differences:

      * lower startup overhead (with some caveats)

      It strips the usage of Exporter, IO::Dir, Carp, File::Spec, with the
      goal of saving a few milliseconds (a casual test on my PC results in
      11ms vs 39ms).

      Path separator is hard-coded as /.

      * Recognize return_path option

      Normally the returned hash has undef as the values. With this option
      set to true, the values will contain the path instead. Useful if you
      want to collect all the paths, instead of having to use Module::Path
      or Module::Path::More for each module again.

      * Recognize all option

      If set to true and return_path is also set to true, will return all
      found paths for each module instead of just the first found one. The
      values of result will be an arrayref containing all found paths.
