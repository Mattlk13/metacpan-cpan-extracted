NAME
    PERLANCAR::Module::List - A fork of Module::List

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004005 of PERLANCAR::Module::List
    (from Perl distribution PERLANCAR-Module-List), released on 2019-09-12.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would Module::List, e.g.:

     use PERLANCAR::Module::List qw(list_modules);

     $id_modules = list_modules("Data::ID::", { list_modules => 1});
     $prefixes = list_modules("", { list_prefixes => 1, recurse => 1 });

DESCRIPTION
    This module is my personal experimental fork of Module::List; the
    experiment has also produced other forks like Module::List::Tiny,
    Module::List::Wildcard. It's like Module::List, except for the following
    differences:

    *   lower startup overhead (with some caveats)

        It avoids using Exporter and implements its own import(). It avoids
        IO::Dir, Carp, File::Spec, with the goal of saving a few
        milliseconds (a casual test on my PC results in 11ms vs 39ms).

        Path separator is hard-coded as "/".

    *   Recognize "all" option

        If set to true and "return_path" is also set to true, will return
        all found paths for each module instead of just the first found one.
        The values of result will be an arrayref containing all found paths.

    *   Recognize "wildcard" option

        This boolean option can be set to true to recognize wildcard pattern
        in prefix. Wildcard patterns such as jokers ("?", "*", "**"),
        classes ("[a-z]"), as well as braces ("{One,Two}") are supported.
        "**" implies recursive listing.

        Examples:

         list_modules("Module::P*", {wildcard=>1, list_modules=>1});

        results in something like:

         {
             "Module::Patch"             => undef,
             "Module::Path"              => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable"         => undef,
         }

        while:

         list_modules("Module::P**", {wildcard=>1, list_modules=>1});

        results in something like:

         {
             "Module::Patch"             => undef,
             "Module::Path"              => undef,
             "Module::Path::More"        => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable"         => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable::Object" => undef,
         }

        while:

         list_modules("Module::**le", {wildcard=>1, list_modules=>1});

        results in something like:

         {
             "Module::Depakable"                => undef,
             "Module::Install::Admin::Bundle"   => undef,
             "Module::Install::Admin::Makefile" => undef,
             "Module::Install::Bundle"          => undef,
             "Module::Install::Makefile"        => undef,
             "Module::Pluggable"                => undef,
         }
