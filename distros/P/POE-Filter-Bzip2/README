SYNOPSIS

        use POE::Filter::Bzip2;
    
        my $filter = POE::Filter::Bzip2->new();
        my $scalar = 'Blah Blah Blah';
        my $compressed_array   = $filter->put( [ $scalar ] );
        my $uncompressed_array = $filter->get( $compressed_array );
    
        use POE qw(Filter::Stackable Filter::Line Filter::Bzip2);
    
        my ($filter) = POE::Filter::Stackable->new();
        $filter->push( POE::Filter::Bzip2->new(),
                       POE::Filter::Line->new( InputRegexp => '\015?\012', OutputLiteral => "\015\012" ),

DESCRIPTION

    POE::Filter::Bzip2 provides a POE filter for performing
    compression/decompression using Compress::Bzip2. It is suitable for use
    with POE::Filter::Stackable.

CONSTRUCTOR

    new

      Creates a new POE::Filter::Bzip2 object. Takes one optional argument,
      'level': the level of compression to employ. Consult Compress::Bzip2
      for details.

METHODS

    get =item get_one =item get_one_start

      Takes an arrayref which is contains lines of compressed input.
      Returns an arrayref of decompressed lines.

    put

      Takes an arrayref containing lines of uncompressed output, returns an
      arrayref of compressed lines.

    clone

      Makes a copy of the filter, and clears the copy's buffer.

    level

      Sets the level of compression employed to the given value. If no
      value is supplied, returns the current level setting.
