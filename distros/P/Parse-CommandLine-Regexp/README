NAME
    Parse::CommandLine::Regexp - Parsing string like command line

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Parse::CommandLine::Regexp
    (from Perl distribution Parse-CommandLine-Regexp), released on
    2020-04-09.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an alternative to Parse::CommandLine, using regexp
    instead of per-character parsing technique employed by
    Parse::CommandLine, and which might offer better performance in Perl
    (see benchmarks in Bencher::Scenario::CmdLineParsingModules).

    "parse_command_line", the main routine, basically split a string into
    "words", with whitespaces as delimiters while also taking into account
    quoting using """ (double-quote character) and "'" (single-quote
    character) as well as escaping using "\" (backslash character). This
    splitting is similar to, albeit simpler than, what a shell like bash
    does to its command-line string.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_command_line
    Usage:

     my @words = parse_command_line($str);

    module, but also takes into account non-whitespace word-breaking
    character such as "|".
