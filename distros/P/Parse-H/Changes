Revision history for Parse-H

2023-10-15	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro \at\ cpan . org>

	* Version 0.20
	  Many significant improvements and fixes in parsing, especially with
	  structures and unions and their elements. Better parsing typedefs,
	  multiline and multi-variable declarations. Better resistance to the
	  callbacks returning undef. Removing attributes prior to parsing.
	  Improvements and simplifications in tests, reaching 100% coverage.
	  Other small changes and fixes in code and documentation.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm: Fixed the docs on calling the subroutines. Updated
	  the copyright and version. Deleted the cpanratings.perl.org link
	  (thanks to Peter John Acklam for reporting).
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (parse_struct): Fixed the expressions for structure
	  names. Fixed infinite loop with "struct {};". Fixed endless loop
	  with struct inside a struct. Fixed endless loop with struct inside a
	  typedef. Modify the structure size only if the element size is a
	  number. Support structure arrays. Added and updated checking for
	  empty or forward structure declarations. Don't do output if skipping
	  an empty structure.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (parse_union): Fixed the expressions for union names.
	  Fixed endless loop with union inside a union. Fixed endless loop
	  with union inside a typedef. Modify the union size only if the
	  element size is a number. Support union arrays. Fixed calling
	  structure entry sub instead of union entry. Allow non-digit array
	  sizes in unions. Added checking for empty or forward union
	  declarations. Don't do output if skipping an empty union.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (parse_file): Checking if some of the called
	  subroutines return undef. Fixed the expressions when structure or
	  union lines need to be skipped. Fixed parsing typedefs and parsing
	  just variable types. Moved checking for forward or empty structure
	  and union declarations to parse_struct and parse_union. Fixed joining
	  lines with >extern "C"<. Set the next enum value only if the current
	  is a number. Allow enums with negative values. Skip standalone "{"
	  in output.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (parse_struct, parse_union): Checking if some of the
	  called subroutines return undef. Use _output_array_entry_size() to
	  process array entries. Support simple 'int' entries. Fixed splitting
	  multiple pointer variable declarations on a single line. Simplified
	  some regexes. Fixed regexes for long ints. Parse all int types before
	  the 'int' type itself. Fixed removing standalone "{" characters.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (_output_array_entry_size): A new private subroutine
	  for common code in struct and union array fields.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (_remove_attrs): A new private subroutine for removing
	  function and variable attributes from declarations.
	* lib/Parse/H.pm (parse_struct, parse_union, parse_file): Allow other
	  line endings. Remove function and variable attributes.
	* t/z_parse_file.t: Simplified resetting and validating the variables.
	  Added many more tests, especially with missing subroutines or ones
	  which return undef. Changed $enum_end_sub returning undef to return
	  and empty string. Added debugging statements.
	* README: Updated the copyright. Deleted the cpanratings.perl.org link
	  and the plain HTTP links.

2022-10-31	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro \at\ cpan . org>

	* Version 0.11
	* t/z_parse_file.t: Added missing imports.

2022-10-17	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro \at\ cpan . org>

	* Version 0.10
	  Initial version. Parsing structures, unions, enumerations,
	  preprocessor statements, comments, typedefs and external
	  declarations. Accepting configuration hashes.
	  The module was created from utility scripts called CallbackCParse.pl
	  and HParser, for the C header - to - assembly language converters,
	  which currently are a part of Project Asmosis
	  (https://asmosis.sourceforge.io/).
