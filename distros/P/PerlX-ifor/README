NAME
    PerlX::ifor - A version of for() that accepts iterator instead of list

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of PerlX::ifor (from Perl
    distribution PerlX-ifor), released on 2019-04-16.

SYNOPSIS
    With Array::Iter or Range::Iter which generates a coderef iterator:

     use PerlX::ifor;
     use Array::Iter qw(array_iter list_iter);
     use Range::Iter qw(range_iter);

     ifor { say } iter_range("a", "z");

DESCRIPTION
    CAVEAT: Yes, it's ugly and doesn't look like a regular for(). Sue Perl
    :-)

    TODO: Support other iterator, e.g. Array::Iterator.
