Plack::App::Hostname

This PSGI application dispatches requests to any number of other
applications based on the "Host" request header. This is sometimes
referred to as virtual hosting. The mapping as well as the configuration
is reconfigurable at runtime with immediate effect. It is fast in the
simple case but will accept a custom match callback to support complex
scenarios.

One likely "complex" scenario is deployment on a multiprocess forking
server, where updates to the mapping only take effect per worker
process. Arranging for all workers to update their mappings in lockstep
is fiddly but a custom matcher doing lookups against some type of
IPC-able table is not.

Instances of this application can be introspected to ask whether a
particular hostname can be dispatched. This makes it easy to make other
parts of compound PSGI applications adapt to changes in the dynamic
mapping.
