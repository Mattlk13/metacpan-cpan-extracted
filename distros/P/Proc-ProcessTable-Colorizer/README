Proc-ProcessTable-Colorizer

This colorizes the output from Proc::ProcessTable.

This is largely meant to be used from the command line instead of
as a module via the included bin script.

Among other fun things, it allows searching of the process table.

Searching is currently possible against the folowing criteria.

    zombie
    swapped out
    regex command line matching
    CPU seconds used by a process
    percent of memory usage
    percent of CPU usage
    wait channel in use
