SYNOPSIS

     use Perinci::Sub::Wrapper::HandlePHPArray;

DESCRIPTION

    This module patches Perinci::Sub::Wrapper so the generated function
    wrapper code can convert argument {} to [] when function expects
    argument to be an array, or vice versa [] to {} when function expects a
    hash argument. This can help if function is being called by PHP
    clients, because in PHP Array() is ambiguous, it can be an empty hash
    or an empty array.

    To make this work, you have to specify schema in your argument
    specification in your Rinci metadata, and the type must be hash or
    array.

    This is a temporary/stop-gap solution. The more "official" solution is
    to use Perinci::Access::HTTP::Server which has the
    deconfuse_php_clients option (by default turned on).
