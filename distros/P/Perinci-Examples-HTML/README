NAME
    Perinci::Examples::HTML - Examples related to HTML form generation

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Perinci::Examples::HTML (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-HTML), released on 2022-11-17.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  hello1
    Usage:

     hello1(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Accept a choice of salutation, an optional name and return a greeting.

    The acceptable name is restricted to safe characters only so it is safe
    when it needs to be displayed as HTML without any escaping.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   name => *str*

        (No description)

    *   salutation => *str*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
