=head1 NAME

PDF::PDFUnit::Config - Creating a configuration file for PDF::PDFUnit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDF::PDFUnit needs to know where PDFUnit-Java is installed.
For that purpose you need a small and simple configuration file
with the following content:

  pdfunit_java_home = <YOUR_PDFUNIT_JAVA_INSTALLATION_FOLDER>

The value will be globbed, i.e. you can use OS-dependent wildcards like
C<*> or C<~>.

There are many possible locations where you can place this config file,
also OS-dependent. I<The first one found "wins"!>
