NAME

    POE::Loop::EV - a bridge that supports EV from POE

SYNOPSIS

        use POE 'Loop::EV';
        
        ...
        
        POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION

    This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop interface. It
    follows POE::Loop's public interface exactly. Therefore, please see
    POE::Loop for its documentation.

CAVEATS

    Certain EV backends do not support polling on normal filehandles,
    namely epoll and kqueue. You should avoid using regular filehandles
    with select_read, select_write, ReadWrite, etc.

    See the libev documentation
    <http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#PORTABILITY_NOTES>
    for more information on portability issues with different EV backends.
