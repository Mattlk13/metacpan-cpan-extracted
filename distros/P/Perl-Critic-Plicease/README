NAME

    Perl::Critic::Plicease - Some Perl::Critic policies used by Plicease

VERSION

    version 0.04

DESCRIPTION

    The Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease policies are an eclectic collection
    of Perl::Critic policies. They aren't grouped into a theme because some
    are application specific and you should review and include them only on
    a case by case basis.

    Plicease::ProhibitLeadingZeros

      This is a slight remix on the prohibit leading zeros policy with some
      helpful exceptions.

    Plicease::ProhibitUnicodeDigitInRegexp

      Prohibit \d (match any digit) in regular expressions without the /a
      or /u modifier.
