DESCRIPTION

    The Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease policies are an eclectic collection

    are application specific and you should review and include them only on
    a case by case basis.

      This is a slight remix on the prohibit leading zeros policy with some
      helpful exceptions.

      Prohibit the use of @_ in subroutine using signatures

    Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease::ProhibitSpecificModules

      Prohibit the use of specific modules or pragmas

    Plicease::ProhibitUnicodeDigitInRegexp

      Prohibit \d (match any digit) in regular expressions without the /a
      or /u modifier.
