SYNOPSIS

     use Parse::Number::EN qw(parse_number_en $Pat);
    
     my @a = map {parse_number_en(text=>$_)}
         ("12,345.67", "-1.2e3", "x123", "1.23", "1,23");
     # @a = (12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23, 1)
    
     my @b = map {/^$Pat$/ ? 1:0}
         ("12,345.67", "-1.2e3", "x123", "1,23");
     # @b = (1, 1, 0, 0)

DESCRIPTION

    The goal for this module is to parse/extract numbers written in some
    common notation in English text. That means, in addition to what Perl
    does, it also recognizes thousand separators (and fractions,
    percentages in the future).

VARIABLES

    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

 $Pat (REGEX)

    A regex for quickly matching/extracting number from text. It's not 100%
    perfect (the extracted number might not be valid), but it's simple and
    fast.

FAQ

 How does this module differ from other number-parsing modules?

    This module uses a single regex and provides the regex for you to use.
    Other modules might be more accurate and/or faster. But this module is
    pretty fast.
