- Many of the transforms are awkward and slow using
  threaded/vectorized expressions.  PP would greatly improve matters.
  Conversions probably run 3x-10x slower than they could because of this.

- Even using threaded/vectorized expressions, the expressions are
  better optimized for programmer understanding than for speed.  This probably
  induces another 2x speed hit over an optimized PP solution.
