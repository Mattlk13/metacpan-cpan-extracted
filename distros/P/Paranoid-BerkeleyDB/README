Paranoid::BerkeleyDB
====================

  This module provides BerkeleyDB CDS support from within the Paranoid
framework. 

NOTE:  This is a complete rewrite with an incompatible API compared to
previous versions.  It was written to be easier to use but can no longer 
be considered fork-safe.  Please see documentation for more details.

  Please send bugs, requests, and flames to Arthur Corliss
<corliss@digitalmages.com>.
