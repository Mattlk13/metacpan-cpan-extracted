NAME
    Pod::From::Acme::CPANModules - Generate POD from an Acme::CPANModules::*
    module

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.012 of Pod::From::Acme::CPANModules
    (from Perl distribution Pod-From-Acme-CPANModules), released on
    2022-01-15.

SYNOPSIS
     use Pod::From::Acme::CPANModules qw(gen_pod_from_acme_cpanmodules);

     my $res = gen_pod_from_acme_cpanmodules(module => 'Acme::CPANModules::PERLANCAR::Favorites');

FUNCTIONS
  gen_pod_from_acme_cpanmodules
    Usage:

     gen_pod_from_acme_cpanmodules(%args) -> any

    Generate POD from an Acme::CPANModules::* module.

    Currently what this routine does:

    *   Fill the Description section from the CPANModules' list description

    *   Add an "Acme::CPANModules Entries" section, containing the
        CPANModules' list entries

    *   Add an "Acme::CPANModules Feature Comparison Matrix" section, if one
        or more entries have 'features'

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   additional_props => *array[str]*

        This lets you include additional properties (or attributes) from the
        entry defhash to the POD. This option will not be used if you
        completely customize the entry POD output using the
        "entry_description_code" option. This option is an alternative when
        you want to display some additional properties/attributes in the
        entry as POD but does not want to completely customize the POD
        yourself.

        The element of this option is property/attribute name, optionally
        followed by ":..." suffix to set the caption to show it with, then
        optionally followed by formatting suffix:

        *   ":url" to render it as a link ("L<...>")

        *   ":mono" suffix to render it in monospace characters ("C<...>")

        *   ":quoted" (the default) to render it normally but quote it first
            using String::PodQuote

        *   ":perl:..." to let a Perl code format it.

        Example:

         # option
         additional_props => [
             q(ruby_package:Ruby project's gem:perl:"https://rubygems.org/gems/$_[0]"),
             "ruby_website_url:Ruby project's website:url",
         ],

        with this entry:

         {
             module => "Valiant",
             ruby_package => "rails",
             ruby_website_url => "https://rubyonrails.org",
         }

        the additional POD produced will be something like:

         Ruby project's gem: LL<https://rubygems.org/gems/rails>
 
         Ruby project's website: LL<https://rubyonrails.org>

        See also the "entry_description_code" option.

    *   entry_description_code => *code*

        This lets you completely customize the description POD for each
        entry, using Perl code. The Perl code will receive the entry hashref
        as its argument and is expected to produce a POD string.

        See also the "additional_props" option.

    *   list => *hash*

        As an alternative to `module`, you can directly supply $LIST here.

    *   module => *str*

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
