SYNOPSIS

    In lib/YourModule.pm:

     package YourModule;
     use PERLANCAR::Exporter::Lite qw(import);
     our @EXPORT = qw(...);
     our @EXPORT_OK = qw(...);

DESCRIPTION

    This is a stripped down exporter module, to achieve the smallest
    startup overhead (see Bencher::Scenario::Exporters::Startup for
    benchmark). This is what I think Exporter::Lite should be.

    This module offers only some features of Exporter: default exports via
    @EXPORT and optional exports via @EXPORT_OK. You can only use this
    exporter by importing its import and not by subclassing. There is no
    support for export tags, export_to_level, etc.
