VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Package::Util::Lite (from Perl
    distribution Package-Util-Lite), released on 2019-01-06.

SYNOPSIS
     use Package::Util::Lite qw(
         package_exists
         list_subpackages
     );

     print "Package Foo::Bar exists" if package_exists("Foo::Bar");

     my @subpkg    = list_subpackages("Foo::Bar");
     my @allsubpkg = list_subpackages("Foo::Bar", 1); # recursive

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides package-related utilities. You should check
    Package::Stash first, then here.

FUNCTIONS
  package_exists
    Usage:

     package_exists($name) => bool

    Return true if package "exists". By "exists", it means that the package
    has been defined by "package" statement or some entries have been
    created in the symbol table (e.g. "$Foo::var = 1;" will make the "Foo"
    package "exist").

    This function can be used e.g. for checking before aliasing one package
    to another. Or to casually check whether a module has been loaded.

  list_subpackages($name[, $recursive]) => @res
    List subpackages, e.g.:

     (
         "Foo::Bar::Baz",
         "Foo::Bar::Qux",
         ...
     )

    If $recursive is true, will also list subpackages of subpackages, and so
    on.
