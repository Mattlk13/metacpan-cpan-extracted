NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Rinci - Insert stuffs to POD from Rinci metadata

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.785 of Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Rinci
    (from Perl distribution Pod-Weaver-Plugin-Rinci), released on
    2023-03-02.

SYNOPSIS
    In your weaver.ini:

     [-Rinci]
     ;exclude_modules = REGEX
     ;exclude_files = REGEX

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin inserts stuffs to POD documentation based on information
    found on Rinci metadata.

  For modules
    For modules, the following are inserted:

    *   DESCRIPTION

        From "description" property from package metadata, if any.

    *   FUNCTIONS (or METHODS)

        Documentation for each function (or method) for which the metadata
        is found under the package will be added here. For each function,
        there will be summary, description, usage, list of arguments and
        their documentation, as well as examples, according to what's
        available in the function metadata of corresponding function.

    To get Rinci metadata from a module, Perinci::Access::Perl is used.

  For Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI script
    For scripts using Perinci::CmdLine (or its variant ::Any and ::Lite),
    the following are inserted:

    *   SYNOPSIS

        If the script's POD does not yet have this section, this section
        will be added containing the usage line of the script.

    *   DESCRIPTION

        If the script's POD does not already have this section, and if the
        script does not have subcommands, description from function metadata
        will be inserted here, if any.

    *   SUBCOMMANDS

        If the script's POD does not already have his section, and if the
        script has subcommands, then each subcommand will be listed here
        along with its summary and description.

    *   OPTIONS

        If the script's POD does not already have his section, command-line
        options for the script will be listed here. If script has
        subcommands, the options will be categorized per subcommand.

    *   CONFIGURATION

        If the script's POD does not already have his section, general
        information about configuration files and available configuration
        parameters will be listed here. If script has subcommands, the
        parameters will be categorized per subcommand.

    *   FILES

        Configuration files read by script will be listed here.

    To get Perinci::CmdLine object information (which contains the URL of
    the Rinci function, or the list of subcommands, among others), the
    script is run with a patched "run()" that will dump the content of the
    object and exit immediately, so the plugin can inspect it.

    Caveats: 1) Function used by the script must reside in the module, not
    embedded inside the script itself, otherwise it will not be readable by
    the plugin. 2) Coderef "subcommands" is not supported.

    To exclude a script from being processed, you can also put "#
    NO_PWP_RINCI" in the script.

CONFIGURATION
  exclude_modules
    String, a regex.

  exclude_files
    String, a regex.

  use_require_hook_source_dzilbuild
    Bool, default true.

    Since weaver.ini does not provide something like @Filter in dist.ini,
    you can also use the environment variable
    "PERL_POD_WEAVER_PLUGIN_RINCI_USE_REQUIRE_HOOK_SOURCE_DZILBUILD" to set
    the default value of this configuration option.

  force_reload
    Bool, default true.

    Whether to force reloading modules, to get the latest version (e.g. a
    module is already loaded by another plugin but then might get modified;
    when we are processing the module we might want to reload to get the
    latest version.

    But this reloading sometimes causes the module to fail to compile, so
    this option exists.

    Since weaver.ini does not provide something like @Filter in dist.ini,
    you can also use the environment variable
    "PERL_POD_WEAVER_PLUGIN_RINCI_FORCE_RELOAD" to set the default value of
    this configuration option.

ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_POD_WEAVER_PLUGIN_RINCI_USE_REQUIRE_HOOK_SOURCE_DZILBUILD
    Bool. Used to set the default for the
    "/use_require_hook_source_dzilbuild" configuration option.

  PERL_POD_WEAVER_PLUGIN_RINCI_FORCE_RELOAD
    Bool. Used to set the default for the "/force_reload" configuration
    option.

  PERL_POD_WEAVER_PLUGIN_RINCI_EXCLUDE_MODULES
    String (regex pattern). Used to set the default value for the
    "/exclude_modules" configuration option.

  PERL_POD_WEAVER_PLUGIN_RINCI_EXCLUDE_FILES
    String (regex pattern). Used to set the default value for the
    "/exclude_files" configuration option.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
