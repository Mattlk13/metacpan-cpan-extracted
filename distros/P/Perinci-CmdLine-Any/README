NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::Any - Choose Perinci::CmdLine implementation (::Lite
    or ::Classic)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.154 of Perinci::CmdLine::Any (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-Any), released on 2022-10-19.

SYNOPSIS
    In your command-line script (this will pick ::Lite first):

     #!perl
     use Perinci::CmdLine::Any;
     Perinci::CmdLine::Any->new(url => '/Package/func')->run;

    In your command-line script (this will pick ::Classic first, and falls
    back to ::Lite):

     #!perl
     use Perinci::CmdLine::Any -prefer_lite=>0;
     Perinci::CmdLine::Any->new(url => '/Package/func')->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you use Perinci::CmdLine::Lite or
    Perinci::CmdLine::Classic.

    If you want to force using a specific class, you can set the
    "PERINCI_CMDLINE_ANY" environment variable, e.g. the command below will
    only try to use Perinci::CmdLine::Classic:

     % PERINCI_CMDLINE_ANY=Perinci::CmdLine::Classic yourapp.pl
     % PERINCI_CMDLINE_ANY=classic yourapp.pl

    If you want to prefer to Perinci::CmdLine::Classic (but user will still
    be able to override using "PERINCI_CMDLINE_ANY"):

     use Perinci::CmdLine::Any -prefer_lite => 0;

ENVIRONMENT
  PERINCI_CMDLINE_ANY => str
    Either specify module name, or "lite" or "classic".

    Perinci::CmdLine::Any since it works by generating script instead:

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
