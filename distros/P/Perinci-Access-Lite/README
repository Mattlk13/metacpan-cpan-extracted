NAME
    Perinci::Access::Lite - A lightweight Riap client library

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.150 of Perinci::Access::Lite (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Access-Lite), released on 2022-10-28.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a lightweight alternative to Perinci::Access. It has less
    prerequisites but does fewer things. The things it supports:

    *   Local (in-process) access to Perl modules and functions

        Currently only "call", "meta", and "list" actions are implemented.
        Variables and other entities are not yet supported.

        The "list" action only gathers keys from %SPEC and do not yet list
        subpackages.

    *   HTTP/HTTPS

    *   HTTP over Unix socket

    Differences with Perinci::Access:

    *   For network access, uses HTTP::Tiny module family instead of LWP

        This results in fewer dependencies. HTTP::Tiny (and
        HTTP::Tiny::UNIX) are even specified as runtime recommends
        dependencies instead of runtime requires, so if your script or
        downstream library requires HTTP access, you'll need to specify the
        dependencies explicitly.

    *   No wrapping, no argument checking

        For 'pl' or schemeless URL, no wrapping (Perinci::Sub::Wrapper) is
        done, only normalization (using Perinci::Sub::Normalize).

    *   No transaction or logging support

    *   No support for some schemes

        This includes: Riap::Simple over pipe/TCP socket.

ADDED RESULT METADATA
    This class might add the following property/attribute in result
    metadata:

  x.hint.result_binary => bool
    If result's schema type is "buf", then this class will set this
    attribute to true, to give hints to result formatters.

ATTRIBUTES
  riap_version => float (default: 1.1)
METHODS
  new(%attrs) => obj
  $pa->request($action, $url, $extra) => hash

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
