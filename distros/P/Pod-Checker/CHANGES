 Version 1.74
 + CPAN#133312: Add strict compliance to Pod-Checker
   Thanks TODDR for the patch to make the code "use strict" compliant
 + CPAN#98326: Can we make “A non-empty Z<>” a warning and not an error
   This is a corner case... and since Pod::Simple anyway "nixes" anything
   inside Z<...>, this is a warning, not an error. Mind the caveats.
 + Added an additional test to achieve 100% statement coverage and added
   some POD to also have 100% POD coverage
 + Made all text files unixish, no CRLF

 Version 1.73
 + CPAN#114623: Changes file gives wrong date for 1.72

 Version 1.72

   distro is in sync with core Perl again
 + CPAN#102526: License declaration mismatch
   made this distro licensed like Perl itself
 + CPAN#104857: META.json version ne dist version
   attempt to clean up META.yml and META.json

 Version 1.71
 + rephrased the NAME section as suggested by Neil in CPAN#93145
 + applied patches from TONYC (CPAN#96199)
 + one minor change to make this work again with 5.8; may as well work

   Makefile.PL and removed the use 5.14 from Checker.pm

 Version 1.70
