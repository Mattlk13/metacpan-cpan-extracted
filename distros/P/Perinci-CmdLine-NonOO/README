SYNOPSIS

     use Perinci::CmdLine::NonOO qw(run_cmdline_app);
     run_cmdline_app(url => '/Foo/bar');

    which is equivalent to:

     use Perinci::CmdLine::Lite;
     my $cli = Perinci::CmdLine::Lite->new(url => '/Foo/bar');
     $cli->run;

STATUS

    Experimental, proof of concept.

DESCRIPTION

    Perinci::CmdLine (or its alternatives Perinci::CmdLine::Lite,
    Perinci::CmdLine::Any) is a command-line application framework. It
    "exports" your functions as a CLI application. However,
    Perinci::CmdLine itself has an OO interface, which can be seen as
    ironic. This module is an attempt to fix this. It's basically a thin
    functional interface wrapper over Perinci::CmdLine::Lite.

    Because I'm lazy, it currently uses Perinci::Sub::Gen::FromClass and
    adds a bit of startup overhead. If you're concerned with startup
    overhead, you should use Perinci::CmdLine::Lite directly.
