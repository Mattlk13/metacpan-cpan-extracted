=head1 NAME

peri-eg-multi-any - Test command with multiple subcommands

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.070 of peri-eg-multi-any (from Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-Bin-Any), released on 2020-04-29.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % peri-eg-multi-any add [--config-path=path | -c]
     [--config-profile=profile | -P] [--format=name] [--json]
     [--(no)naked-res] [--no-config | -C] [--no-env]
     [--page-result[=program]] <arg1> <arg2>
 % peri-eg-multi-any subtract [--config-path=path | -c]
     [--config-profile=profile | -P] [--format=name] [--json]
     [--(no)naked-res] [--no-config | -C] [--no-env]
     [--page-result[=program]] <arg1> <arg2>

=head1 SUBCOMMANDS

=head2 B<add>

A function to add to ints.

Just a dummy description. Just a dummy description. Yup, just a dummy
description. Just a dummy description. Just a dummy description. Yeah, just a
dummy description. Just a dummy description.


=head2 B<subtract>

A function to subtract to ints.

This function also has result_naked and args_as set to array.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Common options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--subcommands>

List available subcommands.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=item B<--arg1>=I<s>*, B<-a>

=item B<--arg2>=I<s>*, B<-b>

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C peri-eg-multi-any peri-eg-multi-any

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete peri-eg-multi-any 'p/*/`peri-eg-multi-any`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/peri-eg-multi-any.conf>, F<~/peri-eg-multi-any.conf>, or F</etc/peri-eg-multi-any.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

To put configuration for a certain subcommand only, use a section name like C<[subcommand=NAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=NAME]>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
