=head1 NAME

peri-eg-test-completion-any - Do nothing, return args

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.06 of peri-eg-test-completion-any (from Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-Bin-Any), released on 2015-09-09.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % peri-eg-test-completion-any [options] [i1] [a1]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function is used to test argument completion.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--a1-json>=I<s>

Array of strings, where the string has "in" schema clause (JSON-encoded).

See C<--a1>.

=item B<--a1>=I<s@>

Array of strings, where the string has "in" schema clause.

Completion library can perhaps complete from the `in` value and remember
completed items when command-line option is repeated, e.g. in:

    --a1 <tab>

it will complete from any `in` value, but in:

    --a1 apple --a1 <tab>

it can exclude `apple` from the completion candidate.

Currently the completion library `Perinci::Sub::Complete` does not do this
though. Perhaps there can be an option to toggle this behavior.


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--a2-json>=I<s>

Array with element_completion routine that generate random letter (JSON-encoded).

See C<--a2>.

=item B<--a2>=I<s@>

Array with element_completion routine that generate random letter.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--a3-json>=I<s>

Array with element_completion routine that dies (JSON-encoded).

See C<--a3>.

=item B<--a3>=I<s@>

Array with element_completion routine that dies.

See also `s3`.


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--arg0-json>=I<s>

Argument without any schema (JSON-encoded).

See C<--arg0>.

=item B<--arg0>=I<s>

Argument without any schema.

=item B<--f0>=I<f>

Float with just "float" schema defined.

=item B<--f1>=I<f>

Float with xmin/xmax on the schema.

A completion library can attempt to provide some possible and incremental
completion (e.g. if word is currently at one decimal digit like 1.2, it can
provide completion of 1.20 .. 1.29).


=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--i0>=I<i>

Integer with just "int" schema defined.

=item B<--i1>=I<i>

Integer with min/xmax on the schema.

A completion library (like `Perinci::Sub::Complete`) can generate a list of
completion from the low end to the high end of the range, as long as it is not
too long.


=item B<--i2>=I<i>

Integer with large range min/max on the schema.

Unlike in `i1`, a completion library probably won't generate a number sequence
for this argument because they are considered too long (1000+ items).


=item B<--s1>=I<s>

String with possible values in "in" schema clause.

Valid values:

 ["apple","apricot","banana","grape","grapefruit","red date","red grape","green grape"]

=item B<--s1b>=I<s>

String with possible values in "in" schema clause, contains special characters.

Valid values:

 ["space: ","word containing spaces","single-quote: '","double-quote: \"","slash/","back\\slash","tab\t","word:with:colon","dollar \$sign","various parenthesis: [ ] { } ( )","tilde ~","backtick `","caret^","at\@","pound#","percent%","ampersand&","question?","wildcard*","comma,","semicolon;","pipe|","redirection > <","plus+"]

This argument is intended to test how special characters are escaped.


=item B<--s2>=I<s>

String with completion routine that generate random letter.

=item B<--s3>=I<s>

String with completion routine that dies.

Completion should not display error (except perhaps under debugging). It should
just provide no completion.


=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C peri-eg-test-completion-any peri-eg-test-completion-any

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete peri-eg-test-completion-any 'p/*/`peri-eg-test-completion-any`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 PERI_EG_TEST_COMPLETION_ANY_OPT => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/peri-eg-test-completion-any.conf>, C<~/peri-eg-test-completion-any.conf> or C</etc/peri-eg-test-completion-any.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 a1 (see --a1)
 a2 (see --a2)
 a3 (see --a3)
 arg0 (see --arg0)
 f0 (see --f0)
 f1 (see --f1)
