This archive contains the uHTML library. uHTML is an elegant way to extend HTML
by defining new tags according to the requirements of a particular website.
It allows to connect tags with code chunks and insert function results into
the tag attributes. It is irrelevant if a tag is part of a regular tag set
or means an extension of it. A function connected to a tag can leave it unchanged,
modify it, replace it with a generated content or skip it completely.

Please check the documentation included with the files and http://www.uhtml.de
for installation instructions and bindings to webservers.

It is allowed to use this library under the actual GNU LGPL.
