The tests are running the follwing way:

01compile.t	ensures everything is valid perl
02create_pkgs.t	builds the various RPMs needed by the others tests
cfg.t		tests reading/writing the config files
pod.t		check for POD errors in files (optional)

you need to be root to run superuser--*.t,
with a normal user those tests are simply skipped.

They actually test both urpmi _and_ *rpm* extensively.
It had often find regressions in rpm itself that rpm's own testsuite didn't found.

superuser--file-conflicts.t runs only some patches on Mageia due to having a
downstream patch there

superuser--mirrorlist.t will only be run on Mageia as it needs a specific patch
that introduces Time::ZoneInfo->current_zone()

use "make testall"
