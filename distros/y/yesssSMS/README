yesssSMS version 2.20
=====================

Objects of the yesssSMS class are only able to send text messages to
mobile phones through the website of yesss! (Kontomanager). Kontomanager
might also be in use by other providers (probably Georg, Krone und Kurier, but
this is not tested). Adopting yesssSMS for the use with other providers might
be simple, feel free to contact me if you are willing to try.
To be able to use this service, you need to have an account at yesss!
(a mobile phone). The target phone number must be provided with the
international code starting with 00 (e.g. 0043 for Austria).
