Yandex-Dictionary version 0.02
==============================

DESCRIPTION

The API is used for getting detailed dictionary entries from the static 
Yandex.Dictionary. Unlike conventional translation dictionaries, it is 
compiled automatically using the technologies at the root of the Yandex 
machine translation system. Yandex.Dictionary entries include the word’s 
part of speech, and translations are grouped with examples. For English words, 
the transcription is provided. The service supports a total of 17 language pairs.

Note also that the “Yandex Terms of Use of API Yandex.Dictionary Service”
at https://yandex.com/legal/translate_api/ must be observed.
