=head1 NAME

yars_exercise - Exercise a Yars server from the client side

=head1 VERSION

version 0.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % yars_exercise [log options] [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command provides performance testing for L<Yars>.  Forks a number
of processes and sends requests to the Yars server, using randomly
generated files.  Produces a report with the average C<PUT>, C<GET>
and C<DELETE> times.

All actions are performed through L<Yars::Client>.  It uses the
L<upload|Yars::Client#upload>, L<download|Yars::Client#download>
and L<remove|Yars::Client#remove> methods.

For each client, it randomly shuffles the order of uploads, downloads, and
removes.  The only guarantee is that for each individual file, the first
action is an upload and the last is a remove.  With multiple processes,
this can cause the various operations to intermingle.

Uses L<Log::Log4perl> and L<Clustericious::Log::CommandLine>, so you can specify
any logging options they support, e.g. C<--debug root> will log a note
with the elapsed time for each action, C<--trace Yars::Client> will log
detailed trace log messages from the client, etc.

=head1 OPTIONS

This command also recognizes all options supported by
L<Clustericious::Log::CommandLine>.

=head2 --numclients I<n>

The number of processes to fork.

=head2 --files I<n>

The number of random files to produce.

=head2 --size I<size>

The size of the files.  You can use any suffix supported by
L<Number::Bytes::Human>.

=head2 --gets I<n>

The number of GETs to perform for each client.

=head2 --runs I<filename>

Put your config options in a YAML file and specify it
with "--runs" or "-r":

 % cat runs_desc.yml
 ---
 clients: [2,4]
 files: [5,10]
 gets: [10,20,40,80]
 size: [256,256K,8M]

If you list more than one option, it iterates through various
parameters listed.

C<--runs> also outputs CSV of stats from each run.

=head2 --chunksize I<size>

Chunksize is only used for creating the temp files, changing it won't
affect the Yars actions.  You can use any suffix supported by
L<NumbeR::Bytes::Human>

=head2 --help

Display help for this command.

=head2 --version

Prints the L<Yars> version.
