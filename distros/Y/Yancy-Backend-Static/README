Yancy::Backend::Static

This Yancy::Backend allows Yancy to work with a site made up of Markdown
files with YAML frontmatter, like a Statocles site. In other words, this
module works with a flat-file database made up of YAML + Markdown files.

  Schemas

You should configure the "pages" schema to have all of the fields that
could be in the frontmatter of your Markdown files. This is JSON Schema
and will be validated, but if you're using the Yancy editor, make sure
only to use the types Yancy supports.

  Limitations

This backend should support everything Yancy::Backend supports, though
some list() queries may not work (please make a pull request).

  Future Developments

This backend could be enhanced to provide schema for static files (CSS,
JavaScript, etc...) and templates.
