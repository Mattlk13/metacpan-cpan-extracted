ToDo:

- Load globs
- Dump *foo{IO} and *foo{FORMAT}
- Rewrite documentation
- Copy all relevant code from YAML::Syck
  - Review YAML::Syck Changes file
- Make YAML a prereq for YAML-LibYAML
- Make loading regexp use code from YAML::Types
- Make glob dumping use YAML::Node
- Move all YAML and YAML::XS tests to YAML::Tests
  - Make YAML and YAML::XS pass all common tests
- Add scalar dumping heuristics similar to YAML.pm

Tests:
- Abstract all tests to YAML::Tests
- http://svn.ali.as/cpan/concept/cpan-yaml-tiny/

Profiling:
- TonyC: sprof if I can remember the way to enable shared library profiling
- TonyC: LD_PROFILE, but that may not work on OS X
- TonyC: sample or Sampler.app on OS X, I'd guess
