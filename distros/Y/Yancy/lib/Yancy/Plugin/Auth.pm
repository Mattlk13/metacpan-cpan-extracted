#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod B<Note:> This module is C<EXPERIMENTAL> and its API may change before
#pod Yancy v2.000 is released.
#pod
#pod This plugin adds authentication to your site.
#pod
#pod Multiple authentication plugins can be added with this plugin. If you
#pod only ever want to have one type of auth, you can use that auth plugin
#pod directly if you want.
#pod
#pod =head1 CONFIGURATION
#pod
#pod This plugin has the following configuration options.
#pod
#pod =head2 schema
#pod
#pod The name of the Yancy schema that holds users. Required.
#pod
#pod =head2 username_field
#pod
#pod The name of the field in the schema which is the user's identifier.
#pod This can be a user name, ID, or e-mail address, and is provided by the
#pod user during login.
#pod
#pod =head2 password_field
#pod
#pod The name of the field to use for the password or secret.
#pod
#pod =head2 plugin_field
#pod
#pod The field to store which plugin the user is using to authenticate. This
#pod field is only used if two auth plugins have the same username field.
#pod
#pod =head2 plugins
#pod
#pod An array of auth plugins to configure. Each plugin can be either a name
#pod (in the C<Yancy::Plugin::Auth::> namespace) or an array reference with
#pod two elements: The name (in the C<Yancy::Plugin::Auth::> namespace) and a
#pod hash reference of configuration.
#pod
#pod Each of this module's configuration keys will be used as the default for
#pod all the other auth plugins. Other plugins can override this
#pod configuration individually. For example, users and tokens can be stored
#pod in different schemas:
#pod
#pod     app->yancy->plugin( 'Auth' => {
#pod         plugins => [
#pod             [
#pod                 'Password',
#pod                 {
#pod                     schema => 'users',
#pod                     username_field => 'username',
#pod                     password_field => 'password',
#pod                     password_digest => { type => 'SHA-1' },
#pod                 },
#pod             ],
#pod             [
#pod                 'Token',
#pod                 {
#pod                     schema => 'tokens',
#pod                     token_field => 'token',
#pod                 },
#pod             ],
#pod         ],
#pod     } );
#pod
#pod =head2 Single User / Multiple Auth
#pod
#pod To allow a single user to configure multiple authentication mechanisms, do not
#pod configure a C<plugin_field>. Instead, give every authentication plugin its own
#pod C<username_field>. Then, once a user has registered with one auth method, they
#pod can log in and register with another auth method to link to the same account.
#pod
#pod =head2 Sessions
#pod
#pod This module uses L<Mojolicious
#pod sessions|https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Controller#session>
#pod to store the login information in a secure, signed cookie.
#pod
#pod To configure the default expiration of a session, use
#pod L<Mojolicious::Sessions
#pod default_expiration|https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Sessions#default_expiration>.
#pod
#pod     use Mojolicious::Lite;
#pod     # Expire a session after 1 day of inactivity
#pod     app->sessions->default_expiration( 24 * 60 * 60 );
#pod
#pod =head1 TEMPLATES
#pod
#pod =head2 yancy/auth/login.html.ep
#pod
#pod This displays all of the login forms for all of the configured plugins
#pod (if the plugin has a login form).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Note:> This module is C<EXPERIMENTAL> and its API may change before
Yancy v2.000 is released.

This plugin adds authentication to your site.

Multiple authentication plugins can be added with this plugin. If you
only ever want to have one type of auth, you can use that auth plugin
directly if you want.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 current_user

Returns the currently logged-in user, if any.

=head2 plugins

Returns the list of configured auth plugins.

=head2 login_form

Render the login form template for inclusion in L<Yancy::Plugin::Auth>.

=head2 require_user

    my $subref = $c->yancy->auth->require_user( \%match );

Build a callback to validate there is a logged-in user, and optionally
that the current user has certain fields set. C<\%match> is optional and
is a L<SQL::Abstract where clause|SQL::Abstract/WHERE CLAUSES> matched
with L<Yancy::Util/match>.

    # Ensure the user is logged-in
    my $user_cb = $app->yancy->auth->require_user;
    my $user_only = $app->routes->under( $user_cb );

    # Ensure the user's "is_admin" field is set to 1
    my $admin_cb = $app->yancy->auth->require_user( { is_admin => 1 } );
    my $admin_only = $app->routes->under( $admin_cb );

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This plugin has the following configuration options.

=head2 schema

The name of the Yancy schema that holds users. Required.

=head2 username_field

The name of the field in the schema which is the user's identifier.
This can be a user name, ID, or e-mail address, and is provided by the
user during login.

=head2 password_field

The name of the field to use for the password or secret.

=head2 plugin_field

The field to store which plugin the user is using to authenticate. This
field is only used if two auth plugins have the same username field.

=head2 plugins

An array of auth plugins to configure. Each plugin can be either a name
(in the C<Yancy::Plugin::Auth::> namespace) or an array reference with
two elements: The name (in the C<Yancy::Plugin::Auth::> namespace) and a
hash reference of configuration.

Each of this module's configuration keys will be used as the default for
all the other auth plugins. Other plugins can override this
configuration individually. For example, users and tokens can be stored
in different schemas:

    app->yancy->plugin( 'Auth' => {
        plugins => [
            [
                'Password',
                {
                    schema => 'users',
                    username_field => 'username',
                    password_field => 'password',
                    password_digest => { type => 'SHA-1' },
                },
            ],
            [
                'Token',
                {
                    schema => 'tokens',
                    token_field => 'token',
                },
            ],
        ],
    } );

=head2 Single User / Multiple Auth

To allow a single user to configure multiple authentication mechanisms, do not
configure a C<plugin_field>. Instead, give every authentication plugin its own
C<username_field>. Then, once a user has registered with one auth method, they
can log in and register with another auth method to link to the same account.

=head2 Sessions

This module uses L<Mojolicious
sessions|https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Controller#session>
to store the login information in a secure, signed cookie.

To configure the default expiration of a session, use
L<Mojolicious::Sessions
default_expiration|https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Sessions#default_expiration>.

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    # Expire a session after 1 day of inactivity
    app->sessions->default_expiration( 24 * 60 * 60 );

=head1 TEMPLATES

=head2 yancy/auth/login.html.ep

This displays all of the login forms for all of the configured plugins
(if the plugin has a login form).

=head2 layouts/yancy/auth.html.ep

The layout that Yancy uses when displaying the login form, the
unauthorized error message, and other auth-related pages.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Multiplex Plugins

These are possible Auth plugins that can be used with this plugin (or as
standalone, if desired).
