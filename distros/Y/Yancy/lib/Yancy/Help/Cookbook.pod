=head1 How can I limit which schemas and fields a user can edit inside the Yancy editor?

Create another instance of the Yancy editor using
L<Yancy::Plugin::Editor>, passing in a new route, a moniker, and the
exact schemas and fields you want to allow.

    # Allow content editors to only edit the title, content, and
    # content_html of blog posts
    my $schema = app->yancy->schema;
    my $editable_properties = {
        %{ $schema->{blog_posts}{properties} }{qw(
            blog_post_id title content content_html
        )},
    };
    app->yancy->plugin( Editor => {
        backend => app->yancy->backend,
        route => '/edit',
        require_user => {
            -bool => 'is_editor',
        },
        schema => {
            blog_posts => {
                %{ $schema->{blog_posts} },
                properties => $editable_properties,
            },
        },
    } );

See L<https://github.com/preaction/Yancy/tree/eg/limited-editor> for the
complete example.
