NAME
    isa - isn't the isa operator

SYNOPSIS
      use isa 'HTTP::Tiny';
  
      my $obj = MyApp->get_user_agent;
  
      if ( isa_HTTP_Tiny $obj ) {
        my $response = $obj->get( 'https://www.example.com/' );
        MyApp->do_something( $response );
      }

DESCRIPTION
    The new `isa` operator in Perl 5.32 is pretty great, but if you need to
    support legacy versions of Perl, you can't use it yet. This module gives
    you isa-like functions you can use in Perl 5.6 and above.

    If you've got Type::Tiny::XS installed, you will probably find that this
    module is *faster* than the native `isa` operator!

    The functions exported respect inheritance and allow classes to override
    their `isa` method as you'd expect.

IMPORT
    You need to list the classes you'll be using on the `use` line.

      use isa 'HTTP::Tiny', 'MyApp::Person';

    This module will replace the "::" bits with underscores, and prefix "isa_"
    to each name to create functions like `isa_HTTP_Tiny` and
    `isa_MyApp_Person`.

  Alternative Style
    If you'd prefer to pick your own names for the imported functions, you can
    use a hashref in the import:

      use isa {
        isa_Browser => 'HTTP::Tiny',
        isa_Person  => 'MyApp::Person',
      };
