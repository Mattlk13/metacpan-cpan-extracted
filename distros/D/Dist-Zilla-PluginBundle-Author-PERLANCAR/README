NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR - Dist::Zilla like
    PERLANCAR when you build your dists

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.603 of
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-PERLANCAR), released on 2020-09-27.

SYNOPSIS
     # dist.ini
     [@Author::PERLANCAR]

    is equivalent to (see source).

DESCRIPTION
    The gist:

    I avoid stuffs that might change line numbers (so OurPkgVersion instead
    of PkgVersion, etc). I also always add #ABSTRACT, #PODNAME, and POD at
    the end of file).

    I still maintain dependencies and increase version number manually (so
    no AutoVersion and AutoPrereqs).

    I install my dists after release (the eat-your-own-dog-food principle),
    except when INSTALL=0 environment is specified. I also archive them
    using a script called "archive-perl-release". This is currently a script
    on my computer, you can get them from my 'scripts' github repo but this
    is optional and the release process won't fail if the script does not
    exist.

    There are extra stuffs related to Rinci, which should have no effect if
    you are not using any Rinci metadata in the code.

    There are extra stuffs related to checking prerequisites: I have a
    blacklist of prerequisites to avoid so [Acme::CPANModules::Blacklist]
    will fail the build if any of the blacklisted modules are used as a
    prerequisite (unless the prerequisite is explicitly whitelisted by
    [Acme::CPANModules::Whitelist]). I avoid circular dependencies using
    [Prereqs::CheckCircular]. And I also maintain a file called
    pmversions.ini where I put minimum versions of some modules and check
    this using [Prereqs::EnsureVersion].
