DESCRIPTION
    The "[@Starter::Git]" plugin bundle for Dist::Zilla is a subclass of the
    [@Starter] plugin bundle designed to support a Git-based workflow.

    See the Dist::Zilla::Starter guide and the base [@Starter]
    documentation, as this documentation only details the specifics of this
    subclass.

    For one-line initialization of a new "[@Starter::Git]"-based
    distribution, try Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::Starter::Git.

OPTIONS
    "[@Starter::Git]" inherits the options from [@Starter], and can
    similarly be further configured by the composed roles, as in
    "CONFIGURING".

  revision
      [@Starter::Git]
      revision = 5

    As in "revision" in Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Starter, but defaults to
    revision 3. "[@Starter::Git]" requires at least revision 3.

  installer
    As in "installer" in Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Starter.

  managed_versions
    As in "managed_versions" in Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Starter, and
    additionally uses [Git::Commit] a second time after
    [BumpVersionAfterRelease] to commit the bumped versions (with the plugin
    name "Version_Bump_Commit").

  regenerate
    As in "regenerate" in Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Starter, and allows
    changes to the copied files to be committed in the "Release_Commit".

REVISIONS
    The "[@Starter::Git]" plugin bundle supports the following revisions.

  Revision 3
    Revision 3 is the default and is equivalent to using the following
    plugins:

    [Git::GatherDir]
    [MetaYAML]
    [MetaJSON]
    [License]
    [Pod2Readme]
    [PodSyntaxTests]
    [Test::ReportPrereqs]

        xt_mode = 1

    [MakeMaker]
    [Manifest]
    [PruneCruft]
    [ManifestSkip]
    [RunExtraTests]
    [Git::Check]
        allow_dirty = dist.ini
        allow_dirty = Changes

    [TestRelease]
    [ConfirmRelease]
    [UploadToCPAN]
    [Git::Commit / Release_Commit]
        allow_dirty = dist.ini
        allow_dirty = Changes
        add_files_in = /
        commit_msg = %v%n%n%c

    [Git::Tag]
        tag_format = %v
        tag_message = %v

    [Git::Push]
    [MetaConfig]
    [MetaNoIndex]
        directory = t
        directory = xt
        directory = inc
        directory = share
        directory = eg
        directory = examples

    [MetaProvides::Package]
        inherit_version = 0

    [ShareDir]
    [ExecDir]

    This revision differs from Revision 3 in [@Starter] as follows:

    * Uses [Git::GatherDir] instead of [GatherDir].

    * Includes the following additional plugins: [Git::Check],
      [Git::Commit], [Git::Tag], [Git::Push].

    Revision 4 has no specific differences beyond the changes in Revision 4
    in [@Starter].

  Revision 5

    in [@Starter].
