NAME
    Data::TableData::Object - Manipulate data structure via table object

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.114 of Data::TableData::Object (from
    Perl distribution Data-TableData-Object), released on 2021-11-17.

FUNCTIONS
  table
    Usage:

     my $obj = table($data[ , $spec ]); # => obj

    Shortcut for "Data::TableData::Object->new(...)".

METHODS
  new
    Usage:

     my $obj = Data::TableData::Object->new($data[ , $spec ]); # => obj

    Detect the structure of $data and create the appropriate
    "Data::TableData::Object::FORM" object. Note: if $data is already a
    table data object ("isa Data::TableData::Object::Base"), then $data will
    be returned as-is instead of creating a new object.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
