NAME
    Devel::DieHandler::DumpDieArgs - Dump content of die arguments

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Devel::DieHandler::DumpDieArgs
    (from Perl distribution Devel-DieHandler-DumpDieArgs), released on
    2022-10-27.

SYNOPSIS
     % perl -MDevel::DieHandler::DumpDieArgs -e'...'

DESCRIPTION
    When imported, this module installs a "__DIE__" handler which dumps the
    content of @_ to STDERR, then calls the previous handler (or die).
    Useful if your code (accidentally?) throws an unhandled a data structure
    or object exception, which normally just prints "HASH(0x55e20e0fd5e8)"
    or "Foo=ARRAY(0x5566580705e8)".

    Unimporting (via "no Devel::DieHandler::DumpDieArgs") after importing
    restores the previous handler.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
