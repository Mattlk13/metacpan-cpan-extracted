2.0.3     2016-05-06 16:28:48+01:00 Europe/London
    - Fixed buggy encoding on machines giving 20-bit process ids, though
      I fear I may need to do more work here (for now it's ok).
    - The count loses a nybble to accommodate the wider PIDs, keeping the
      id to 96 bits.
    - Added new base64 method for 16-character GUIDs.
2.0.2     2015-10-05 22:50:51+01:00 Europe/London
    - Removed threads dependency. CPANTS failures were from test nodes
      built without threads.
      
    - Allow dev to specify _machine_ident bytes as an alternative to letting
      Net::Address::Ethernet work them out from the machine's MAC address.
      That feature is still there and the default option if the id bytes are
      not already set when _machine_ident is called. Net::Address::Ethernet
      is hamstrung by buggy Net::Ifconfig::Wrapper which doesn't appear to
      be maintained, which is unfortunately a problem on the Travis CI 
      testing resource I use. Bummer!
