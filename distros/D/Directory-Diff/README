This is the README for Directory::Diff version 0.08.

Directory::Diff is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains
four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Directory::Diff - recursively find differences between similar directories

Directory::Diff finds differences between two directories and all
their subdirectories, recursively. If it finds a file with the same
name in both directories, it uses "File::Compare" to find out whether
they are different. It is callback-based and takes actions only if
required.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
website:

    * http://metacpan.org/release/Directory-Diff

(This link goes to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Directory::Diff

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.6.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Directory::Diff

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Directory::Diff

To install the module from the source file, Directory-Diff-0.08.tar.gz,
follow this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Directory-Diff-0.08.tar.gz
    cd Directory-Diff-0.08
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
