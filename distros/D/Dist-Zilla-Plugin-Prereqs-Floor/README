NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::Floor - Dist::Zilla plugin to set a
    minimum allowed version for prerequisites

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        ; in dist.ini

        [Prereqs::Floor]
        File::Temp = 0.19
        Test::More = 0.86

DESCRIPTION
    This prereq provider sets a minimum allowed version for the specified
    modules.

    If the module has been listed as a prerequisite for any phase
    ('runtime', 'test', etc.) or type ('requires', 'recommends', etc.), the
    listed minimum version will be applied to that phase and type.

    The prereqs will only be applied if they already exist. This will not
    add any new prerequisites.

    This prereq provider should run last. Any prerequisites added after it
    runs won't be updated.

SEE ALSO
    *   Prereqs::Upgrade â€“ similar concept with very flexible phase and type
        mapping, but harder to apply universally across all phases/types at
        once
