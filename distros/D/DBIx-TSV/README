NAME
    DBIx::TSV - Generate TSV from SQL query result

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of DBIx::TSV (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-TSV), released on 2018-12-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use DBI;
     use DBIx::TSV;
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", "someuser", "somepass");

    Generating a row of TSV (with header):

     print $dbh->selectrow_tsv("SELECT * FROM member");

    Generating a row of TSV (without header):

    Sample result:

     alice   pvt     123456

    Generating all rows (with header):

     print $dbh->selectall_tsv("SELECT * FROM member");

    Sample result:

     Name    Rank    Serial
     alice   pvt     123456
     bob     cpl     98765321
     carol   brig gen        8745

    Generating all rows (without header):

     print $dbh->selectall_tsv_noheader("SELECT * FROM member");

    Statement handle versions:

     print $sth->fetchrow_tsv;
     print $sth->fetchrow_tsv_noheader;
     print $sth->fetchall_tsv;
     print $sth->fetchall_tsv_noheader;

DESCRIPTION
    This package is a thin glue between DBI and DBIx::TextTableAny (which in
    turn is a thin glue to Text::Table::Any). It adds the following methods
    to database handle:

     selectrow_tsv
     selectall_tsv
     selectrow_tsv_noheader
     selectall_tsv_noheader

    as well as the following methods to statement handle:

     fetchrow_tsv
     fetchall_tsv
     fetchrow_tsv_noheader
     fetchall_tsv_noheader

    The methods send the result of query to Text::Table::Any (using the
    Text::Table::TSV backend) and return the rendered TSV data.

    In essence, this is an easy, straightforward way produce TSV data from
    SQL query.
