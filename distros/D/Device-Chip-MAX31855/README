NAME
    Device::Chip::MAX31855 - chip driver for MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier

SYNOPSIS
        use Device::Chip::MAX31855;
        my $chip = Device::Chip:MAX31855->new;
        $chip->mount(Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new)->get;
    
        my $temp = $chip->read_thermocouple()->get;

DESCRIPTION
    Device::Chip::MAX31855 communicates with the MAX31855 SPI thermocouple
    amplifier.

    The MAX31855 is a digital thermocouple amplifier and converter
    containing a thermocouple measurement circuit, cold junction
    compensator, and digital SPI interface. It provides temperature
    measurements of an attached K-type thermocouple and the local cold
    junction sensor, and can detect faults such as open circuit and short to
    ground (reading faults is not implemented yet).

METHODS
  read_thermocouple
    Returns the termperature of the attached thermocouple in degrees
    Celsius.

  read_cold_junction
    Returns the temperature of the local (cold) junction in degrees Celsius.
