VERSION
    This document describes version 0.101 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertBlock (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertBlock), released on 2021-02-21.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertBlock]

    In lib/Baz.pm:

     ...

     # BEGIN_BLOCK: some_code

     ...

     # END_BLOCK

    In lib/Foo/Base.pm:

     ...

     =head1 ATTRIBUTES

     =for BEGIN_BLOCK: base_attributes

     =head2 attr1

     =head2 attr2

     =for END_BLOCK: base_attributes

     ...

    In lib/Foo/Bar.pm:

     ...

     # INSERT_BLOCK: lib/Baz.pm some_code

     ...

     =head1 ATTRIBUTES

     # INSERT_BLOCK: lib/Foo/Bar.pm base_attributes

     =head2 attr3

     ...

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin finds "# INSERT_BLOCK: <file> <name>" directive in your
    POD/code, find the block of text named *name* in *file*, and inserts the
    block of text to replace the directive.

    Block is marked/defined using either this syntax:

     =for BEGIN_BLOCK: Name

     ...

     =for END_BLOCK: Name

    or this syntax:

     # BEGIN_BLOCK: Name
     ...
     # END_BLOCK: Name

    Block name is case-sensitive.

    This plugin can be useful to avoid repetition/manual copy-paste, e.g.
    you want to list POD attributes, methods, etc from a base class into a
    subclass.

  Options
    The "# INSERT_BLOCK" directive accepts an optional third argument for
    options. Known options:

    *   pod_verbatim

        This option pads each line of the block content with whitespace.
        Suitable for when you are inserting a block into a POD and you want
        to make the content of the block as POD verbatim.
