NAME

    Device::GBA - Perl Interface to the Gameboy Advance

VERSION

    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

        use Device::GBA;
    
        my $gba = Device::GBA->new(buspirate => '/dev/ttyUSB0') or die "No such device!\n";
        $gba->upload('helloworld.gba');

DESCRIPTION

    The Nintendo Gameboy Advance can either boot from cartridge or over
    link cable. The latter is caled multiboot mode and is basically SPI and
    a homebrew encoding scheme. Unfortunately, the Bus Pirate doesn't have
    a 100k SPI mode, so we are using 125k instead. If you encounter
    problems with booting, use the next lower speed (30k) as bitrate. This
    utility allows uploading multiboot GBA images with the BusPirate. Don't
    forget to pass -specs=gba_mb.specs to devkitARM GCC if you want to link
    a multiboot image. The package's share/ subdirectory contains an
    example Makefile
    <https://github.com/athreef/Device-GBA/blob/master/share/testimg/Makefile>
    for cross-compilation. The wiring is as follows:

        GBA     Bus Pirate
        SO  --> MISO
        SI  <-- MOSI
        CLK <-- CLK

    Note: This is still work in progress!

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

    new()

      Opens specified device and returns the corresponding object
      reference. Returns undef if an attempt to open the device has failed.
      Accepts following parameters:

      buspirate

	COM port or handle of the BusPirate connected to the Gameboy

      verbose

	if true, methods on this instance will narrate what they're doing.
	Default is 0.

    upload

          $gba->upload($firmware_file)

      Reads in $firmware_file and uploads it to the Gameboy Advance.

    spi_writeread

          $miso = $gba->spi_writeread($mosi)

      reads and writes 32 bit from the SPI bus.

    crc

          $c = Device::GBA::crc($w, [$c = 0x0000c387])

      Calculates CRC for word $w and CRC $c according to the algrithm used
      by the GBA multiboot protocol.
