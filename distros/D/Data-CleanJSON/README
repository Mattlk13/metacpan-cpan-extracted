     use Data::CleanJSON qw(clean_json_in_place clone_and_clean_json);
    
     clean_json_in_place($data);
     $cleaned = clone_and_clean_json($data);

DESCRIPTION

    This has the same functionality as Data::Clean::JSON except that the
    code to perform the cleaning is pre-generated, so we no longer need
    Data::Clean> during runtime.

FUNCTIONS

    None of the functions are exported by default.

 clean_json_in_place($data)
