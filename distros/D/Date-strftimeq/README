NAME
    Date::strftimeq - POSIX::strftime() with support for embedded perl code
    in %(...)q

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Date::strftimeq (from Perl
    distribution Date-strftimeq), released on 2019-11-20.

SYNOPSIS
     use Date::strftimeq; # by default exports strftimeq()

     my @time = localtime();
     print strftimeq '<%Y-%m-%d>', @time; # <2019-11-19>
     print strftimeq '<%Y-%m-%d%( require Date::DayOfWeek; Date::DayOfWeek::dayofweek($_[3], $_[4]+1, $_[5]+1900) == 0 ? "sun":"" )q>', @time; # <2019-11-19>
     print strftimeq '<%Y-%m-%d%( require Date::DayOfWeek; Date::DayOfWeek::dayofweek($_[3], $_[4]+1, $_[5]+1900) == 2 ? "tue":"" )q>', @time; # <2019-11-19tue>

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides "strftimeq()" which extends POSIX's "strftime()"
    with a conversion: "%(...)q". Inside the parenthesis, you can specify
    Perl code. The Perl code will receive the arguments passed to
    strftimeq() except for the first). The Perl code will be eval-ed in the
    caller's package, without strict and without warnings.

FUNCTIONS
  strftimeq
    Usage:

     $str = strftimeq $fmt, $sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year;
