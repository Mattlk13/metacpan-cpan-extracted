NAME

    Dancer2::Serializer::JSONMaybeXS - (DEPRECATED) Serializer for handling
    JSON data

SYNOPSIS

     use Dancer2;
     set serializer => 'JSONMaybeXS';

DESCRIPTION

    This is a DEPRECATED serializer engine for the Dancer2 web framework.
    Dancer2 now uses JSON::MaybeXS natively in the default
    Dancer2::Serializer::JSON (as of version 0.201000), so this module is
    no longer needed.
