DESCRIPTION:This talk aims to give/explain some lessons learnt and tips on 
 using\nDBIx::Class with a legacy database schema.\n\nAn overview of DBIx::
 Class will be given\, although this will not be in\ngreat detail and there
  is some expectation of knowledge of the basics\nof dbic\n\nThe basic skel
 eton of the talk is as follows:\n\n        - Who am i?\n        - Why DBIx
 ::Class\n        - Legacy Schema\n                + Grown organically\n   
              + Poorly normalised\n                + No relational constrai
 nts\n                + Polymorphic relationships\n                + Poor c
 hoice of data types\n                + SQL Antipatterns\n        - Battlin
 g the above with DBIx::Class\n                + Generating schema classes\
 n                + Adding relationships\n                + Solving joins o
 n polymorphic relationships\n                + Inflating columns\n        
         + Fixing data types with filters\n                + Virtual views 
 and reports\n                + Query tracing and profiling\n        - Ques
 tions?\n\nOther topics touched upon may include:\n\n        - MVC\n       
          + Thin controllers\n                + Fat model\n\nI expect the t
 alk to last around 45 minutes\, and with a Q&A at the end\nthat should tak
 e it to the 60 minute mark. The full presentation and\nexample code will a
 vailable for view/fork/contribution on github.

DESCRIPTION:With CSV being a dataformat that does not define the variables 
 required to parse it (encoding\, separator- and quotation character)\, we'
 d like to have features that wil (try to) do so for us automatically.\n\nH
 aving third party that ships CSV file sets that mix '\;' and '\,' for sepa
 rators\, UTF-8 and UTF-16LE files and more weirdness that makes one curse\
 , caused me to write a new method that takes care of most of those annoyan
 ces.

DESCRIPTION:Swagger is a specification of a REST API.\nIt is now the base o
 f the Open API Initiative supported by a number of companies\n\nWhat *you*
  have to do:\n* Understand the spec and specify all your API endpoints (pa
 rameters\, input and output schema)\n* Each item of the spec can have a "d
 escription"\n\nWhat does it give you in return:\n* The spec and your descr
 iptions are the public documentation - no need to seperately administrate 
 docs that possibly get out of date\n* A nice javascript frontend for manua
 l testing\, with OAuth2 support\n* A plugin for your web framework (*)\, w
 hich creates the routes and does all the input/output validation\, so you 
 only have to care about the actual business logic.\n* You can write it in 
 YAML\n\n\nYou don't need to write the validation yourself\, but it helps t
 o understand how it is done. I'll show you an example and some pitfalls yo
 u should be aware of.\n\nI created an example git repository I'll use in m
 y talk:\n<https://github.com/perlpunk/dancer-swagger-example-p5>\n\n(*) Cu

 ecification and validation\, help\, documentation\, and advanced shell tab
  completion.\n\n\nGood commandline tools\n* give good usage error messages
 \n* have good usage output\n* have useful shell tab completion\n* have goo
 d man pages\n\nYour CLI framework should do that work for you\, and you sh
 ould not have to write duplicate code/pod.\n\nI'll show a framework that t
 ries to implement all these things\, and some examples to demonstrate how 
 advanced completion can make the life of your users much easier.

DESCRIPTION:After writing an open source novel using Markdown and github\, 
 I have increasingly automatized and streamlined the toolbelt for writing e
 ither literature or technical books using git and GitHub\, with continuous
  integration thrown in for good measure. But this integration affords the 
 quantification of the creative process: every commit and every test result
  scores a diversity of things\, from number of words to text readability a
 nd quality.\nIn this talk I will explain how I managed to reduce the conti
 nuous integration of any text to a few lines in a continuous integration c
 onf file\, and\, at the same time\, what these tests reveal about my own w
 riting process quantitavely and\, a bit\, qualitatively.

DESCRIPTION:Perl Catalyst is a modern MVC (model - view - controller) devel
 opment framework for building the server side of your web application. It 
 has a reputation for being a bit heavyweight\, but the classic design patt
 erns its build upon have time and again demonstrated their worth to those 
 who choose it. These design patterns encapsulate tried and true approaches
  to solve common development problems in ways that are clear\, testable an
 d maintainable. \n\nThis talk covers many of the design patterns built int
 o Catalyst. Design patterns discussed include:\n\n-- Command\n-- Model/Vie
 w/Controller\n-- Chain of Command\n-- Service Location\n-- Inversion of Co
 ntrol\n-- Dependency Injection\n-- Middleware\n-- Proxy\, Decorators and M
 ediators\n\nDiscussions will include examples as well as conversation arou
 nd deficiencies in how Catalyst employs some of these patterns and what yo
 u can do to mitigate. Discussion will include both core Catalyst functiona
 lity and functionality as extended via several components in the extended 
 Catalyst ecosystem on CPAN. Discussion will conclude with thoughts on the 
 future of Catalyst design patterns and where Catalyst might evolve to impr
 oves its already solid support for these classic\, best practice approach 
 to developing maintainable and secure applications.

DESCRIPTION:These Lightning Talks may be serious\, funny\, or both.  They m
 ay be given by experienced speakers already giving full length talks or by
  first time speakers just starting out (this is a great way to get started
  if you have something to say).  If you are a first time speaker you will 
 win a tie with an experience speaker when the schedule is made if it comes
  to it.  Today's first time speaker could be tomorrow's keynote speaker.\n
 \nWe will have about 10 Lightning Talks of 5 minutes each day.  Submit you
 r talk through the submit talk link on this website.  The first deadline i
 s with the full length talks.  The second deadline is one week before the 
 conference starts and many proposals will be accepted.  At least two speak
 ing spots on days 2 and 3 will be held open until the day before the talks
  to give you a chance to see something at the conference and put together 
 a Lightning Talk response.  However if you wait for the later deadlines no
 te that there are fewer spots available and you are less likely to be acce
 pted so please try to submit more than a week before the conference.\n\nIn
  addition to the five minute Lightning Talks where you get to use your com
 puter\, slides\, and any other tool\, we will also have some Lightning Adv
 ertisements.  These are only 30 seconds\, you don't have to submit a propo
 sal\, you don't get any slides\, and the only AV assistance offered is a m
 icrophone.  If you have a BOF to announce\, an auction item so advertise o
 r any other short message you can use the transition time that would be ot
 herwise wasted between Lightning Talks to share your message.  Just show u
 p before we start and take a seat in the assigned seats in the front of th
 e room.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Would You Want to do a Lightning Talk?\n\nMaybe you'v
 e never given a talk before\, and you'd like to start small. For a Lightni
 ng Talk\, you don't need to make slides\, and if you do decide to make sli
 des\, you only need to make three.\n\nMaybe you're nervous and you're afra
 id you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute tal
 k than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up\, at least the 
 painful part will be over quickly.\n\nMaybe you don't have much to say. Ma
 ybe you just want to ask a question\, or invite people to help you with yo
 ur project\, or boast about something you did\, or tell a short cautionary
  story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about\, but the
 re might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.\n\nMay
 be you have a lot of things to say\, and you're already going to give a lo
 ng talk on one of them\, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's 
 nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey\, they're only five
  minutes.\n\nOn the other side\, people might want to come to a lightning 
 talk when they wouldn't come to a long talk on the same subject. The risk 
 for the attendees is smaller: If the talk turns out to be dull\, or if the
  person giving the talk turns out to be a really bad speaker\, well\, at l
 east it's over in five minutes. With lightning talks\, you're never stuck 
 in some boring lecture for forty-five minutes.\n\nStill having trouble pic
 king a topic\, here are some suggestions:\n\n   1. Why my favorite module 
 is X.\n   2. I want to do cool project X. Does anyone want to help?\n   3.
  Successful Project: I did project X. It was a success. Here's how you cou
 ld benefit.\n   4. Failed Project: I did project X. It was a failure\, and
  here's why.\n   5. Heresy: People always say X\, but they're wrong. Here'
 s why.\n   6. You All Suck: Here's what is wrong with the our community.\n
    7. Call to Action: Let's all do more of X / less of X.\n   8. Wouldn't 
 it be cool if X?\n   9. Someone needs to do X.\n  10. Wish List\n  11. Why
  X was a mistake.\n  12. Why X looks like a mistake\, but isn't.\n  13. Wh
 at it's like to do X.\n  14. Here's a useful technique that worked.\n  15.
  Here's a technique I thought would be useful but didn't work.\n  16. Why 
 algorithm X sucks.\n  17. Comparison of algorithms X and Y. \n\nOf course\
 , you could give the talk on anything you wanted\, whether or not it is on
  this list. If we get a full schedule of nothing but five minutes of ranti
 ng and raving on each topic\, a good time will still be had by most.

DESCRIPTION:This talk presents an alternative history of Perl\, in a univer
 se where no-one threw any mugs.\n\nI can't change history. My algorithms (
 and estimates) never run in constant time\, so even if parallel universes 
 exist\, we still can't reach them.\n\nBut what if a parallel universe exis
 ts\, where no-one threw any mugs\, and the Perl 6 project we know had neve
 r started? This talk explores an alternative fictional history\, where a o
 nly a couple of key events turned out differently\, and ponders how things
  evolved\, and whether history converges.\n\nIn this talk we'll learn abou
 t many things in Perl's history\, and contrast Perl's current situation wi
 th analogous dynamic languages and what could have been. Discover the wond
 erful BUFFIE and Cube projects (and how they went wrong)\, and how they ma
 p to the tricky problems in our universe.\n\nBased on more facts™ than you
  might first realise - many things presented as fiction are actually prett
 y much true\, with only the names changed to protect the innocent^Wguilty.
 \n\nResearching this\, I got my hands dirty using CVS and Sourceforge\, so
  that you don't have to. Come and discover the fun things that I learned.

DESCRIPTION:MIR (https://github.com/grubert65/Mir) is a Media Information R
 etrieval System completely built in Perl and still under heavy development
  (I've just started a few months ago and is basically a one-man-project am
 ong many others I carry on). It can fetch and extract text from different 
 sources (web sites\, directories\, emails\,...) and is geared around a dis
 tributed architecture so can easily scale. Currently the platform has been
  used by my company to index some branches of the internal documentation r
 egarding projects and CVs (roughtly 1 million docs).\nThe talk will addres
 s these topics:\n- Distributed architecture design\n- Tips to handle itera
 tive tasks\n- Modern Perl (Moose)\n- Information Retrieval (basics)

DESCRIPTION:How do we document code?\n\nA good solution is to create self-e
 xplanatory code\; this somewhat eliminates the need to document the code. 
 We still need some very basic documentation. Code comments are one form of
  documentation\, that is often misused.\n\nThis talk is about self-explana
 tory code\, the documentation we need and code comment patterns and anti-p
 atterns.

DESCRIPTION:„Make easy things easy and hard things possible”\n    Lary Wall
 \n\n„There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidatio
 n and naming things.”\n   Phill Karlton\n\n\nThe internet and the HTTP spe
 cs were specifically designed to allow responses to be cached. RFC 7234 is
  a 43page long specification on how to do it.\n\nUnfortunately\, there is 
 a whole plethora of modules on CPAN that take the 'easy way' and make cach
 ing and cache invalidation very hard because of poor implementations.\n\nW
 ith Perl\, it is not about "making the first hard thing – cache and invali
 dation – possible" ... let's make it easy!

DESCRIPTION:During the course of a penetration test\, a malware analysis\, 
 a forensic analysis or a Capture The Flag contest\, who has never been in 
 the situation of having to develop \nThe Metabrik Platform [1] goal is to 
 normalize how we use tools and how they interoperate together by providing
  a Platform as a UNIX shell\, merged with a Perl REPL interpreter and a vi
 rtually infinite number of Briks: small reusable components that just do o
 ne task. Learning it is as simple as knowing the five Commands.\n\nYou glu
 e Briks together through the Shell. Idea is to have a set of common bricks
  having their own purpose and connect them to create a new tool or Brik. T
 he more you write Briks\, the more complex tasks you will be able to achie
 ve. Many Briks were written from already existing ones and Metabrik itself
  is written using Briks. In the end\, Metabrik is a development platform w
 hich brings normalization and weaponization for everyday tools\, being new
  or existing ones.\n\nWe will cover forensic::scalpel Brik as an example o
 f improving existing tools by glueing with new Briks. We will then show ho
 w we solved a root-me challenge by using just a few Briks. As another exam
 ple\, we will show VM instrumentation for extracting IOCs from malwares. M
 ore examples are available on the Web site [1] and newest ones will be pre
 sented during the conference thanks to the now more than 200 Briks.\n\n[1]

 Imager:::Trim is a module which extends Imager to be able to automatically
  crop empty space around a photo or picture. It's similar as Imagemagick's
  autocrop\, and it can use so called "fuzziness" adjustment to set how muc
 h variance in the background there can be.\n\nThis talk is about the journ
 ey from theory to practice\, and explaining the steps how the code was eva
 luated to be put into production (e.g. in a service\, which handles hundre

DESCRIPTION:Writing an extension module for Perl in C is tricky: it is easy
  to make a mistake that makes the interpreter catch fire and crash. XS API
  also adds its share of complexity.\n\nRust is a new programming language 
 that has a strong focus on memory safety — preventing bugs that cause memo
 ry corruption and segfaults. It has thin runtime and can produce C-compati
 ble shared libraries\, which makes it suitable for embedding into other pr
 ograms.\n\nRust expressive type system\, macros\, and standard library mak
 e it possible to abstract away many low-level details of XS API. The resul
 t is safer and more friendly API for extending Perl.

DESCRIPTION:Rx is a cross language obfuscator\, helps to obfuscating the co
 de with communication continuity.\n \nA new challenge came to us\, that we
  have to obfuscate a web application had a development of more than two ye
 ars implemented in Perl.PHP\,JS\,HTML\,CSS \,PostgreSQL.\n\nA HTML element
  in form (<input id=”first_name” >)\, validated in JavaScript (document.ge
 tElementById(‘first_name’))\, formatted by element id method in CSS(#first
 _name{..})\, communicated to PHP/Perl ($_POST[‘first_name’]/$CGI->param(‘f
 irst_name’)\, inserted in DB as INSERT INTO table_name(first_name).. and f
 inally send back to HTML by Template Variables(<TMPL_VAR FIRST_NAME>) from
  PHP/Perl. It’s a straight communication\, but the real time usage has var
 iance in different attitudes in implementation subject to the language met
 hods. Now all the “first name” should be replaced by ‘*****’ \n\n\nA chall
 enge and opportunity came together. Initial attempts were taken by commerc
 ial tools and c in Linux environment.  But the cross language usage varian
 ces become a challenge. We unable to treat different things as different t
 hings\, we have to find different usages of single communication and treat
  them similar way to maintain the communication between languages. \n\nIns
 tead of find and replace\, we followed to capture the keys (first_name) in
  various possible contexts\, then index it (1=>first_name) and finally obf
 uscate it (1=>’zxcde’).  It‘s worked better than straight (A=>B) replaceme
 nts.  \nIn this talk\, \n\nwe will share the journey of Rx tool evaluation
  and how the Perl’s Regular Expression and natural expressiveness saved th
 e day.  I will hint on basic usage\, internal structure\, scalability & ex
 tendibility.
