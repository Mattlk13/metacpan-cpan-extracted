<html><body><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 1 <p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> (<em>MMSR</em>) <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> <p>1 <em>Questions</em> regarding the implementation of Regulation ECB/2014/48 <p>1.1 Timeliness <p>1. Given the tight <em>reporting</em> timeframe &ndash; would an extension of the deadline until noon on T+1 be possible or would it be possible to align it with the timeframe for EMIR <em>reporting</em> (by T+1 cob). The tight <em>reporting</em> deadline of 7.00 a.m. CET on T+1 could lead to less accurate data and to a higher number of corrections and thus to a higher <em>reporting</em> burden. In addition, this generates doubts on how a <em>reporting</em> agent would handle transactions conducted after 6.00 p.m. CET. <p>Eurosystem reply: <em>Reporting</em> deadlines reflect internal ECB business needs and processes &ndash; to make the data usable for the daily activities in which the <em>market</em> developments of the previous business day are reviewed and analysed. The timeframe for the transmission of data is set down in Article 4 of Regulation ECB/2014/48. As the deadline for <em>reporting</em> is 7 a.m. CET on T+1 there is sufficient time to capture any transactions concluded after 6 p.m. CET on day T. To reduce the <em>reporting</em> burden, it is also possible to transmit the data at 6 p.m. CET on day T where all of the transactions are concluded before 6 p.m. CET. Furthermore, revisions can be transmitted together with the new daily transactions that are sent to the relevant national central bank (NCB) or the ECB or in a separate file where this is agreed with the respective NCB or the ECB. <p>2. The deadline at 7.00 a.m. T+1 would likely pose processing problems given that there are dependencies on CCP data which is only available post close of business on T. <p>Eurosystem reply: Exceptionally, trades may also be <em>reported</em> back-dated if only booked on the <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s balance sheet on T+1. In the case of tri-party operations using pre-set pools of collateral, the detailed allocated collateral information is not needed as for these trades only the ISIN of the pool is requested. <p>3. If a <em>reporting</em> agent conducts business in different EU time zones, it can happen that trades are booked after 6.00 p.m. CET on T; are these trades to be <em>reported</em> with the trades of T or they could be included in the T+1 <em>reports</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: <em>Reporting</em> must take place between 6 p.m. CET on T and 7 a.m. CET on T+1. Only transactions undertaken/booked by Union and EFTA-located branches will have to be <em>reported</em>. Hence, in the case of transactions concluded after <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 2 <p>6 p.m. CET within the EU time zones, a transmission should still take place by 7 a.m. CET on T+1. <p>4. In case <em>reporting</em> agents <em>report</em> directly to the ECB the cut off time is at 7.00 a.m. CET, while if they <em>report</em> via NCB data should be available to the ECB at 7.00 a.m. CET. Does this mean that the deadline for data transmission will be earlier in case the data are sent to an NCB? If that were the case, it could create difficulties for the <em>reporting</em>. <p>Eurosystem reply: Where a national central bank (NCB) decides to collect data, the time constraint for the <em>reporting</em> agents is decided by the respective NCB. As stated in Article 4(3) of Regulation ECB/2014/48, the NCB will inform the <em>reporting</em> agents of the cut-off time. <p>1.2 Scope of <em>reporting</em> <p>1.2.1 Related to the secured <em>market</em> segment <p>5. Annex 1 of Regulation ECB/2014/48 relates to repo transactions. Could you please provide clarification on whether equity securities lending transactions are within the scope of the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em> framework? <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that if equity lending or borrowing takes place against cash, the transaction must be <em>reported</em>. <p>6. NEW: Most of the equity loans are open and it is not a common <em>market</em> practice to inform a possible future Call date. They are considered as &ldquo;long term&rdquo; instruments. Do they have to be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Here the same logic would apply as for open repos, i.e. the maturity date would be the first date on which the operation can be terminated/ closed (call date). <p>7. The <em>reporting</em> does not appear to cover close-out of open positions so will only cover one leg of the repo transaction. Is this what is intended? <p>Eurosystem reply: This is correct. Close-out of open repos does not need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>8. Can you please confirm that all transactions under GMRA (buy and sell backs) are included under repurchase transactions? Can you please confirm that transactions under GMSLA are out of scope? It is not clear whether Security lending and TCF and/or total return swaps for security finance are included. <p>Eurosystem reply: Buy and sell-back transactions are included in the scope of the <em>reporting</em>. Securities lending is included in the <em>reporting</em> only if it is against cash. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 3 <p>9. If the main activity of a <em>reporting</em> agent with respect to the repo <em>market</em> is on an agency and not on principal basis, the assumption would be that only principal transactions should be <em>reported</em>. Could you please provide clarification in this respect? <p>Eurosystem reply: All transactions booked on the <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s balance sheet meeting the definitions in Regulation ECB/2014/48 need to be <em>reported</em>. We understand that agency transactions are not booked on the <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s balance sheet and therefore they are excluded. <p>10. With respect to repurchase agreements and transactions, do we have to include in the <em>report</em> the securities lending too? <p>Eurosystem reply: Only security lending against cash should be <em>reported</em>. <em>Reporting</em> agents must <em>report</em> all secured transactions (repo and reverse repo) that they are booking under their name with their counterparties. If a repo and a reverse repo are packed together, both operations are <em>reported</em> separately as one lending of cash versus securities and one borrowing of cash versus securities respectively. However, if it is a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; security lending (security against security) this transaction should not be <em>reported</em>; only security lending against cash has to be <em>reported</em>. <p>11. NEW: Securities lending: in case the securities lending transaction is against securities, is clear that there is no <em>reporting</em> of this transaction. However, in some cases, there is in addition a small amount of cash included to align the <em>market</em> value of both securities. Is it correct to assure that these cases should not be <em>reported</em> under <em>MMSR</em>, because the aim of these transactions is receiving a security and not receiving cash? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, this assumption is correct. <p>12. Are PSPP Security Lending transactions which are conducted as repo and reverse repo (with the aim of cash neutrality) <em>reportable</em> under the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em> framework? <p>Eurosystem reply: These transactions are considered securities against cash and as such they need to be <em>reported</em>. Please note that the fee should be <em>reported</em> as the difference in the interest rate of the repo and that of the corresponding reverse repo. <p>13. Open repurchase agreements: Open repos will have a change in maturity date each day. Do <em>reporting</em> agents therefore submit a new transaction each day as a renegotiation? <p>Eurosystem reply: An open repo rollover should be <em>reported</em> as a NEW transaction with the new maturity date and new deal rate. It is expected that these transactions are <em>reported</em> each day when the rollover occurs. For open repos, the maturity date for the <em>reporting</em> agents should be the first date on which the operation can be terminated/closed (call date). <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 4 <p>14. Open repurchase agreements: When <em>reporting</em> an open repo each day as a new transaction, would <em>reporting</em> agents use the original trade date or the date of amendment in the trade date field? <p>Eurosystem reply: <em>Reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> the date on which the rollover (amendment) is agreed and booked. <p>15. Open repurchase agreements: When <em>reporting</em> an open repo each day as a new transaction, what rate should <em>reporting</em> agents use since this is not technically a new repo. Would <em>reporting</em> agents use the original rate or the rate of amendment, i.e. the current day? <p>Eurosystem reply: <em>Reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> the rate of the rollover. <p>16. Open repurchase agreements: If <em>reporting</em> agents are going to send a new trade each day for open maturities, what trade date do they use for <em>reporting</em> and calculations - the original trade date or the current date? <p>Eurosystem reply: <em>Reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> the date on which the rollover (amendment) is agreed and booked. <p>The following examples focus on how to <em>report</em> open repos in terms of maturity dates and deal rates (in these examples, the other fields are deliberately omitted, but would also need to be populated according to the relevant requirements): <p>(a) Example of open repo <em>reporting</em> &ndash; fixed rate which stays unchanged for two consecutive days. <p>Initial trade takes place on 2 December with settlement on 3 December and with first possible termination date on 4 December. <p>On 3 December the trade is rolled over with the same rate and a new first possible termination date on 7 December. The open repo should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p>On 2 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 2 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 4 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Deal Rate&rsquo;: -0.19%; &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 1, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>On 3 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 4 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 7 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Deal Rate&rsquo;: -0.19%; &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 2, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>(b) Example of open repo <em>reporting</em> &ndash; fixed rate which changes. <p>Initial trade takes place on 2 December with settlement on 3 December and with first possible termination date on 4 December. <p>On 3 December the trade is rolled over with a new rate and a new first possible termination date on 7 December. The open repo should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 5 <p>On 2 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 2 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 4 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Deal Rate&rsquo;: -0.19%; &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 1, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>On 3 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 4 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 7 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Deal Rate&rsquo;: -0.17% (as this is the new rate applicable to the open repo which is rolled over); &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 2, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>(c) Example of open repo <em>reporting</em> &ndash; variable rate with unchanged spread. <p>Initial trade takes place on 2 December with settlement on 3 December and with first possible termination date on 4 December. The reference rate index is EONIA. <p>On 3 December the trade is rolled over with the same spread and a new first possible termination date on 7 December. The open repo should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p>On 2 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 2 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 4 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Reference Rate Index&rsquo;: EU0009659945 (this is the ISIN for EONIA); &lsquo;Basis Point Spread&rsquo;: 2; &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 1, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>On 3 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 4 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 7 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Reference Rate Index&rsquo;: EU0009659945 (this is the ISIN for EONIA); &lsquo;Basis Point Spread&rsquo;: 2; &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 2, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>(d) Example of open repo <em>reporting</em> &ndash; variable rate with changing spread. <p>Initial trade takes place on 2 December with settlement on 3 December and with first possible termination date on 4 December. The reference rate index is EONIA. <p>On 3 December the trade is rolled over with a new spread and a new first possible termination date on 7 December. The open repo should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p>On 2 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 2 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 4 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Reference Rate Index&rsquo;: EU0009659945 (this is the ISIN for EONIA); &lsquo;Basis Point Spread&rsquo;: 2; &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 1, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>On 3 December: &lsquo;Trade Date&rsquo;: 3 December; &lsquo;Settlement Date&rsquo;: 4 December; &lsquo;Maturity Date&rsquo;: 7 December (as this is the first possible termination date); &lsquo;Reference Rate Index&rsquo;: EU0009659945 (this is the ISIN for EONIA); &lsquo;Basis Point Spread&rsquo;: 5 (as this is the new spread applicable to the open repo which is rolled over); &lsquo;Proprietary Transaction Identification&rsquo;: 2, &lsquo;Transaction Status&rsquo;: NEWT. <p>17. Open repurchase agreements: For an open trade, as the End Date is Open, <em>reporting</em> agents cannot determine what the Deal Rate will be. This will only come in when the transaction is closed. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 6 <p>Eurosystem reply: The initially agreed interest rate applied to the cash borrowed/lent &ndash; i.e. the resulting interest income representing the remuneration &ndash; should be <em>reported</em>. <p>18. Regarding the secured <em>market</em>: In case of amortising underlying should we <em>report</em> the original nominal or the current nominal of the security? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> the collateral amount pledged in the <em>reported</em> transaction &ndash; as at the moment when the deal was executed. There is no need for the amortisation of the underlying to be <em>reported</em>. <p>19. NEW: Are transactions relating to forfeiting within the scope of <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Transactions relating to forfeiting (i.e. corporate lending secured by trade receivables) are not within the scope of the secured segment. Also the payments between banks related to forfeiting do not have to be <em>reported</em>. <p>20. NEW: If the cash leg of a repo transaction is in a foreign currency (and not in euro) but only the collateral is in euro, could you please confirm that this transaction should not be <em>reported</em>? <p>Moreover, if the cash leg is in euro but the collateral is not, the collateral nominal amount needs to be converted into euro (according to the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions); could you please confirm this? <p>Eurosystem reply: We confirm that both assumptions are correct. <p>21. NEW: A strategy composed of several repo trades: should all of them be <em>reported</em>? If so, in which way should they be <em>reported</em>, separately or as an aggregate? And in relation to this example, if the strategy is composed of different repos some of them with maturity over 397 days after settlement &ndash; should any of the repos in scope be <em>reported</em>? On the contrary, if the whole strategy is designed in a time frame over 397 days, should any of the trades contained in it be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: All repos should be <em>reported</em> separately, regardless of whether they are part of a strategy or not. Only <em>MMSR</em>-eligible transactions should be <em>reported</em> &ndash; in that respect, any deals with maturity over 397 days after settlement should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>22. NEW: If a security lending (against cash) is terminated prior to the maturity date and this termination has been executed without payment of a penalty fee, but the collateral has simply been returned to the lender, is this <em>reportable</em> under the <em>MMSR</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: This early termination should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>23. NEW: Are repo transactions collateralised by commodities within the scope of <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, these operations are within its scope. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 7 <p>24. NEW: Should T-bills be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: T-bills alone are outside the scope of Regulation ECB/2014/48. T-bills should only be <em>reported</em> (with their ISIN code) if used as collateral in repo and securities lending operations. <p>1.2.2 Related to the unsecured <em>market</em> segment <p>25. As the <em>reporting</em> of the call accounts/call <em>money</em> has some crucial specifics, could you please provide clarification for the <em>reporting</em> of this type of instruments? <p>Eurosystem reply: Unlike deposits on current accounts, call accounts have to be <em>reported</em> for the unsecured <em>money</em> <em>market</em> segment. For call accounts, the first date on which the instrument may be redeemed must be provided as the maturity date. This is usually the next business day. <p>Following a change to the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions, the fields &lsquo;Call or Put&rsquo; and &lsquo;First Call/Put Date&rsquo; do not have to be <em>reported</em> for call accounts. <p>Should the amount placed on a call account remain the same on the next business day, this is interpreted as a rollover. A rollover is a new transaction (with flag &lsquo;NEWT&rsquo; and a new Proprietary Transaction Identification (PTI)). <p>Therefore, it is mandatory to <em>report</em> every day the outstanding amounts of all call accounts (at the end of the business day) and not the individual changes occurring on the call account during the trade day. Repayments do not have to be <em>reported</em> as separate transactions. <p>See the following example by way of illustration: <p>Day Transaction Amount PTI <p>T New call account 100.000 &bdquo;1&ldquo; <p>T+1 No action, i.e. rollover 100.000 &bdquo;2&ldquo; <p>T+2 Rollover and further increase of the volume by 50.000 150.000 &bdquo;3&ldquo; <p>T+3 Repayment of 120.000 30.000 &bdquo;4&ldquo; <p>T+4 Termination of call account No <em>reporting</em> - <p><p>26. Should the &ldquo;call account&rdquo; instrument type for the unsecured <em>market</em> segment also include collateral cash accounts? If that is the case, how should it be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Collateral cash accounts are not required to be <em>reported</em>. <p>27. Does the definition of <em>reportable</em> instruments include borrower note loans (Schuldscheine)? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, depending on the underwriter of the instrument. If the underwriter is a retail investor, Schuldscheine should not be <em>reported</em>. In all other cases these deals should be <em>reported</em>. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 8 <p>28. Does the definition of <em>reportable</em> instruments include covered bonds (Pfandbriefe)? <p>Eurosystem reply: For unsecured <em>market</em> <em>reporting</em> of short-term securities, <em>reporting</em> agents <em>report</em> their activity in primary <em>markets</em>, not trading on short-term securities in secondary <em>markets</em>. Hence, they would need to <em>report</em> their issuance in primary <em>markets</em> of covered bonds (by definition mortgage pfandbrief) with a maturity of less than 397 days. <p>29. Does the sale/repurchase of securities (with maturity less than 397 days since the settlement date) as part of price management have to be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: The initial sale of securities (primary <em>market</em> activity in commercial papers, certificates of deposit and other types of short-term security) has to be <em>reported</em>. The repurchase of such securities as part of price management should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>30. <em>Reporting</em> is required for deposits and loans. Are those <em>money</em> <em>market</em> deposits and loans or all types of deposits and loans? <p>Eurosystem reply: On the lending side, only transactions conducted with other credit institutions need to be <em>reported</em>. On the borrowing side, along with the transactions conducted with other credit institutions, borrowing from other financial intermediaries (OFIs), insurance corporations, pension funds, central banks (excluding transactions related to Eurosystem tender operations and standing facilities) and general government, as well as transactions with non-financial corporations classified as &lsquo;wholesale&rsquo; under the Basel III LCR framework, also need to be <em>reported</em>. Only <em>money</em> <em>market</em> transactions with a maturity of less than 397 days after the settlement date have to be <em>reported</em>. <p>31. Floating Rate Note (FRN): does this include only papers with original maturity less than one year or could it also include papers with original maturity more than one year but remaining maturity less than one year? <p>Eurosystem reply: Only instruments/papers with original maturity of less than or equal to one year (up to 397 days after the settlement date) should be <em>reported</em>. <p>32. It is mandatory to consider for <em>reporting</em> any purchase on the secondary <em>market</em> of securities issued by a credit institution when the security has a residual maturity up to one year? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, only transactions involving the purchase (or issuance of) a short-term security in the primary <em>market</em> need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>33. Should short term (less than 1 year maturity) fixed deposits with insurance companies and/or pension funds be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, they should be <em>reported</em>. <p>34. In the instrument type description for certificate of deposits, commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper, it is said &ldquo;issued by an MFI&rdquo;. The scope definition <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 9 <p>says &lsquo;lending to other credit institutions (&hellip;) via the purchase from the issuing credit institutions (&hellip;)&rsquo;, but it does not mention that these institutions must be MFIs. Therefore, are &lsquo;lending deals to credit institutions that are not MFIs&rsquo; <em>reportable</em> under Regulation ECB/2014/48? <p>Eurosystem reply: All lending via purchases of short-term securities issued by other credit institutions on the primary <em>market</em> must be <em>reported</em>. All credit institutions are considered to be monetary financial institutions (MFIs) (please refer to the ECB&rsquo;s lists of financial institutions: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/<em>money</em>/mfi/html/index.en.html). <p>35. On the unsecured <em>market</em> segment, are current accounts included into the scope of the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em> framework? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, current accounts are outside the scope of <em>MMSR</em> and should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>36. Could you please clarify whether the selling on secondary <em>market</em> of own securities when the security have a residual maturity of up to one year, should be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, only issuance of short-term securities with an initial maturity of up to one year needs to be <em>reported</em>, but no transactions relating to the secondary <em>market</em>. <p>37. Are re-openings of an issuance considered to be <em>reported</em> and if yes, how? <p>Eurosystem reply: Re-openings are currently outside the scope of <em>MMSR</em> data collection. <p>38. Could you please clarify what should be considered as primary <em>market</em> for the <em>MMSR</em> purposes? <p>Eurosystem reply: Regarding the matter of increases of (existing) issues, primary <em>market</em> transactions will be considered as those involving paper issued and bought at issuance (on the issuance day) directly from the issuer. Typically the accrued interest on such a trade is zero. In that sense, the buyer purchases either from the issuer directly or from a dealer who distributes the paper &ndash; commercial paper for example. The main criterion for identifying the primary <em>market</em> is not only the counterparty (which in the primary <em>market</em> would be the same as the issuing entity) but the absence of accrued interest at the settlement date of the purchase. <p>Moreover, two types of primary <em>market</em> transaction should be <em>reported</em>: <p>(a) At issuance of short-term securities, i.e. borrowing of funds. This excludes buy-back and reselling as these are secondary <em>market</em> trades; and <p>(b) When purchasing short-term securities on the primary <em>market</em> (issued by a counterparty), i.e. lending of funds. This excludes purchase from a third party as this is a secondary <em>market</em> trade. <p><div><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/<em>money</em>/mfi/html/index.en.html"></a></div></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 10 <p>39. Could you please provide some further clarification on the <em>reporting</em> of securities issuances? <p>Eurosystem reply: Short-term securities issuance (with a maturity of up to one year) by the <em>reporting</em> agents as well as underwriting from <em>reporting</em> agents of short- term securities issues by other credit institutions must be <em>reported</em>. Secondary <em>market</em> transactions do not need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>40. Are investment certificates and current accounts of MFIs (debit and credit) within the scope of <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, investment certificates and current accounts of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) are not within the scope of the <em>MMSR</em> framework. <p>41. The Wholesale-Definition refers in general to &quot;deposits&quot;. Which deposits are taken into account in the definition? Are e.g. current accounts included? In addition, the total amount of deposits belonging to one NFC might change every day. Are <em>Reporting</em> Agents therefore expected to check daily, whether transactions with a specific NFC are to be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Under the <em>MMSR</em> framework, the definition of the transactions with non-financial corporations (NFC) to be <em>reported</em> allows for two alternative regimes to be applied in a transitory period: <p>(a) the client internal classification which should be stable over time and comply with the classification for liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) purposes; or <p>(b) the size of the individual transactions with only transactions with a nominal amount above the threshold to be <em>reported</em>. <p>After the transitory period only the client classification will be applied. <p>Hence, there is no need for a daily recalculation of the deposit holdings of the NFCs to determine whether transactions with a given NFC need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>42. NEW: Non-Financial Corporation classified as &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; according to the Basel 3 LCR framework: is it correct that in all deposits of the relevant NFC are taken into account for the amount of EUR 1 million, including especially current accounts? <p>Eurosystem reply: The calculation of aggregate funding and classification of an entity as a wholesale non-financial corporation (NFC) is distinct from the <em>MMSR</em> framework (indeed current accounts are outside the scope of <em>MMSR</em>). <p>However, current accounts should be included for the purpose of the wholesale classification calculation. The aggregate funding exposure of the bank to the small business customer for the purpose of the EUR 1 million threshold is calculated by taking all funds extended to this category of customer into consideration &#x2012; this includes current accounts as they represent liabilities like any other. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 11 <p>43. Asset backed commercial paper: Could you please specify &ldquo;&hellip; backed by some form of collateral&rdquo;? <p>Eurosystem reply: &ldquo;&hellip; some form of collateral &hellip;&rdquo; in the case of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) refers to any type of asset which could be used as collateral. <p>44. NEW: How should bank issues with implicit optionality and the purchase and sale of bonds with optionality (i.e. structured notes) be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Call/put options and the respective call/put dates/notice periods need to be <em>reported</em>; bonds with other optional elements do not need to be <em>reported</em>. The settlement price should be <em>reported</em> net of the option value. <p>45. NEW: Are &ldquo;term deposit&rdquo; within the <em>reporting</em> scope of the unsecured segment; possibly considered &ldquo;as unsecured deposits&rdquo;? <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that &ldquo;term accounts&rdquo; are considered as term deposits and would therefore need to be <em>reported</em> as unsecured deposits. However, when the term accounts are subscribed by retail they are outside the scope of <em>MMSR</em>. <p>46. NEW: In case of unsecured lending, via purchase on the primary <em>market</em>: If the <em>reporting</em> agent purchases such an issuance in the context of Sales activity &ndash; i.e. it buys it for its Institutional Clients and don&rsquo;t keep it on its books &ndash; should this be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, operations conducted on behalf of clients are outside the scope of the <em>MMSR</em> framework. <p>47. NEW: How should a negotiable certificate of deposit, be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: This type of instrument should be <em>reported</em> as a floating rate note. <p>48. NEW: Are convertible bonds within the scope of <em>reporting</em>? Are reverse convertible bonds within the scope of <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Convertible bonds should only be <em>reported</em> if other conditions are met (original maturity of not more than 397 days, issued by the <em>reporting</em> agent or bought from another credit institution). <p>49. NEW: How should shares quoted per unit be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Shares quoted per unit should be <em>reported</em> whenever they match the general <em>reporting</em> criteria. The Transaction Nominal Amount should be <em>reported</em> as &ldquo;number of units multiplied by price per unit&rdquo;. The Transaction Deal Price should be <em>reported</em> as 100 (unless there is an agreement for agio or disagio, i.e. a premium or a discount). <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 12 <p>50. NEW: Could you please confirm that issuances of short-term certificates or notes with equity/equity index underlying are not within the scope of <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: We confirm that this type of instrument is outside the scope of <em>MMSR</em>. <p>51. NEW: Could you please confirm that issuance of a certificate/note which pays a fixed rate to the client (financed by a short put position with no guarantee of capital for the client) is in the scope of <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: On the basis that the negotiated instrument is a certificate of deposit and provided other <em>reporting</em> criteria are met (e.g. as to maturity and counterparty), we confirm that this type of instruments is within the scope of <em>MMSR</em>. <p>52. NEW: Could you please confirm whether zero-coupon bonds should be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Zero-coupon bonds should be <em>reported</em> if they meet <em>reporting</em> criteria. They should be <em>reported</em> as short-term securities. <p>53. NEW: Could you please confirm whether discount certificates and reverse convertibles should be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, these instruments should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>54. NEW: Could you please confirm whether structured products, such as Credit Linked Notes, Share Certificates and CMS Floaters are within the scope of <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: In general, structured products such as those mentioned above are not <em>reportable</em>, as their characteristics do not match the definitions of eligible instruments as contained in the <em>MMSR</em> Regulation and <em>Reporting</em> Instructions. However, please note that if the structured product is in fact just a combination of operations and if any one of these operations is <em>MMSR</em>-eligible, it should be <em>reported</em>. For example, in the case of a borrowing via unsecured transactions which is then hedged via an overnight indexed swap (OIS) trade, both these operations should be <em>reported</em> under the <em>MMSR</em> framework. <p>55. NEW: Should interbank loans be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Interbank loans should be <em>reported</em> as Deposits &ndash; with the relevant features in accordance with the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions. <p>56. NEW: Should structured deposits be <em>reported</em>? More specifically, when a contract/product is specifically identified as a Structured Deposit &ndash; for instance instrumented by a set of derivatives, i.e. IRS+Option, or a deposit linked with a derivative (usually an option). Should the <em>reporting</em> agent provide <p>(a) the complete structure (all deals); or <p>(b) only the deposit within the structure (where there is a deposit) <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 13 <p>Eurosystem reply: Deposits with simple call or put options (or with both) need to be <em>reported</em>. Other, more structured, deposits should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>57. NEW: Should saving accounts (Kapitalsparb&uuml;cher) of non-financial corporations classified as &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; according to the Basel III LCR framework be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that saving accounts (Kapitalsparb&uuml;cher) should be <em>reported</em> daily, analogously to call accounts (please refer to Q&amp;A entry 25) if they are conducted with <em>MMSR</em>-eligible counterparties. In any case, these transactions should not be <em>reported</em> for natural person clients&rsquo; accounts. <p>58. NEW: Should a deposit with a maturity of more than 397 days that is redeemable, with or without a penalty, with a notice of one day, be <em>reported</em>? If yes, should the transaction be <em>reported</em> only once with the final maturity date as MATURITY DATE and the notice period as CALL/PULL NOTICE PERIOD or should it be <em>reported</em> again daily until it is either redeemed or it expires? <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that if the original maturity of the instrument is more than 397 days after the settlement date, this transaction should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>59. NEW: Should increases or decreases in a deposit&rsquo;s balance be <em>reported</em>? If yes, how? <p>Eurosystem reply: It depends. Three cases can be distinguished: <p>(a) if the increase or decrease takes place at the maturity of the original transaction this is a rollover to be <em>reported</em> as a new transaction; <p>(b) if the decrease takes place before the maturity date and is in the nature of an early repayment, this is considered a life-cycle event and should not to be <em>reported</em>; <p>(c) if the increase takes place before the maturity of the original deposit this is similar to a new deposit and is to be <em>reported</em> as a NEWT transaction in relation to the full new amount. <p>60. NEW: How should a &ldquo;roller-coaster&rdquo; amortising deposit (with both notional balance increases and decreases during the life-cycle of the trade), be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: In the case of &ldquo;roller-coaster&rdquo; deposits, both increases and decreases of the balance can occur on a daily basis, therefore these instruments should be <em>reported</em> by providing daily information on the balance of the deposit and the interest rate with an overnight maturity (similarly to call accounts). <p>61. NEW: Should structured and inflation-linked bonds be <em>reported</em>? Please note that the corresponding pay-outs of these instruments can be very complex, given that such products are linked to multiple non-interest indices like stock <em>markets</em>, commodities and inflation (for example the pay out of a CMS-based bond can be &ldquo;2 x ISDA 10 Year swap rate &ndash; 3%&rdquo;, or &ldquo;2 x the annual inflation measured as the increase in HCPI&rdquo;). From our point of view, this bond is neither fixed nor floating interest. There <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 14 <p>is no interest component included in the coupon. If such products are <em>reportable</em> please clearly outline how such products should be <em>reported</em>. <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that such products, and more specifically the ones described above, are not <em>reportable</em>. <p>62. NEW: Should Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) with variable notional (i.e. Variable Notional Swaps) be <em>reported</em>? That is, a swap which has a rollercoaster notional structure, which is agreed upon before closing the product. For example: notional first period = 100; notional second period = 90; notional third period = 80. <p>Eurosystem reply: This swap should be <em>reported</em> when it is a swap with one leg depending on the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA) and one fixed leg. The notional to be <em>reported</em> initially is the notional 100. Further changes to the notional are lifecycle events because they are predefined and therefore should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>63. NEW: Should In Arrears Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: This type of instrument should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>64. NEW: It is unclear whether or not fixed rate notes have to be <em>reported</em>. Could you please clarify? <p>Eurosystem reply: Fixed rate instruments which have a maturity of up to 397 days issued by the <em>reporting</em> agent, as well as fixed rate notes which have a maturity of up to 397 days issued by other credit institutions and underwritten by the <em>reporting</em> agent should be <em>reported</em>. <p>65. NEW: What is meant by &ldquo;other short-term debt securities&rdquo;; which products fall under this category? <p>Eurosystem reply: &ldquo;Other short-term debt securities&rdquo; are securities with the same characteristics as, for example, commercial paper or certificates of deposit, but not categorised as such. <p>66. NEW: Should evergreen term products be <em>reported</em>? These instruments have a revolving structure with a constant maturity of e.g. 35 days (similar to open trades). As long as there is no notice, the trade is prolonged on a daily basis. Because of the maturity of 35 days, there is a notice period of 35 days. <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, evergreen term products should be <em>reported</em>. They should be <em>reported</em> each day as long as there is no notice. <p>67. NEW: Should subsidised loans, such as loans provided via other credit institutions to SMEs or private households, be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Loans to non-banks do not have to be <em>reported</em>, so the loan between a credit institution and the final beneficiary (e.g. an SME) should not be <em>reported</em>. However, if this trade involves an interbank transaction or a transaction <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 15 <p>with <em>MMSR</em>-eligible counterparty, this transaction should be <em>reported</em>, regardless of the final beneficiary. <p>68. NEW: Should time deposits (also called term deposits) be <em>reported</em> if they are sold/settled via commercial branches to clients classified as &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; but with settlement in a current account that these clients have with the <em>reporting</em> agent (and not settled via TARGET2)? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, these transactions should be <em>reported</em>. In addition, unsecured borrowing from non-financial corporations (NFCs) classified as &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; should be <em>reported</em>, regardless of the settlement method or channel. <p>69. NEW: Some products have supplementary features in addition to the &quot;Put/Call Date&quot; or &quot;Call/Put Notice Period&quot;. The basis of this product is an &quot;open end structure&quot; comparable to call accounts. In contrast to call accounts, however, the Call/Put Notice Period is e.g. 30 days while in addition, the counterparty has an availability period of e.g. 7 days. Should these types of instruments be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Such products should be <em>reported</em>. Daily <em>reporting</em> needs to take place analogous to call accounts where the &quot;Call/Put Notice Period&quot; is <em>reported</em> (as 30 days) while the availability period (of 7 days) should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>70. NEW: Should <em>money</em> <em>market</em> deposits that are pawned to the <em>reporting</em> agent as collateral for a different transaction (that is outside the <em>MMSR</em> scope, such as Letters of Credit) be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: This type of instrument should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>1.2.3 Related to the FX swaps <em>market</em> segment <p>71. Would it be possible to <em>report</em> FX swaps as two separate legs (the spot leg and the forward leg), by also including a link identifier that would allow to easily recognizing multi-leg transactions? <p>Eurosystem reply: Under Regulation ECB/2014/48, FX Swaps should be <em>reported</em> as one single transaction including both legs. <p>72. Should we <em>report</em> FX swap transactions conducted with the central bank of Denmark as part of their exchange rate management? <p>Eurosystem reply: If a transaction results from ECB tender operations and standing facilities, it need not be <em>reported</em>; otherwise all transactions with central banks should be <em>reported</em>. If a credit institution which is part of the actual <em>reporting</em> population conducts an FX swap with the central bank of Denmark, it would need to <em>report</em> this transaction. <p>73. It is not clear how and when to <em>report</em> forward starting trades. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 16 <p>Eurosystem reply: Forward starting trades must always be <em>reported</em> on the trade date. <p>1.2.4 Related to the overnight index swaps <em>market</em> segment <p>74. Is it correct, that in the OIS <em>market</em> segment only EONIA against a fixed interest rate should be <em>reported</em>? Or is it also possible that another variable interest rate (such as EURIBOR 1 month or USD-LIBOR 1 month) against EONIA is <em>reported</em>? If so, how should it be <em>reported</em>, because the field for the second interest rate (&quot;not Overnight index (EONIA) leg&quot;) is called &quot;fixed interest rate&quot; and also in the description only fixed rates are mentioned? <p>Eurosystem reply: Only EONIA against a fixed interest rate should be <em>reported</em>. <p>75. Should overnight versus tom-next EUR/currency transactions be <em>reported</em> or should they be included as OIS operations? <p>Eurosystem reply: Any purchase\sale of euro vs. a foreign currency on a given value date with an agreement at the same time to resell the purchased currency against the currency sold on the initial value date must be <em>reported</em> as a foreign exchange swap transaction. <p>76. NEW: Should cleared OIS transactions, including in the case of client clearing, be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Cleared transactions, including client clearing, must be included in the <em>reporting</em>, since the clearing broker or member acts as a principal and for that reason the transactions (<em>reporting</em> agent-CCP and <em>reporting</em> agent-client) are on the balance sheet of the <em>reporting</em> agent. <p>1.3 Revisions, re-negotiations and specific transaction conditions <p>77. Could you please define the <em>reporting</em> criteria for events on deals already <em>reported</em>, for example decreases, amortizations, errors, etc. <p>Eurosystem reply: Unless otherwise stated, subsequent or life-cycle events are not to be <em>reported</em>. Transaction rollovers are <em>reported</em> as separate, new transactions identified in the appropriate way (i.e. as NEWT). Floating rate instruments and transactions are <em>reported</em> only when initially concluded with the indication of the discount margin, reference rate and the spread. Amendment of existing transactions should be <em>reported</em> on the business day following the amendment using the same transaction identifier as the original, initially <em>reported</em> transaction. <p>78. Could you please elaborate with respect to the amendments, cancellation and renegotiations of the deals such as renewal, rollovers, and changes in some already <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 17 <p><em>reported</em> detail of the contract (e.g. transactions with maturity less than one year which are then renegotiated with maturity more than a year; early repayments; etc.)? <p>Eurosystem reply: <p>(a) Rollover: needs to be <em>reported</em> as new transactions; <p>(b) Changes understood as amendments/corrections: The variable named &lsquo;<em>Reported</em> Transaction Status&rsquo; distinguishes between new transactions and &lsquo;amendments&rsquo;, &lsquo;corrections&rsquo; or &lsquo;cancellations&rsquo; of a previous transaction: <p>&bull; &lsquo;amendments&rsquo; are changes to previously transmitted records due to erroneous values in the transaction record variables identified by the <em>reporting</em> agent, without any Eurosystem notification; <p>&bull; &lsquo;corrections&rsquo; are errors in the format and/or errors in the values of the transaction record variables, which the Eurosystem has indicated that the <em>reporting</em> agent should correct; <p>&bull; &lsquo;cancellations&rsquo; are transmitted records that need to be deleted. A cancellation, for instance, could be necessary because a transaction was transmitted repeatedly. <p>(c) Renegotiations: such as a re-price or a re-rate of a transaction must be <em>reported</em> as new transactions with the new terms agreed on the day in which the renegotiation takes place. The initially <em>reported</em> transaction must not be cancelled or amended. <p>(d) There is no requirement to <em>report</em> life-cycle events such as margin calls, collateral substitutions, exercising of options or resetting of the interest rate on variable rate instruments. <p>(e) If a <em>reporting</em> agent identifies a need to amend a trade after having received a correction request from the ECB or the national central bank (NCB), the corrected and amended transaction should be <em>reported</em> with status &lsquo;Correction&rsquo; (and not as &lsquo;Amendment&rsquo;). However, it is also expected that internal diligences on matching and confirmation of trades are generally performed before trades are <em>reported</em> to the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em> tool (between 6 p.m. on the trading date and 7 a.m. the day after) and therefore such occurrences should be limited. <p>If several corrections and amendments have to be made before resubmission of a transaction, only the final record of the respective transaction can be transmitted in the <em>reported</em> file because the Data Quality Checks reject files which contain several transactions with the same PTI. Renegotiations are <em>reported</em> separately as new trades. <p>Furthermore, in the following cases (in which several changes occur for one transaction within the same day) the <em>reporting</em> agent should send the transaction with the next transmission of data with the status indicated below. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 18 <p>1. AMND and CANC? The transaction should be resent with status CANC. <p>2. AMND and CORR? The transaction should be resent with status CORR. <p>3. CORR and CANC? The transaction should be resent with status CANC. <p>Furthermore, regarding the threshold of erroneous transactions, the following cases need to be considered. <p>The number of erroneous transactions in a <em>reported</em> file is below the threshold (i.e. the <em>reported</em> file contains less than X% rejected transactions): the <em>reporting</em> agent receives a request for correction of the erroneous transactions in the status message and the rejected transactions should be resent with CORR status. Where the <em>reporting</em> agent amends the transaction before the resubmission, it should <em>report</em> this transaction with status CORR. <p>The number of erroneous transactions in a <em>reported</em> file is above the threshold (i.e. the <em>reported</em> file contains more than X% rejected transactions): the entire file is rejected. The <em>reporting</em> agent should send a corrected file where the transactions have the initial status (e.g. if a transaction had status NEWT in the initially submitted file, then this transaction should also have status NEWT in the resubmitted file, if the status was CORR in the initial file it should be resubmitted as CORR, etc.). Where the <em>reporting</em> agent amends a new transaction before the resubmission, it also needs to <em>report</em> this transaction with status NEWT. <p>79. How should lifecycle events be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Life-cycle events such as margin calls, collateral substitutions, exercising of options or resetting of the interest rate on variable rate instruments should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>80. NEW: Some transactions foresee an option of early repayment that implies the change of the rate &ndash; i.e. a percentage of the rate is transformed in a fee or anyway the rate is somehow reduced in case of early repayment. Is this considered as lifecycle event, and consequently outside of the <em>MMSR</em> scope? <p>Eurosystem reply: Indeed, this is classified as a life-cycle event, and therefore should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>81. How should novations be <em>reported</em>? If a <em>reporting</em> agent is stepping away, is it required to submit a cancellation and for the new <em>reporting</em> agent to submit the new trade as a new transaction? If a <em>reporting</em> agent is the remaining party, would it be required to submit an amendment to an existing transaction? What happens in case the novation implies that a trade is no longer eligible for <em>reporting</em>? Is only a cancellation required? <p>Eurosystem reply: If a <em>reporting</em> agent is the remaining party, it should <em>report</em> a new transaction, and the initial transaction does not need to be cancelled. If it is stepping away, there is no need to <em>report</em> cancellation. Similarly, where the novation implies <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 19 <p>that a trade is no longer eligible, this event does not need to be <em>reported</em> and there is no need to send a cancellation. <p>82. NEW: Should partial cancellations/terminations be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Partial cancellations or terminations must be <em>reported</em> as an amendment or correction, if they are made because of a <em>reporting</em> mistake. If a partial cancellation or termination corresponds to a renegotiation, the transaction should be <em>reported</em> as new &ndash; including new features of the deal and a new Proprietary Transaction Identifier (PTI)/Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI). <p>83. NEW: Should total cancellations/full terminations be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: An early termination of a trade should not be <em>reported</em>; nor should it be <em>reported</em> when the trade matures. However, if a cancellation is made because the trade does not exist (i.e. the transaction was <em>reported</em> by mistake and was never intended to take place), this should be <em>reported</em> as a cancellation. <p>84. NEW: Regarding early terminations before the maturity date, could you please clarify what should be <em>reported</em> in case of a partial or full termination after the settlement date - a renegotiation of the initial contract, a new trade, or a life-cycle event (i.e. no <em>reporting</em>)? <p>Eurosystem reply: There is nothing to be <em>reported</em> in this case. When partial or full termination can be foreseen by the contract and takes place before the maturity date, this is considered as a life-cycle event and does not need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>85. NEW: Could you please clarify what should be <em>reported</em> in case of renegotiations between the trade date and the settlement date? <p>Eurosystem reply: Renegotiation at any time after the initial agreement should be <em>reported</em> as a new transaction. <p>86. NEW: Could you please clarify what should be <em>reported</em> in case of increase events? <p>Eurosystem reply: Increase events should be <em>reported</em> as amendments or corrections if they correspond to a mistake in the <em>reported</em> data. If the increase is due to a renegotiation, the transaction should be <em>reported</em> as NEWT &ndash; including the new amount and a new Proprietary Transaction Identifier (PTI)/Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI). <p>87. Please provide further information regarding the definition of a re-opening. <p>Eurosystem reply: Re-openings are currently outside the scope of the <em>MMSR</em> framework. We might however re-assess this position once we have gained experience with the <em>reporting</em>. <p>88. Convertible bonds: Since convertible bonds are within the scope of the <em>MMSR</em> it seems necessary to provide an example of how to <em>report</em> convertible bonds within our <em>reporting</em> schema. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 20 <p>Eurosystem reply: An example for the <em>reporting</em> of a convertible bond is provided below. <p>Unsecured marked example: Convertible bond <p>Text description: <em>Reporting</em> agent: BNP Paribas, Paris.

NEW: Could you please clarify what should be <em>reported</em> in the case of a rejected file? <p>Eurosystem reply: If a file is rejected, the <em>reporting</em> agent should resubmit all of the transactions in a new file. The resubmitted status of the transactions should be the same as the initial status of the rejected file (if the status of the initial transaction in the rejected file is NEWT, you should <em>report</em> the transaction with NEWT in the new file; if the status of the initial transaction in the rejected file is AMND, you should <em>report</em> the transaction with AMND in the new file, etc.). <p>90. NEW: Can you confirm that when providing a UTI on a trade, we can submit multiple &ldquo;new-trade-events&rdquo; with the same UTI? This will be the case for example when we submit renegotiations for a FX Swap (= new trade with the same UTI as the original trade)? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, this is not correct. Please note that in the event of a renegotiation, a new Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) should be provided (if <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 21 <p>available, since the field is currently not mandatory). However, in the case of amendments or corrections the UTI should not be changed. <p>91. NEW: An existing transaction in the systems of the <em>reporting</em> agent has become eligible &ndash; e.g. due to a change of the counterparty sector classification caused by an initial classification mistake: from S11 (small enterprise) to S122. What should be <em>reported</em> in this case? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent should ignore the previous (suppressed/non-<em>reported</em>) transactions and <em>report</em> the latest version of the deal as a new transaction, including the original trade date and the new counterparty information. <p>92. NEW: An existing transaction in the systems of the <em>reporting</em> agent has become ineligible &ndash; e.g. due to a change of the counterparty sector classification caused by an initial classification mistake: from S12 to S11 (small enterprise). What should be <em>reported</em> in this case? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> a cancellation. <p>93. NEW: A transaction has been <em>reported</em> wrongly and is included in the Status Message file; consequently the Eurosystem expects to receive a corrected version of the trade. What should be done if the transaction has been cancelled? <em>Report</em> CANC? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> a cancellation of the trade. <p>94. NEW: A renegotiation of the nominal amount: could you please clarify what should be <em>reported</em> in case of the following example? <p>&bull; 14 November: Initially agreed nominal amount of EUR 5 million <p>&bull; 25 November: An increase of EUR 3 million on the same transaction. <p>Eurosystem reply: The example provided describes a renegotiation, since &ldquo;renegotiations are all instances in which after the initial agreement, the parties of a financial transaction agree to modify the initially agreed financial terms applicable to the original transaction&rdquo; (page 8 of the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions). Therefore, the new amount of EUR 8 million should be <em>reported</em> on 25 November as a new trade. <p>95. NEW: In a novation almost all trade details remain the same. The initially agreed financial terms applicable to the original transaction are not modified. This includes the fixed rate. The fixed rate for the new swap can therefore be off-<em>market</em>. Is such an off-<em>market</em> rate a problem in the <em>reports</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: The rate should represent the conditions of the financial contract as such. In that respect, the rate should be <em>reported</em> regardless of the fact that it could be seen as off-<em>market</em>. However, as there will be multiple checks on the transaction business level, this could lead to <em>questions</em>/enquiries from the <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 22 <p>Eurosystem to the <em>reporting</em> agent in the event that the <em>reported</em> data is seen as off- <em>market</em>. <p>96. NEW: Normally in a novation the present value (<em>market</em> value) of the swap is settled between the two original counterparties. Is this something that needs to be considered in the <em>MMSR</em> submission? If so, how? <p>Eurosystem reply: The present value of the contact should not be <em>reported</em> under the <em>MMSR</em> framework. <p>1.4 Other <p>97. Are there any releases planned that will change the scope of <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: There are currently no planned future releases which would change the scope of the <em>reporting</em>. Please note, however, that <em>statistical</em> regulations are periodically reviewed to ensure that they reflect monetary policy needs and that <em>reporting</em> obligations which have become redundant are eliminated. <p>98. Should deals with a maturity date of one year or greater than the <em>reporting</em> or trade date be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: All unsecured, secured and foreign exchange swap transactions with a maturity of up to 397 days after the settlement date and all overnight index swap (OIS) transactions at any maturity shall be <em>reported</em> as set down in Regulation ECB/2014/48 and its annexes defining the <em>reporting</em> schemes. <p>99. Would a <em>reporting</em> agent need to <em>report</em> eligible transactions where the counterparty is an NCB/ECB? <p>Eurosystem reply: If a transaction results from ECB tender operations or from standing facilities, it should not be <em>reported</em>; otherwise all transactions with central banks should be <em>reported</em> as long as they fulfil the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em> criteria. <p>100. Should a <em>reporting</em> agent make a <em>report</em> if he knows that a deal could or is going to fail in settlement? <p>Eurosystem reply: A <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> the deal, regardless of the fact it might not be settled. In the case of deals which are cancelled (for example, due to a settlement failure or due to an error because of a duplicated <em>reporting</em>) the respective transaction must be <em>reported</em> as cancelled. <p>101. Should transactions with the Ministry of Finance\Economic Affairs be <em>reported</em> even though the NCB might already have all the details of those operations? <p>Eurosystem reply: They should be <em>reported</em>. The <em>reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> these operations as transactions conducted with general government. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 23 <p>102. Could you please provide clarification whether the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em> includes transactions in all currencies or only transactions in EUR. This would be especially relevant for FX swaps: should they be <em>reported</em> only if the base currency is EUR? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> should include only EUR-denominated transactions. Foreign exchange swap transactions should be <em>reported</em> only if one of the currencies in the pair is the euro, regardless of whether it is the base currency or not. <p>103. Could you please provide further clarifications regarding the operations conducted in &ldquo;New MIC&rdquo; (<em>market</em> for collateralised interbank deposit)? <p>Eurosystem reply: They should be <em>reported</em> as secured/collateralised transactions. <p>104. How should cash settled GMRA Collateral Margin exchanges be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Margin call including cash margins do not need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>105. Could you please provide further clarification on intra-group transactions? <p>Eurosystem reply: Intra-group transactions are excluded. This is stated in the first recital of Regulation ECB/2014/48, &ldquo;The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) requires, for the fulfilment of its tasks, the production of <em>statistics</em> on <em>money</em> <em>market</em> transactions &hellip; but excluding intra-group transactions&rdquo;, and is further emphasised in Article 1(9) and in the Annexes defining the <em>reporting</em> schemes. In addition, Article 1(19) provides a clear definition of intra-group transactions, namely transactions between two different legal entities that are part of the same group, based on the International Financial <em>Reporting</em> Standards (IFRS) or supervisory consolidation, as specified in the Regulation. <p>106. Is it envisaged the <em>reporting</em> to take place via a single <em>reporting</em> channel for the cross border banking groups instead of <em>reporting</em> by a legal entity within the same group. This would avoid the need for a development of several (country level) projects for the transmission of the <em>MMSR</em> data. <p>Eurosystem reply: Provision has been made for such an option. Where the delegation of <em>reporting</em> is agreed, one <em>reporting</em> agent could provide the data for all subsidiaries resident within the euro area, e.g. with different legal entity identifier (LEI) codes within the same (truncated) banking group, but in separate files. <p>107. Do both parties of a transaction need to <em>report</em> the same transaction if both parties are required to <em>report</em> under Regulation ECB/2014/48 (dual <em>reporting</em>)? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, under Regulation ECB/2014/48 both parties have to <em>report</em> where they are part of the actual <em>reporting</em> population. <p>108. Interpretation of maturity: is the &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; in the Regulation and <em>Reporting</em> Instructions interpreted as &quot;original maturity&quot; or as &quot;remaining maturity&quot;? <p>Eurosystem reply: The maturity which is to be <em>reported</em> is the original maturity. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 24 <p>109. Could you please confirm that there will not be a need to <em>report</em> new transactions prior to the <em>reporting</em> start date and that there will not be a requirement to backload live transactions? <p>Eurosystem reply: The Eurosystem can confirm that the <em>reporting</em> agents will not need to <em>report</em> transactions prior to the <em>reporting</em> start date and there is no need to backload live transactions. <p>110. Could you please confirm that a <em>reporting</em> agent will need to produce one <em>reporting</em>, including all transactions of EU and EFTA branches? Subsequently subsidiaries of a <em>reporting</em> agent might be obliged to set up their own <em>reporting</em> to either their NCB or the ECB directly. <p>Eurosystem reply: The Eurosystem confirms that subsidiaries of a <em>reporting</em> agent, i.e. with different legal entity identifiers (LEI), will need to <em>report</em> individually unless delegation of <em>reporting</em> is agreed. In that case, one <em>reporting</em> agent could provide the data for all of the subsidiaries but in separate files, for each legal entity. <p>111. How will the Eurosystem treat transactions that are not <em>reportable</em> (over-<em>reporting</em>)? <p>Eurosystem reply: After the initial testing of <em>reporting</em>, the Eurosystem expects all <em>reporting</em> agents to <em>report</em> all (and only) in-scope transactions. The data quality checks which will be carried out on the transmitted files will reject any transaction which falls outside the scope of the <em>reporting</em> framework. For systematic over- <em>reporting</em>, the Eurosystem may contact <em>reporting</em> agents and would urge them to find a solution. <p>112. Could you please clarify on the transitory regime on the <em>reporting</em> of trades with NFCs: it says that transactions with a &quot;nominal amount below EUR 1 million&quot; are not to be <em>reported</em>? Does this mean that the following transactions are not to be <em>reported</em>? <p>&bull; Day T, counterparty A, transaction 1: EUR 800 000 <p>&bull; Day T, counterparty A, transaction 2: EUR 600 000 <p>&bull; =&gt; on day T the overall transaction volume with counterparty A is above EUR 1 million, but each transaction is below that value =&gt; no <em>reporting</em> of any of these transactions? <p>Eurosystem reply: Correct, no <em>reporting</em> of these transactions is necessary as the criterion is based on individual transaction size and not the cumulative size of transactions on a given day. <p>113. For trades done on a platform facing the CCP, the <em>reporting</em> agent could not <em>report</em> the underlying client as the underlying client/counterparty is not known. <p>Eurosystem reply: For repurchase transactions conducted with a central clearing counterparty (CCP), the CCP needs to be <em>reported</em> as the counterparty. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 25 <p>114. Derivatives Client Clearing: some <em>reporting</em> agents clear OIS transaction to central counterparties (CCPs) bilateral and on behalf of clients. When this is done on behalf of clients to CCPs (as principal), does this require <em>reporting</em> both legs of the transaction (client to us and us to CCP)? <p>Eurosystem reply: All transactions booked on the balance sheet of the <em>reporting</em> agent need to be <em>reported</em>; with regard to the above example &ndash; if both legs are booked on the <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s balance sheet &ndash; both transactions need to be <em>reported</em>. <p>115. The CCPs <em>reports</em> transactions for EMIR/DFA on behalf the counterparties. Is it possible also for <em>MMSR</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, this isn&rsquo;t possible for <em>MMSR</em>. Transactions must be <em>reported</em> by the <em>reporting</em> agent. <p>116. The collateral haircut of the repurchase agreements is of significant commercial sensitivity and, as such, is a good example of why the <em>reporting</em> agents could be significantly concerned about the degree of confidentiality which needs to accompany repo data <em>reporting</em>. Given the multiplicity of agencies with interest in this data, it is vital that there is strong control over confidentiality and that access is restricted to relevant data. Which agencies are permitted access to what data also needs to be made transparent to contributors. <p>Eurosystem reply: The Eurosystem is fully aware of the highly confidential nature of all data that will be transmitted. All data will be handled according to the high confidentiality standards prevailing in the Eurosystem procedures. In this respect, the data will be accessible only to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) users, and not to any third parties. <p>117. We would like to know whether the ECB is going to make the data public at aggregate or country level. <p>Eurosystem reply: The Eurosystem intends to publish data based on <em>MMSR</em> on an aggregated level and with a lower frequency. <p>118. How would <em>reporting</em> agents be expected to proceed with <em>reporting</em> trades with counterparties whose identity cannot be disclosed for privacy/confidentiality reasons (such as those in Asia, Luxembourg and Switzerland, for which the credit institutions encountered a number of problems with respect to the EMIR <em>reporting</em>)? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agents should provide a counterparty identification in the case of credit institutions, supranational authorities or where the transaction is conducted via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). In all other cases, credit institutions should only transmit the counterparty type, e.g. non-financial corporations, and counterparty location, e.g. Germany. This type of information should not disclose any confidential information. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 26 <p>119. Is there a difference in <em>reporting</em> a transaction with a) exchange of the total amount of <em>money</em> on the settlement day or b) only part of the <em>money</em> is exchanged on the settlement day? <p>Eurosystem reply: There is no difference as the settlement details are not within the scope of <em>MMSR</em>. <p>120. Which party should be identified as counterparty? Should the paying agent be <em>reported</em> since settlements will be handled by/through this party? <p>Eurosystem reply: The counterparty is the party with whom the transaction has been concluded &ndash; i.e. the institution which has taken up a legal obligation to lend the cash borrowed by the <em>reporting</em> agent, in the case of borrowing transactions, or has agreed to borrow from the <em>reporting</em> agent in the case of lending/purchase of securities. <p>121. NEW: Concerning Art. 1 No. 19 of the Regulation: Is it correct that <em>reporting</em> agents may choose whether they refer to the consolidation under commercial law (IFRS) or under banking supervision? <p>Eurosystem reply: No. <em>Reporting</em> agents should refer to the relevant legislation to determine whether they are classified as part of the &ldquo;same consolidation&rdquo;. If they are considered as part of the &ldquo;same consolidation&rdquo;, the transactions between the respective entities should not be <em>reported</em> under the <em>MMSR</em> framework. <p>122. NEW: Should transactions conducted before 1 April 2016, be <em>reported</em>? Should amendments performed after 1 April 2016 on trades conducted before the 1 April 2016, be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Only transactions booked as of April 2016 should be <em>reported</em>. No transactions concluded prior to this date should be <em>reported</em>. <p>Amendments to transactions concluded prior to 1 April 2016 should NOT be <em>reported</em>. <p>123. NEW: In case a <em>reporting</em> agent becomes a &ldquo;non-<em>reporting</em> agent&rdquo; due to a merger, is there a need to <em>report</em> outstanding contracts? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, there is no need to <em>report</em> outstanding transactions. <p>124. NEW: Could you please specify whether transactions with sole proprietors (self- employed persons) should be <em>reported</em> under <em>MMSR</em>?? <p>Eurosystem reply: Transactions made with sole proprietors should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>125. NEW: In Section 4.3 (page 10) of the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions, the following explanation is provided regarding the scope of the transactions which need to be <em>reported</em> for the <em>MMSR</em>: &ldquo;[&hellip;] The qualifying principle is the location where the transactions are booked (at the <em>reporting</em> agent level, in all its branches located in <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 27 <p>the Union and in the EFTA) and not where the transactions are originated or executed [&hellip;]&rdquo;. <p>Could you please clarify what exactly is meant by &ldquo;booked&rdquo;? <p>Eurosystem reply: The term &lsquo;booked&rsquo; should be interpreted from dealing perspective, i.e. booked in trading systems (for <em>reporting</em>). The term &lsquo;booked&rsquo; in this section of the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions therefore does not refer to balance sheet recording of the <em>reporting</em> agent. <p>2 <em>Questions</em> regarding the <em>reporting</em> requirements and field definitions <p>2.1 General <p>126. Would it be possible to have a clear indication of the fields that are mandatory, the fields that are mandatory but for which NA value (not applicable) is allowed, and which fields are optional / conditional and which can be left blank. <p>Eurosystem reply: This information is set out in the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions, the XML messages documentation (XML Schemas) and in the <em>MMSR</em> Data Quality Checks. <p>127. Timestamp: What does the timestamp for the field &ldquo;Trade Date&rdquo; correspond to? <p>Eurosystem reply: The timestamp should correspond to the execution time. Otherwise, it can be the booking time (the time at which the trade was recorded). The timestamp is <em>reported</em> as part of the trade date which allows for <em>reporting</em> in date-time format. Alternatively, if the execution time is not available, only the date can be specified in the <em>reporting</em> message. <p>2.2 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions in the BAH/<em>Reporting</em> Header <p>128. Creation Date: should it be <em>reported</em> in a UTC/GMT time zone or, as opposite to this &ndash; with information about a concrete time zone? <p>Eurosystem reply: The Creation Date should be <em>reported</em> as specified in the ISO 20022 documentation of the <em>MMSR</em> XML-schemas &ndash; i.e. it should be aligned with the &ldquo;ISONormalisedDateTime&rdquo; and be <em>reported</em> in UTC/GMT time zone (e.g. &ldquo;2016-07- 05T05:30:00Z&ldquo;). <p>129. Reference period: Is this always day T? Or should it be [T-n days; T] in case there are amendments or transactions that are flagged with &quot;NEWT&quot;? <p>Eurosystem reply: The reference period must be <em>reported</em> as a period and not only a specific point in time. The reference period indicates to which period the <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 28 <p>transactions in the transmitted file refer &ndash; meaning the time from the last submission until the subsequent submission, as start and end of the <em>reporting</em> period. This is irrespective of whether the transactions are new or they are amendments, because this is the period when the deals have been conducted, amended, corrected or cancelled. Under the daily <em>reporting</em> for the <em>MMSR</em>, the time could be the same in both subfields, while the date should have a difference of one business day. For instance: <p>BEGIN: 2015-05-12T18:00:00+01:00 and <p>END: 2015-05-13T18:00:00+01:00. <p>NEW: Moreover, in the event that there are new trades or an amendment from a previous day, the reference period should also cover this previous day. For example, if the file <em>reported</em> in the evening of 14 December 2015 also included amended transactions from 9 December 2015, the reference period should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p>BEGIN: 2015-12-08T18:00:00+01:00 and <p>END: 2015-12-14T18:00:00+01:00. <p>2.3 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for multiple segments <p>130. NEW: Proprietary Transaction Identifier (PTI): Is it correct that the PTI must always be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: This is correct. Regardless of whether or not a UTI (Unique Transaction Identifier) is <em>reported</em>, PTI is a mandatory field. <p>131. Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI): The use of a Unique Transaction Identifier could avoid double counting for derivatives. As for other <em>market</em> segments UTI seems an unavailable option to date and also in the future. <p>A possible introduction of an agreement by which a party (say the lender) provides an Identifier accepted by the counterparty (say the borrower) would entail high implementation costs. Could a different way for matching transactions in order to avoid double counting be evaluated? <p>Eurosystem reply: The Eurosystem is aware of the issues regarding the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI). The UTI field will be initially optional with the aim to make it mandatory at a later stage. The Eurosystem understands that IOSCO is working on the definition of a global UTI. For <em>MMSR</em>, the <em>reporting</em> of the UTI will become mandatory once it is operational and broadly used by the <em>market</em>. <p>The <em>reporting</em> agents have to provide a Proprietary Transaction Identification and are encouraged to provide the Counterparty Proprietary Transaction Identification (as <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 29 <p>explained in the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions) as this information will facilitate the matching of the transactions. <p>132. Unique Transaction Identifier: could you please clarify on how a <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> in case it have not been able to exchange UTI; the only option in such a case would be to <em>report</em> using its own transaction identifier. <p>Eurosystem reply: The UTI is left as an optional field to be <em>reported</em> only when available. The Proprietary Transaction Identification is a mandatory field for <em>MMSR</em> which needs to be <em>reported</em> in all cases, i.e. even if the UTI is available and <em>reported</em>. <p>133. Unique Transaction Identifier: UTI registry - counterparties exchange is not executed on trade date, so trouble will appear when including such field in next day, unless a provisional UTI record is set. <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> of UTI is optional at this stage. It should be <em>reported</em> only if available and technically feasible. <p>134. NEW: Unique Transaction Identifier: The UTI has two main parts, the UTI Prefix and the UTI Value. What should be <em>reported</em> in this field: the UTI Value only or the combination of UTI Prefix &amp; UTI Value? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent should provide the UTI Value. <p>135. Counterparty identification: due to different issues related to the banking secrecy a <em>reporting</em> agent could be obliged to mask the identity of some of its counterparties. <p>Eurosystem reply: Where the counterparty is a non-financial corporation there is no need to provide a counterparty identifier. However, this field is mandatory where the counterparty is a credit institution, a supranational authority and where the transaction is conducted via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). In the latter case, the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) of the CCP must be provided. We do not believe banking secrecy applies to this type of counterparty. <p>136. Counterparty identification: experience with EMIR shows a number of counterparties still does not have a LEI code. In this respect, would it be possible to <em>report</em> with internal identifier &ndash; awaiting the attribution of a correct LEI code? <p>Eurosystem reply: A <em>reporting</em> agent needs to <em>report</em> the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) where the counterparty is a credit institution, a supranational authority and where the transaction is conducted via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). In the latter case, the LEI of the CCP must be provided. The LEI should not be <em>reported</em> for transactions with non-financial corporations (NFCs). In that respect, it is not allowed to <em>report</em> an alternative to the LEI. Due to the application of data quality checks such transactions will be rejected. The <em>reporting</em> agent should ensure that it is in possession of the correct counterparty LEI when <em>reporting</em> a transaction. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 30 <p>137. Counterparty identification: a <em>reporting</em> agent could conduct transactions facing third- country entities (counterparties that are not located in EFTA) where it could have problems trying to categorize them. <p>Eurosystem reply: Regardless of the location of the counterparty, the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) must be provided in the case of a trade with another credit institution, supranational authorities and where the transaction is conducted via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). In the latter case, the LEI of the CCP must be provided. The counterparty sector and locations should be provided for other counterparties. <p>138. Counterparty identification: If the <em>reporting</em> agent knows the counterparty identifier for counterparties that are not credit institutions, would it be better to provide it instead of counterparty location and counterparty sector. <p>Eurosystem reply: The counterparty identifier should be <em>reported</em> only in the case of credit institutions, supranational authorities and where the transaction is conducted via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). In all other cases, only counterparty sector and location need to be <em>reported</em> &#x2012; the counterparty identifier field should be omitted. This facilitates processing on the Eurosystem side and protects client confidentiality on the <em>reporting</em> agents&rsquo; side. <p>139. NEW: Counterparty identification: For the purposes of internal mapping and correct identification of counterparties in the <em>reporting</em> agents&rsquo; systems, could you please specify which ESA 2010 codes are applicable to credit institutions and supranational authorities? <p>Eurosystem reply: The applicable sector code for credit institutions is S122 (Deposit-taking corporations except the central bank). <p>There is no single unique code in the ESA 2010 framework which could be assigned to supranational authorities. <p>140. NEW: Counterparty identification: If we are not able to include an LEI because a financial counterparty to a transaction has not applied for one, how should we complete the details of the transaction? <p>Eurosystem reply: If the LEI is not available then the counterparty sector and location are mandatory. However, this should be only applicable in strictly exceptional cases and in all these cases the <em>reporting</em> agents will be requested to clarify this information. <p>141. Counterparty sector: will there be any mapping between <em>reporting</em> codes and the ones defined by each NCB? <p>Eurosystem reply: A provision for a mapping of the <em>reporting</em> codes is not envisaged. The Eurosystem will be using ISO 20022 standards and the European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010 (Regulation (EU) No 549/2013) which fully conform to the international <em>statistical</em> standards (2008 SNA). This approach is meant to facilitate international comparisons and foster a richer analysis of the results, also in <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 31 <p>the light of other <em>statistics</em> like those on credit institutions&rsquo; balance sheets and interest rates. The conversion between <em>reporting</em> codes should be applied by the <em>reporting</em> agent. <p>142. NEW: Counterparty location: which location should be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: This information should be populated as country of incorporation. <p>143. Trade Date/Settlement Date/Maturity Date: should the <em>reporting</em> agent specify the time zone in case the Trade Date is provided as Date and not as DateTime; if yes, how this should be performed? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reported</em> Date should correspond to the date in the CET time zone. The same applies to all variables which are <em>reported</em> using the Date format. Example: 2014-11-26 stands for 26 November 2014 CET. <p>144. Maturity date: could you please specify how a <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> the maturity date for an open repo &ndash; should it be the 1st call date; if yes, what if the 1st call date is 48 hours? <p>Eurosystem reply: For open repos, the maturity date for the <em>reporting</em> agents should be the first date at which the operation can be terminated/closed (call date). If the first call date is two days after the value date then the <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> the maturity date accordingly. <p>145. Maturity date: should a <em>reporting</em> agent indicate the residual period of a deal? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, the residual period should not be <em>reported</em>, only the original maturity. <p>146. NEW: Maturity date: Should we consider TARGET2 closing days when <em>reporting</em> the maturity date for open-ended trades? In case the appointed maturity date falls on a weekend should the maturity date be <em>reported</em> &quot;rolled&quot; (the next Target2 business date) or &quot;unrolled&quot;? <p>For instance: a trade rolls on 30 April (1 May being a TARGET2 closing day). What would be the maturity date for this trade? 1 May or 2 May? <p>Another example: <p>(a) unrolled on 2016/08/06 (Saturday) <p>(b) rolled on 2016/08/08 (Monday) <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that the maturity date should be <em>reported</em> as the rolled date. Therefore the maturity date should be <em>reported</em> as 2 May. In the other example, the maturity date should be <em>reported</em> as 8 August. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 32 <p>147. Transaction nominal amount: should the notional or principal nominal amount be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: It varies depending on the segment and instrument. The <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions provide clear definitions. <p>148. Transaction nominal amount: how shall the transactional nominal amount be <em>reported</em> in cases where there is a redemption scheme? <p>Eurosystem reply: Regardless of whether the transaction is with a redemption scheme, <em>reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> the initial transaction nominal amount. Please note that life-cycle events should not be <em>reported</em>. <p>149. Transaction nominal amount: Should the nominal amount be the cash paid/received at the beginning of a transaction? Should a premium or discount (agio or disagio) be included? <p>Eurosystem reply: In the case of debt securities, it is the nominal amount of the security issued/purchased. The premium/discount which results from the product of such nominal amount times the transaction deal price needs to be <em>reported</em> separately. <p>150. NEW: Transaction nominal amount: Does the Transaction Nominal Amount field in case of equity loans refer to cash (number of equities times the price)? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, this is correct. <p>151. Deal rate: it can be a rate (as a percentage or basis points), but it can also be a fee (as an amount); in some cases of securities lending a <em>reporting</em> agent could even negotiate the fee at the portfolio level (payable at variable terms). Could you please specify what should be stated within the <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: According to the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions, a fee amount is converted into a percentage per annum on the transactional nominal amount. <p>152. Deal rate: how shall open repos and operations with several fixing periods be <em>reported</em>? Shall each fixing be <em>reported</em> separately? <p>Eurosystem reply: Each open basis repo rollover should be <em>reported</em> as a separate transaction with its own deal rate. Floating rate instruments need to be <em>reported</em> when initially concluded with the indication of the reference rate and the spread. There is no need to <em>report</em> each fixing. <p>153. Deal Rate: is the dot (&lsquo;.&rsquo;) included in the total length? <p>Eurosystem reply: The dot [.] is not included in the total length. <p>154. Deal Rate: How should the sign in the XML files be <em>reported</em>? <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 33 <p>Eurosystem reply: When <em>reporting</em> the field &lsquo;Deal Rate&rsquo; the appropriate sign should be provided within the designated tag. <p>For instance, negative rates should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p>&ndash;0.339 =&gt; <p>&lt;DealRate&gt; <p> &lt;Sgn&gt;false&lt;/Sgn&gt; <p> &lt;Rate&gt;0.339&lt;/Rate&gt; <p> &lt;/DealRate&gt; <p>&hellip; while positive rates should be <em>reported</em> as follows: <p>0.339 =&gt; <p>&lt;DealRate&gt; <p> &lt;Sgn&gt;true&lt;/Sgn&gt; <p> &lt;Rate&gt;0.339&lt;/Rate&gt; <p> &lt;/DealRate&gt; <p>Do not put the sign in the rate tag, e.g. do NOT <em>report</em> the Deal Rate as follows: <p>&lt;DealRate&gt; <p> &lt;Sgn&gt;false&lt;/Sgn&gt; <p> &lt;Rate&gt;&ndash;0.339&lt;/Rate&gt; <p> &lt;/DealRate&gt; <p><p> or <p><p>&lt;DealRate&gt; <p> &lt;Sgn&gt;true&lt;/Sgn&gt; <p> &lt;Rate&gt;+0.339&lt;/Rate&gt; <p>&lt;/DealRate&gt; <p><p>Zero-Rate should be <em>reported</em> as follows &ndash; without sign tag: <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 34 <p>0.00% =&gt; <p>&lt;DealRate&gt; <p> &lt;Rate&gt;0.000&lt;/Rate&gt; <p>&lt;/DealRate&gt; <p>155. NEW: Deal Rate: which type of interest needs to be <em>reported</em> for those contracts which are between 365 and 397 days? For this particular case should it be simple interest rate or compounded? <p>Eurosystem reply: In case of deposits, repos, etc. it should be the contractually agreed interest rate (simple). In case of debt instruments it should be the yield to maturity, or the discount margin for floating rate notes (FRNs). <p>156. NEW: Deal Rate: As there are different methods for calculating the adjusted interest rate using different approaches, can <em>reporting</em> agents use a conversion of the interest rate other than ACT/360 (e.g. ICMA conversion of act/act)? <p>Eurosystem reply: For the time being, if need be, the <em>reporting</em> agents are permitted to choose their preferred formula for converting interest rates using a convention other than ACT/360. <p>157. Reference rate index: the underlying ISIN codes for some of the indices are not available. Is it possible the Eurosystem to provide a list with values which would allow the banks to implement a mapping to it? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, the Eurosystem can provide a list of the most commonly used reference rate indices.

NEW: Reference Rate Index: What should be <em>reported</em> in case that there is more than one reference rate index applicable for a transaction? <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 35 <p>Eurosystem reply: Under ISO 20022 only one reference rate index can be <em>reported</em>. Therefore the reference rate index with the biggest influence should be <em>reported</em>. <p>159. NEW: Basis Point Spread/FX Forward Point: Those fields should be completed as a positive or negative number according to the rules set up by the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions and the documentation of the <em>MMSR</em> XML-schemas (ISONumber and ISODecimalNumber); consequently these variables should include a sign. However, there is no a separate tag for a sign (like for the Deal Rate). Could you please specify how this should be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: The sign should be <em>reported</em> by including a prefix (with the +/&ndash; sign) to the numerical digits. <p>160. Basis Point Spread/FX Forward Point: according to the rules set up by the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions and the documentation of the XML-schemas this number (ISONumber and ISODecimalNumber) should be signed; however, is the sign (&lsquo;+&rsquo; or &lsquo;-&lsquo;) included in the total length? Moreover, is the dot (&lsquo;.&rsquo;) included in the total length? <p>Eurosystem reply: The sign and the dot [.] are not included in the total length. <p>2.4 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the secured segment <p>161. Counterparty sector and Collateral issuer sector: as there might not be possible to have the ESA 2010 classification implemented into the systems of the <em>reporting</em> agents, is it possible for the ECB to provide a mapping &ndash; between ESA classification and other standards, such as NACE &ndash; which to be used for facilitating the <em>reporting</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: Unfortunately, it is not possible to establish a one-to-one mapping between the NACE classification of economic activities and the ESA institutional sector classification. In particular, the decision on the sector classification for <em>statistical</em> purposes depends on factors (such as legal control, ownership, losses covering, etc.) which are not necessarily related to the kind of activity performed by the unit. <p>162. Collateral ISIN and collateral type: Tri-party repo &ndash; it is not clear how ISIN and collateral type fields will work for tri-party repo trades where collateral could be made up of several ISINs and/or products. <p>Eurosystem reply: Individual ISINs should be <em>reported</em> in the case of a repurchase transaction with one or more (in the case of multi-collateral repos) pieces of collateral (e.g. if a transaction is backed by five different pieces of collateral, five ISINs are to be provided). <p>As regards tri-party repos, an ISIN must be <em>reported</em> in the case of pooling repos in which the basket is identified via an ISIN (Eurex/GC Pooling and LCH/GC+ for <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 36 <p>example). In these cases, neither collateral type nor details of the collateral finally allocated by the CCP needs to be <em>reported</em>. <p>When the collateral cannot be identified via one or more ISINs, the collateral type should be <em>reported</em>. This may be the case for bilateral (where the collateral is not represented by a security), CCP-cleared or tri-party repos. In these cases the Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI) code must be provided to identify the collateral type. <p>Where a basket has no generic ISIN and comprises several asset classes on an ad hoc basis (e.g. 60% government bonds, 30% equities, 10% corporate bonds), the CFI code of the largest asset category is retained &ndash; in this case government bonds. <p>163. Collateral ISIN: in case the collateral is a new issue, it might be the case that the ISIN is only known 1 or 2 days after the emission. As the <em>reporting</em> of an ISIN is only necessary for &quot;ISIN of collateral&quot; in the secured <em>market</em> segment (and this is an optional field), would it be sufficient to <em>report</em> &quot;collateral type&quot; and &quot;collateral issuer sector&quot; in these cases? And additionally, would you expect to receive an amendment with the ISIN when it&#39;s known after 1 or 2 days? <p>Eurosystem reply: If the ISIN is not known to the <em>reporting</em> agent when the <em>reporting</em> should take place, then &ldquo;collateral type&rdquo; and &ldquo;collateral issuer sector&rdquo; should be <em>reported</em>. Regarding the resubmission of the amended transaction containing the ISIN, we would expect the transaction to be resubmitted as an amendment containing the ISIN of the collateral. <p>164. Collateral type: For repos, what are the &quot;collateral types&quot;? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> the Classification of Financial Instruments code (CFI &ndash; ISO 10962:2015) under the field collateral type. <p>165. NEW: Collateral type: ISO 10962 is a quite complex code &ndash; what level of detail is expected to be provided for that field? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> as much detailed code as possible, i.e. aim to complete all six levels of the CFI code to the extent possible. For instance: <p>Equities - 1 level <p>Common/ordinary shares - 2 level <p>Non-voting - 3 level <p>Restrictions - 4 level <p>Partly paid - 5 level <p>Bearer - 6 level <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 37 <p>=&gt; should be <em>reported</em> as ESNTPB <p>However, the first two levels of the CFI code must be provided (minimum requirement). For instance: <p>Equities - 1 level <p>Common/ordinary shares - 2 level <p>=&gt; should be <em>reported</em> as ESXXXX <p>Please note that in the case of a basket which contains various asset classes and where it is not possible to identify the basket via a generic single ISIN, then the applicable Collateral Type, Collateral Issuer Sector, Amount and Pool information should be provided. The Collateral type should be populated with the CFI code of the asset representing the largest piece of collateral among those in the basket. <p>166. Collateral haircut: the haircut formula should be more clearly defined (100 - a ratio)? <p>Eurosystem reply: For <em>reporting</em> purposes, the collateral haircut should be calculated as 100 minus the ratio between the cash lent/borrowed and the <em>market</em> value including accrued interest of the collateral pledged. <p>NEW: For this purpose &quot;cash&quot; means &quot;the amount exchanged between the two parties&quot; and &quot;<em>market</em> value&quot; means &quot;the dirty price&quot;. <p>167. Collateral haircut: could you please clarify which value should be used for &quot;Cash lent/borrowed&quot;? Is it the amount paid at the beginning of the transaction or is it the amount repayable? <p>Eurosystem reply: This is the cash paid at the beginning &ndash; when the transaction is conducted. <p>168. NEW: Collateral haircut: According to the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions in case of multi- collateral repos the collateral haircut will be calculated for each of the individual collateral pledged. However, according to the ISO document, the collateral haircut field is not repetitive. Should an average haircut be <em>reported</em> in these cases? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, a weighted average haircut for the whole set of collateral pieces has to be <em>reported</em>. The <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions do not explicitly specify that in the case of multi-collateral repos the haircut should be <em>reported</em> for each piece of collateral; they merely clarify that the haircut should take into account each of the individual pieces of collateral pledged. <p>169. NEW: Collateral pool: What should be <em>reported</em> in case there are different securities lending transactions (security against cash) with an individual PTI each but with &quot;one big cash-collateral pool&quot;? Of course, the securities are <em>reported</em> as collateral for the <em>MMSR</em> <em>reporting</em>. Should the cash be split to cover all individual transactions? <p>For instance: <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 38 <p>There are 5 transactions with 5 different securities (collateral nominal amount EUR 100T each) with the same counterparty. All transactions have their own PTI. In addition there is EUR 500T Cash for all the securities. <p>Should a <em>reporting</em> of 5 transactions with a transaction nominal amount of EUR 100T and a collateral nominal amount EUR 100T each be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: If there is one &ldquo;piece&rdquo; of cash and five ISINs (International Securities Identification Numbers), this is comparable to a multi-collateralised repo transaction which should therefore be <em>reported</em> as one PTI. However, if the <em>reporting</em> agent believes it is better to <em>report</em> five PTIs, each with a different piece of collateral and the cash split into 5 pieces each corresponding to a piece of collateral, this is also possible. <p>170. NEW: Tri-party Agent Identification: What should be <em>reported</em> if the tri-party agent has no LEI? More specifically &ndash; when a tri-party agent is a subsidiary/branch and has no LEI, but its parent company LEI is available. <p>Eurosystem reply: In those cases, the <em>reporting</em> agents should <em>report</em> the LEI of the parent company. <p>2.5 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the unsecured segment <p>171. Instrument type: the types of instruments on which <em>reporting</em> agents <em>report</em> are very wide and include some transaction types (for example call <em>money</em> and deposits) that require more precise definitions. <p>Eurosystem reply: The instrument types for the unsecured <em>market</em> segment are explained in the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions. Definitions of call accounts and deposits are included there, and you can find further clarification on call accounts in Section 1.2.2 of the Q&amp;A document. <p>172. Instrument type: What is the definition of instrument type? And is this related to a recognised industry categorisation? <p>Eurosystem reply: The instrument types are contained in the list of instruments in Section 5.3.1 of the <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions (Instrument type reference table). <p>173. NEW: Instrument type: In the case of a certificate of deposit with a variable interest rate or a zero-coupon bond, does a different instrument type have to be chosen (e.g. floating-rate note)? <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that the zero-coupon bond could also be seen as a fixed-rate instrument; as such, given that the coupon is known in advance and there are no intermediate coupons, this instrument should be <em>reported</em> as a normal certificate of deposit. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 39 <p>Regarding the variable rate certificate of deposit, we assume that indeed it should be seen as a floating rate note because the coupon would be defined by a reference rate + spread (this field is not applicable for fixed rate instruments). <p>174. NEW: Transaction Nominal Amount: In case of issuance of short-term security, would it be necessary to <em>report</em> the size of the issuance or the size of the subscription? How should it be <em>reported</em> in the case of a &ldquo;late&rdquo; subscription of an undersubscribed issuance? <p>Eurosystem reply: What matters is the effective amount of funds raised i.e. subscription. If it is done &ldquo;late&rdquo; it is a new transaction; no secondary <em>market</em> deals are <em>reported</em> &ndash; only primary <em>market</em> transactions are to be <em>reported</em>. <p>175. NEW: Deal Rate: How should this be <em>reported</em> in the case of debt instruments? <p>Eurosystem reply: For short-term securities, the effective interest rate should be the applicable yield to maturity. It should be <em>reported</em> as yield to maturity based on actual cash flows, as opposed to the nominal coupon rate. <p>176. Transaction Deal Price: It is to be <em>reported</em> as 100 for unsecured deposits; Does the same hold for unsecured loans? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, the transaction deal price should be <em>reported</em> as 100 in both cases &ndash; for unsecured deposits and for unsecured loans. <p>177. NEW: First Call/Put date: In the unsecured regarding the variable &lsquo;First Call/Put date&rsquo;, the <em>Reporting</em> Instructions specify that the first date on which the call option or the put option can be exercised should be <em>reported</em>. Can this be already on the same day as the settlement day? <p>Eurosystem reply: While it should rarely be the case that the first call date is already on the same day as the settlement date, this can occur and should be <em>reported</em> accordingly. <p>2.6 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the FX Swaps segment <p>178. NEW: UTI: as FX Swaps have two legs, consequently there are two UTIs. Could you please specify which UTI should be <em>reported</em> &ndash; the near or the far leg UTI? <p>Eurosystem reply: Please note that when <em>reporting</em> foreign exchange (FX) swaps, the <em>reporting</em> agent should provide the transaction identifier (UTI/CPTI) for the near/spot leg of the trade. <p>179. Value date: the spot value date is not always available as some FX swaps are forward /forward. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 40 <p>Eurosystem reply: The value date in the case of forward/forward foreign exchange swaps would be the near-end (the shorter leg) of the transaction. <p>180. Foreign exchange spot rate: is this EUR vs Foreign or Foreign vs EUR? <p>Eurosystem reply: The exchange rates should be <em>reported</em> as the number of foreign currency units per 1 euro. <p>181. Foreign Exchange Forward Points: How it should be <em>reported</em> in case of &quot;tom-next&quot;? <p>Example: <p>Trade Date: 26.08. - Exchange rate: 1,141 <p>Settlement Date: 27.08. - Exchange rate: 1,149 <p>Maturity Date: 28.08. - Exchange rate: 1,151 <p>Which exchange rate should be used for spot rate and forward rate to calculate the Foreign Exchange Forward Points? <p>Eurosystem reply: Foreign exchange forward points are always calculated based on the difference between the foreign exchange forward rate and the foreign exchange spot rate regardless of the swap tenor. <p>182. NEW: Should initial and variation margin be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, this information should not be provided. <p>2.7 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the OIS segment <p>183. NEW: Transaction Nominal Amount: If an amortising overnight index swap is novated, should the original nominal amount be <em>reported</em> or should the current nominal amount that is applicable at the moment of novation be <em>reported</em>? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent should <em>report</em> the current nominal amount. <p>3 <em>Questions</em> regarding the IT implementation and the transmission of data <p>184. NEW: Which days are TARGET2 closing days? <p>Eurosystem reply: TARGET2 closing days are 1 January, Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May, 25 December and 26 December. <p>185. In case there are several separate legal entities within the EFTA, this could lead to the requirement to <em>report</em> to multiple NCBs and potentially also to the ECB. The complexity of segregating the <em>reporting</em> streams is easily recognisable; in this <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 41 <p>respect, could you please confirm that the <em>reporting</em> requirements (format, fields, etc.) will be identical notwithstanding the NCB to which a <em>reporting</em> agent will need to <em>report</em> to? <p>Eurosystem reply: A <em>reporting</em> agent may need to <em>report</em> to several national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB for different legal entities. But the format and fields will be the same across the Eurosystem. There is only one set of <em>Reporting</em> Instructions, including the same set of basic data validation checks for the entire Eurosystem. The only difference would be the transmission channel where the <em>reporting</em> agent needs to provide data to the respective NCB or directly to the ECB. <p>186. The <em>MMSR</em> <em>Reporting</em> Instructions specify that the data for each segment shall be transmitted in separate files. Could single file data transmission also be accommodated? <p>Eurosystem reply: No, the data for each segment must be <em>reported</em> in a separate file. The different files have different variables to be <em>reported</em> and will be subject to different validation checks. <p>187. Would it be possible the data to be delivered in real-time (trade by trade), instead of one daily <em>report</em>. It would make it easier to meet the <em>reporting</em> deadlines. <p>Eurosystem reply: To facilitate the data flows and communication with <em>reporting</em> agents, the <em>reporting</em> must be done by grouping the <em>reports</em> as set out in Regulation ECB/2014/48. This excludes real-time data transmission. <p>However, there is also an option for providing the NCBs with more than one file per day per segment per <em>reporting</em> agent, but this is subject to agreement with the respective NCB. <p>188. File name convention: could you please provide a description of the file naming which is to be used when <em>reporting</em> <em>MMSR</em> data? <p>Eurosystem reply: The name of the <em>MMSR</em> data messages should be constructed in the following way: <p>&lt;MESSAGE DEFINITION IDENTIFIER&gt;.&lt;LEI&gt;.&lt;DATE&gt;.&lt;INCREMENTAL TRANSMISSION NUMBER&gt; <p>Please note that file name should not contain any other elements or extensions, such as .xml or .xsd. <p>189. File name convention: could you please provide as an example the 15-digit <em>market</em> segment identifier which is to be used for the Message Definition Identifier in the File Naming Convention? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>market</em> segment identification is given by using the ISO standards. The identification for the four <em>market</em> segments is the following: <p>&bull; secured segment is identified with &ldquo;auth.012.001.01&rdquo;; <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 42 <p>&bull; unsecured segment is identified with &ldquo;auth.013.001.01&rdquo;; <p>&bull; FX swaps segment is identified with &ldquo;auth.014.001.01&rdquo;; <p>&bull; OIS segment is identified with &ldquo;auth.015.001.01&rdquo;. <p>190. Could you please provide clarification on the feedback loop and its timeliness? <p>Eurosystem reply: The Eurosystem intends to provide a feedback loop with three main elements: (i) upon reception of the data file, an acknowledgement message will be made available and immediate feedback sent in the case of a corrupted file, (ii) quick feedback (in principle within a few hours) when records are invalid in an overall non-corrupted file, and (iii) business-oriented feedback (on salient) developments. <p>191. What mechanisms will be available for <em>reporting</em> agents to be able to evidence controls - completeness, accuracy and SLA compliance? E.g. activity <em>reports</em>, etc. <p>Eurosystem reply: The first level will be a set of data quality checks (i.e. validation rules) covering the technical compliance of the transmitted data. Moreover, the <em>reporting</em> agent will be able to access <em>reporting</em> quality feedback. <p>192. NEW: If there is a corrupted file which needs to be resent, when should this resubmission take place? <p>Eurosystem reply: If possible, the corrected file should be sent on the same day. However, if this is not feasible or not technically possible, the corrected file may also be sent the next day. <p>193. NEW: In the event a file transmission fails, what is the deadline for resubmission/consequences for missing a <em>reporting</em>? If the transaction information is submitted one day late, should the transactions be included into the current days&rsquo; <em>reporting</em> file or should two separate files be submitted (i.e. one for the <em>reporting</em> due that day and one for the previous day that was missed)? <p>Eurosystem reply: If a file is not submitted, the <em>MMSR</em> Transactional Module will send a reminder e-mail. The data must be submitted together with the next mandatory <em>reporting</em> on the next business day. The transactions should be submitted with the status &lsquo;NEWT&rsquo; in two separate files. However, it is also possible that the information could be sent out in one file which includes both the current and the previous transmission. <p>194. NEW: In relation to transactions where the details are incorrect or incomplete: What is the preferred option of the ECB? <p>&bull; Submit known incorrect / incomplete transactions with the knowledge that they will fail validation and will then require resubmission; <p>OR <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 43 <p>&bull; Hold back transactions which have not met the internal validations carried out prior to submission, with a view to amending the required information before submission. <p>Eurosystem reply: The data should be submitted even if the <em>reporting</em> agent knows that the transactions are incorrect or incomplete. <p>The quality of content in each file will be evaluated by the <em>MMSR</em> Transactional Module and information on all errors will be communicated to the <em>reporting</em> agent through automatic messaging. <p>195. NEW: Will the ECB in some cases also query specific details regarding a <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s submitted <em>MMSR</em> data via email? If not, will this occur through the ECB platform instead? <p>Eurosystem reply: For <em>reporting</em> agents submitting directly to the ECB, the following email notifications will be sent by the <em>MMSR</em> Transactional Module: <p>&bull; a reminder if the <em>reporting</em> agent has not submitted one or more of the requested files; <p>&bull; a reminder if there are transactions to be corrected. Corrected transactions should be submitted within a period of 10 TARGET2 business days. If they are not, a reminder will be sent on the ninth day. <p><em>Reporting</em> agents submitting directly to the ECB will have access to all their submission information through WebUI (U2A channel). <p>196. NEW: How much time (approximately) does it take for ECB to do the basic first level validation for the files (ReceiveDeliveryService response) and how long after we receive the submission response can we send the feedback service request (GetFeedbackService) to get the trade level feedback after ReceiveDeliveryService is successful? <p>Eurosystem reply: The information will be available to you approximately ten minutes after the submission. <p>197. NEW: If no values are available / applicable for a particular tag, should it be sent as a blank tag or should the tag not be present in the XML? <p>Eurosystem reply: If it is a mandatory tag, it should be completed. If a mandatory tag is not present in the XML or is not populated, the transaction will be rejected. <p>If it is an optional tag, it should not be present in the XML structure. <p>Please note that there should be no blank or empty tags in any case, as this will lead to a rejection of the transaction. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 44 <p>198. NEW: If the first service request (ReceiveDeliveryService) fails due to validation issues, can the resubmission of the file be done on the same day post the 7 a.m. delivery deadline? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, this is possible. <p>There is no a maximum number of times the service can be called; it can be called as many times as necessary, even outside the submission period. Please note that <em>MMSR</em> system services are available on a 24/7 basis, apart from during maintenance periods. <p>199. NEW: What is the validity of the PKI certificate? Do we have separate certificates for production and pre-production environments? <p>Eurosystem reply: The PKI certificate is valid for 2 years. You should use a production certificate for the preproduction environment. <p>200. NEW: Section 8.4 the IT Appendix states, &ldquo;In case of a Soap Fault, the Web Service response will only contain a SOAP exception (no DeliveryId, no ReportingStatusMessageFile, no StatusMessageFileName will be delivered as expected in the receive DeliveryResponse). The Sender has to contact the <em>MMSR</em> helpdesk or make a new submission.&rdquo; <p>Can this be done after the 7 a.m. next day <em>reporting</em> deadline? Should it be the same name or should it have a new iteration number? <p>Eurosystem reply: Yes, this can be done after 7 a.m. The file can be sent with the same name. <p>201. NEW: During operation timed out scenarios, it is possible that a <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s systems may not receive a response from the ECB although it might have been processed at the ECB (thus receiving a DeliveryID). During resubmission of the file, it would be rejected saying it is a duplicate submission. <p>Will the duplicate submission error be sent back to the <em>reporting</em> agent also share the previous DeliveryID (against which the duplicate check failed) so that the <em>reporting</em> agent&rsquo;s systems can map this to the earlier timed out submission and subsequent getfeedbackservice? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent will be able to recover this information (DeliveryID) manually through the WebUI of the <em>MMSR</em> Transactional Module (U2A channel). It will also be able to download manually the status message through the WebUI. <p>If it is not a scheduled and automated resubmission, we invite you to check the WebUI prior to resubmitting. <p>If the <em>reporting</em> agent resubmits the file, all the transactions will be rejected because they are all already present in the database. The <em>reporting</em> agent will receive a status message, but the previous DeliveryID is not included. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 45 <p>202. NEW: During maintenance periods when the ECB submission platform services are unavailable, how should a resubmission be carried out? For example, if services are unavailable from 1 June &ndash; 3 June, 2016, do we submit all the trades on 4 June with file date as 4 June, or do we submit separate files on the same day? <p>Eurosystem reply: The <em>reporting</em> agent will be able to submit the data in separate files on 4 June for <em>reporting</em> the data for 1 &ndash; 3 June and 4 June. <p>203. NEW: We assume that daily <em>reporting</em> submissions occur Monday to Friday therefore transactions carried out will be <em>reported</em> by 7 a.m. at the latest on Monday morning. Could you please confirm if this understanding is correct? <p>Eurosystem reply: <em>MMSR</em> system services are available on a 24/7 basis with the exception of maintenance periods. Transactions which occur on a Friday must be <em>reported</em> (in case of direct <em>reporting</em> to the ECB) by 7 a.m. on the following Monday morning. <p>Please note that all trades which have been conducted on TARGET2 closing days should also be <em>reported</em>. Therefore transactions conducted for instance on 1 May need to be <em>reported</em> in a separate file. In such a case this file could be <em>reported</em> on the first TARGET2 business day following the TARGET2 closing day - we would have 2 different files being <em>reported</em> on the TARGET2 business day (in our example: by 7:00 a.m. on 2 May). Alternatively, the transactions for 1 May could be included in the file <em>reported</em> on 2 May, together with the transactions of 30 April. In this case the Reference Period in the Business Application Header would need to be adjusted in order to capture both days &ndash; 30 April and 1 May. <p>204. NEW: Due to a production issue, a <em>report</em> is not sent for multiple days; however, all subsequent <em>reports</em> are sent successfully. What do we do about the failed <em>report</em>? Do we <em>report</em> it as soon as it is fixed and just ensure its original <em>report</em> period is referenced? Or can subsequent <em>reports</em> only be sent if the current <em>report</em> has been sent (no missing daily <em>reports</em>)? <p>Eurosystem reply: In general, four files must be submitted by each <em>reporting</em> agent each TARGET2 business day (one for each of the four <em>money</em> <em>market</em> segments), unless agreed otherwise with the respective national central bank (NCB). These files are to be submitted on a given TARGET2 business day independent of whether files have been submitted on the previous TARGET2 business day. If a transmission from a <em>reporting</em> agent to the ECB or respective NCB fails on a certain TARGET2 business day, this <em>report</em> should be sent on the next TARGET2 business day, or alternatively, the respective transactions should be included in the <em>report</em> submitted on the next TARGET2 business day. <p>205. NEW: As missing daily <em>reports</em> are possible, what if a 5 April <em>report</em> gets fixed and submitted on 10 April with a transaction in NEWT status, but an amendment to that transaction was already submitted in an earlier <em>report</em> on 8 April as AMND? What do we do? The assumption is we can&rsquo;t do anything but continue to submit the 5 April <em>report</em> once fixed, and NEWT status will have to come after the AMND version. <p></div><div><p><p><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> - <em>Questions</em> and <em>answers</em> 46 <p>Eurosystem reply: Amendments to transactions can only be <em>reported</em> after the original transaction has been <em>reported</em> &ndash; otherwise the respective transaction will fail the data quality checks and be rejected. Therefore, the <em>reporting</em> agent should first submit the respective transactions for 5 April by submitting the corrected <em>report</em> on 6 April (or within 10 days at the latest). <p>206. NEW: When a file is rejected, what would be assigned to the transactions which are included to the file? Are all transactions in a file marked as rejected or are the different transactions assigned with the different applicable status? Should the <em>reporting</em> agent resend all the transaction or just the rejected ones, and with the original or the correction status. <p>Eurosystem reply: This depends on whether there is a breach of the threshold for erroneous transactions. The following two cases should be considered: <p>(a) The number of erroneous transactions in a <em>reported</em> file is below the threshold (i.e. the <em>reported</em> file contains less than X% rejected transactions): the <em>reporting</em> agent receives a request for correction of the erroneous transactions in the status message and the rejected transactions should be resent with CORR status. <p>(b) The number of erroneous transactions in a <em>reported</em> file is above the threshold (i.e. the <em>reported</em> file contains X% rejected transactions or more): the entire file is rejected. The <em>reporting</em> agent should send a corrected file showing the transactions with their initial status (e.g. if a transaction had status NEWT in the file initially submitted, then this transaction should also have status NEWT in the resubmitted file; if the status was CORR in the initial file it should be resubmitted as CORR, etc.). In addition, the status message sent to the <em>reporting</em> agent will contain &lsquo;RJCT&rsquo; in the &lsquo;ReportStatus&rsquo; in the Business Application Header (BAH), and also the status (RJCT/WARN) of the individual transactions. <p></div><ul><li><em>Money</em> <em>Market</em> <em>Statistical</em> <em>Reporting</em> (<em>MMSR</em>)<li>1 <em>Questions</em> regarding the implementation of Regulation ECB/2014/48<ul><li>1.1 Timeliness<li>1.2 Scope of <em>reporting</em><ul><li>1.2.1 Related to the secured <em>market</em> segment<li>1.2.2 Related to the unsecured <em>market</em> segment<li>1.2.3 Related to the FX swaps <em>market</em> segment<li>1.2.4 Related to the overnight index swaps <em>market</em> segment</ul><li>1.3 Revisions, re-negotiations and specific transaction conditions<li>1.4 Other</ul><li>2 <em>Questions</em> regarding the <em>reporting</em> requirements and field definitions<ul><li>2.1 General<li>2.2 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions in the BAH/<em>Reporting</em> Header<li>2.3 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for multiple segments<li>2.4 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the secured segment<li>2.5 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the unsecured segment<li>2.6 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the FX Swaps segment<li>2.7 <em>Questions</em> regarding specific field definitions for the OIS segment</ul><li>3 <em>Questions</em> regarding the IT implementation and the transmission of data</ul></body></html>
