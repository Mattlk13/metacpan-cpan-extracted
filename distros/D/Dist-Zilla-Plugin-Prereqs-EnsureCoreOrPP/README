SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Prereqs::EnsureCoreOrPP]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will check that all RuntimeRequires prereqs (and all their
    recursive RuntimeRequires deps) are all core/PP modules. To do this
    checking, all prereqs must be installed during build time and they all
    must be indexed by CPAN. Also, a reasonably fresh local CPAN mirror
    indexed (produced by App::lcpan) is required.

    I need this when building a dist that needs to be included in a
    fatpacked script.

    Note: I put this plugin in setup_installer phase instead of
    before_release because I don't always use "dzil release" (i.e. during
    offline deployment, I "dzil build" and "pause upload" separately.)
