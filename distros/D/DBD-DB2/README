*** *BEFORE* BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5 (Preferrably 5.006_00 or later)
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module (at least DBI 1.21).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    Remember to *read* the DBI README file and this one CAREFULLY!

    Ensure the following DB2 product is installed.

        DB2 Application Development Client v7.2 or later
            Included with the DB2 Personal Developer's Edition and the
            DB2 Universal Developer's Edition

    The Application Development Client can be downloaded here:

    http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/



*** BUILDING:

    On UNIX:
	export DB2_HOME=<path to CLI DRIVER installation>/clidriver
	export PERL5LIB=~/lib/perl5/lib/perl5/site_perl:$HOME/DBD-DB2-1.85/tests:$HOME/DBD-DB2-1.85/Constants
	
    perl Makefile.PL            # use a perl that's in your PATH
    make
    make test
    make install (if the tests look okay)
	
	NOTE: 
	For non root installation specify the installation into ~/lib/perl5 instead for non-root installation:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/lib/perl5
	make
	make test
	make install
	
	On Windows:

    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

*** TESTING:

    All Platforms:
    Edit the file connection.pl in the folder tests so that it looks like the following:

    $USERID="userid";
    $PASSWORD="password";
    $PORT=50000;
    $HOSTNAME="localhost";
    $DATABASE="database";
    $PROTOCOL="TCPIP";

    The next section has details about the trusted context user. If you dont have trusted users set specifically, then you may leave this section as is and the testcase for the trusted context would fail. This is an expected behavior.

    The details for fakeport etc can be left untouched.

    Run the test suite by running the following command:
    $ perl run-tests.pl

*** IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

    Please read the CAVEATS files which includes important
    information, including tips and workarounds for various
    platform-specific problems.
