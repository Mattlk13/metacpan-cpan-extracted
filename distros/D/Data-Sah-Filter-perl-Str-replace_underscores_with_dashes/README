NAME
    Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::replace_underscores_with_dashes - Replace
    underscores in string with dashes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::replace_underscores_with_dashes (from Perl
    distribution Data-Sah-Filter-perl-Str-replace_underscores_with_dashes),
    released on 2022-07-17.

SYNOPSIS
  Using in Sah schema's "prefilters" (or "postfilters") clause
     ["str","prefilters",[["Str::replace_underscores_with_dashes"]]]

  Using with Data::Sah:
     use Data::Sah qw(gen_validator);
 
     my $schema = ["str","prefilters",[["Str::replace_underscores_with_dashes"]]];
     my $validator = gen_validator($schema);
     if ($validator->($some_data)) { print 'Valid!' }

  Using with Data::Sah:Filter directly:
     use Data::Sah::Filter qw(gen_filter);

     my $filter = gen_filter([["Str::replace_underscores_with_dashes"]]);
     my $filtered_value = $filter->($some_data);

  Sample data and filtering results
     "foo" # valid, unchanged
     "foo_bar" # valid, becomes "foo-bar"

DESCRIPTION
    This is mostly created as a counterpart for the
    replace_dashes_with_underscores filter
    (Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::replace_dashes_with_underscores). So far
    I haven't got a practical use for this.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
