NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestMLIncluder - Ship your TestML version

VERSION

    This document describes Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestMLIncluder version
    0.14.

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

        [TestMLIncluder]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin allows you to ship your module with .t files
    written in the TestML <http://testml.org/> language rather then in
    Perl. Your module does not need to add any dependencies (like TestML)
    to do this.

    This plugin does the following (when you dzil build):

      * Adds the latest TestML sources into inc/lib/

      * Adds the testml-cpan program to inc/bin/

      * Modifies your TestML .t file's shebang lines to use testml-cpan

      * Precompiles your TestML files into inc/t/... files

    Not only does this make TestML easy to use for CPAN modules, it also
    ensures that the exact TestML code you tested with locally is being
    used by people installing your module. ie It makes your CPAN
    distribution future-proof to any TestML language changes.
