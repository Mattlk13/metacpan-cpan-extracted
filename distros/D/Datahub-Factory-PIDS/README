NAME

    Datahub::Factory::Importer::PIDS - Insert PIDS from an external source

SYNOPSIS

        use Datahub::Factory::Importer::PIDS;
        use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
    
        my $pids = Datahub::Factory::Importer::PIDS->new(
            username       => 'datahub',
            api_key        => 'datahub',
            container_name => 'datahub'
        );
    
        $pids->temporary_table($pids->get_object('test.csv'), 'id');

DESCRIPTION

    The module uses Catmandu to create a SQLite database from a CSV
    containing an export of the Resolver
    <https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/resolver> that can be used in Catmandu
    fixes to insert PIDS (Persistent Identifiers).

    The CSV's are stored on a protected Rackspace cloud files instance.

    It has absolutely no use outside of the Datahub
    <https://github.com/thedatahub/> use case.

PARAMETERS

    username

      Rackspace Cloud Files username to access the files.

    api_key

      API key for the Cloud Files user.

    container_name

      Name of the container where the files are stored. Optional, defaults
      to datahub.

METHODS

    get_object($filename)

      Get the object called $filename from the Cloud files instance and
      store it in /tmp. Only accepts CSV's.

      Returns the local path of the object it just fetched.

    temporary_table($csv_location, $id_column)

      Create a SQLite database (in /tmp) that stores the CSV that is stored
      in $csv_location. Create an _id column (as expected by
      Catmandu::Fix::lookup_in_store) in the database from the column in
      the CSV called $id_column.

      Returns nothing.
