=head1 NAME

C<Device::Chip::MCP3221> - chip driver for F<MCP3221>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Device::Chip::MCP3221;

 my $chip = Device::Chip::MCP3221->new;
 $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new )->get;

 printf "The reading is %d\n", $chip->read_adc->get;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Device::Chip> subclass provides specific communications to a
F<Microchip> F<MCP3221> chip.

The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of this chip;
the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define chip-specific
concepts or features, only the use of this module to access them.

=head1 MOUNT PARAMETERS

=head2 addr

The IÂ²C address of the device. Can be specified in decimal, octal or hex with
leading C<0> or C<0x> prefixes.

=cut

sub I2C_options
{
   my $self = shift;
   my %params = @_;

   my $addr = delete $params{addr} // 0x4D;
   $addr = oct $addr if $addr =~ m/^0/;

   return (
      addr        => $addr,
      max_bitrate => 400E3,
   );
}

=head1 METHODS

The following methods documented with a trailing call to C<< ->get >> return
L<Future> instances.

=cut

# Chip has no config registers
async sub read_config { return {} }
async sub change_config { }

=head2 read_adc

   $value = $chip->read_adc->get

Performs a conversion and returns the result as a plain unsigned 12-bit
integer.

=cut

async sub read_adc
{
   my $self = shift;

   my $buf = await $self->protocol->read( 2 );

   return unpack "S>", $buf;
}

=head2 read_adc_ratio

   $ratio = $chip->read_adc_ratio->get

Performs a conversion and returns the result as a floating-point number
between 0 and 1.

=cut

async sub read_adc_ratio
{
   my $self = shift;

   # MCP3221 is 12-bit
   return ( await $self->read_adc ) / 2**12;
}
