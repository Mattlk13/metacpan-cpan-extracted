NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CPAN::Mini::Inject::REST - Uploads to a
    CPAN::Mini::Inject mirror using CPAN::Mini::Inject::REST

DESCRIPTION

    Like Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Inject, this plugin is a release-stage plugin
    that uploads to a CPAN::Mini mirror. This one expects that the remote
    is a CPAN::Mini::Inject::REST server, since it uses
    CPAN::Mini::Inject::REST::Client::API to do it.

ATTRIBUTES

    This plugin extends CPAN::Mini::Inject::REST::Client::API and therefore
    all of its properties can be provided. A summary:

    host - Required - without the protocol.

    protocol - Optional. Defaults to http. This differs from the parent
    class, where it is required.

    port - Optional. Defaults to 80. This differs from the parent class,
    where it is required.

    username - Optional. Username for HTTP basic auth.

    password - Optional. Password for HTTP basic auth.
