NAME
    Dist::Util::Current - Guess the current Perl distribution name

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Dist::Util::Current (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Util-Current), released on 2022-11-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use Dist::Util::Current qw(my_dist);

     my $dist = my_dist();

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  my_dist
    Usage:

     my_dist(%opts) => STR|HASH

    Guess the current distribution (the Perl distribution associated with
    the source code) using one of several ways.

    Options:

    *   filename

        String. The path to source code file. If unspecified, will use file
        name retrieved from caller(0).

    *   package

        String. The caller's package. If unspecified, will use package name
        retrieved from caller(0).

    How the function works:

    1. $DIST
        If the caller's package defines a package variable $DIST, will
        return this.

    2. .packlist for module or supermodules
        Will check .packlist for module or supermodules. For example, if
        module is Algorithm::Backoff::Constant then will try to check for
        .packlist for "Algorithm::Backoff::Constant", "Algorithm::Backoff",
        and "Algorithm".

        For each found .packlist will read its contents and check whether
        the filename is listed. If yes, then we've found the distribution
        name and return it.

    3. .packlist in @INC
        Will check .packlist in directories listed in @INC. Will use
        Dist::Util's "list_dists()" for this.

        For each found .packlist will read its contents and check whether
        the filename is listed. If yes, then we've found the distribution
        name and return it.

    4. Try "this_dist()" against current directory and several levels up
        Will guess using App::ThisDist's "this_dist()" against the current
        directory and several levels up.

    If all of the above fails, we return undef.

    TODO: Query the OS's package manager.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
