	- update tilecache loader to new faceinfo/facedata format. this
          saves a lot of ram when creating the tilecache, and makes it
          faster, too, as only about 20mb instead of 130mb have to be read.
        - ix with nonzero offset but zero data aborts a running ix.
        - remove ncom support, which was disabeld forever.
        - require Digest::SHA and SHA3 modules for secure authentication.
        - new module Deliantra::Util.
        - remove lots of cruft not needed for deliantra server >3.0.
        - support $face->{cache} slot for protocol users.
        - use spellmon v2 protocol (no message).

        - do not depend on IO::Socket::INET.
        - remember the last ix offset per face, to allow progress displays.

          use the exti resource/fxix mechanism.
        - support a generic addme delay mechanism using guards.

          as they are not needed for deliantra.
