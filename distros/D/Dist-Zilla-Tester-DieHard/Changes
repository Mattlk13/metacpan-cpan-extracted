Release history for perl-Dist-Zilla-Tester-DieHard

v0.6.4 @ 2016-12-18 08:53 UTC

    -   Bug #117511: installation test failure (missing updated error text from
        Dist::Zilla::Tester). Test fails because `Dist::Zilla` changed the error message. Test was
        rewritten to use double dot ("..") as invalid file name. It seems it is the most portable
        bad file name from all checked variants.

v0.6.3 @ 2015-11-16 23:22 UTC

    -   I do not know how to let `Dist::Zilla` < 5.023 die in `from_config` but before constructing
        a builder on `MSWin32` (and `Cygwin`). So the test is skipped in such conditions.

v0.6.2 @ 2015-11-11 23:05 UTC

    -   Another attempt to make test work on MSWin32 + old `Dist::Zilla`: `Dist::Zilla` before
        5.023 does not die in case of file name with backslash.

    -   Bug in test found: `autodie` is not applied to inner package. Fixed.

v0.6.1 @ 2015-11-10 13:20 UTC

    -   New test (`from_config` dies before constructing builder) fails on some OSes. This is an
        attempt to use different approaches on MSWin-like OSes (file name with backslash) and other
        OSes (read-only temporary directory).

v0.6.0 @ 2015-11-09 21:35 UTC

    -   `Survivor` saves chrome instead of logger. It allows to reuse `Dist::Zilla::Tester` code
        better: consuming `Dist::Zilla::Tester:_Role` brings few methods "for free". For example:
        `log_messages` (was implemented before, now explicit implementation is not needed),
        `log_events`, `clear_log_events` (new methods).

    -   There was a problem: if `from_config` dies before constructing builder, `DieHard` did not
        work well. Namely, constructing survivor failed in such a case due to undefined logger.
        The problem fixed.

    -   Documentation updated.

v0.5.0 @ 2015-10-26 21:38 UTC

    -   `release` method added.

    -   Documentation fixed a bit: `DieHard` is not a replacement, but an extension of
        `Dist::Zilla::Tester`.

v0.4.1 @ 2015-10-22 14:52 UTC

    -   Infrastructure updated to work with the latest `@Author::VDB` plugin bundle.

    -   `aspell.en.pws` renamed to `aspell-en.pws` to make `Test::Portability` happy.

    -   Minor changes in Synopsis to make `Test::Synopsis` happy.

    -   Short version of license notice is used in the documentation.

v0.4.0 @ 2015-09-17 16:57 UTC

    -   `from_config` warns if exception is caught *and* logger is undefined. I hope this will help
        to debug `Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Manifest::Read` test failure on `MSWin32` machines.
    -   Version switched from old decimal style to new dotted-decimal style.

0.003 @ 2015-09-15 12:31 UTC

    -   The test explicitly requires `Path::Tiny` v0.59 in spite it is not used directly by the
        test (`Path::Tiny` is used by `Dist::Zilla`). Earlier version of `Path::Tiny` may cause
        test failure due to exception "Can't locate Unicode/UTF8.pm in @INC" thrown from
        `Path::Tiny`.

0.002 @ 2015-08-15 13:26 UTC

    -   Undocumented prefix `[DieHard] ` stripped from rethrown exception. The exception is
        rethrown in original form, without stringifying, as described in documentation.
    -   Documentation improved a bit, added abstraction, etc.

0.001 @ 2015-08-14 22:44 UTC

    -   Initial revision
