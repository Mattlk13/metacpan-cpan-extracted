SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Acme::CPANLists::Blacklist]
     module_list=PERLANCAR::Modules I'm avoiding

    During build, if there is a prereq to a module listed in the above
    list, the build process will be aborted.

DESCRIPTION

    Acme::CPANLists::* modules contains various author lists and module
    lists. With this plugin, you can specify a blacklist to modules in
    those lists.

    If you specify a module list, e.g.:

     module_list=SomeNamespace::some name

    then a module called Acme::CPANLists::SomeNamespace will be loaded, and
    some name will be searched inside its @Module_Lists variable. If a list
    with such name is found, then all modules listed in that list will be
    added to the blacklist. (Otherwise, an error will be thrown if the list
    is not found.)

    To specify more lists, add more module_list= lines.

    Later in the build, when a prereq is specified against one of the
    blacklisted modules, an error message will be thrown and the build
    process aborted.

    To whitelist a module, list it in the Whitelist configuration in
    dist.ini:

     [Acme::CPANLists::Whitelist]
     module=Log::Any

    To whitelist more modules, add more module= lines.

    You can also specify an author list, e.g.:

     author_list=SomeNamespace::some name

    in which @Author_Lists variable will be searched instead of
    @Module_Lists. And local CPAN mirror database (built using lcpan) will
    be consulted to search the authors for all specified prereqs in the
    build. Then, if an author is blacklisted, an error message will be
    thrown and the build process aborted.

    As with modules, you can also whitelist some authors:

     [Acme::CPANLists::Whitelist]
     author=PERLANCAR
