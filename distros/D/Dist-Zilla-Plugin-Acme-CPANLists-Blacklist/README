NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Acme::CPANLists::Blacklist - Blacklist prereqs
    using a CPANList module/author list

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Acme::CPANLists::Blacklist (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Acme-CPANLists-Blacklist), released on 2017-07-28.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Acme::CPANLists::Blacklist]
     module_list=PERLANCAR::Modules I'm avoiding

    During build, if there is a prereq to a module listed in the above list,
    the build process will be aborted.

    Currently prereqs with custom phase (/^x_/) or custom relationship are
    ignored.

DESCRIPTION
    "Acme::CPANLists::*" modules contains various author lists and module
    lists. With this plugin, you can specify a blacklist to modules in those
    lists.

    If you specify a module list, e.g.:

     module_list=SomeNamespace::some name

    then a module called "Acme::CPANLists::SomeNamespace" will be loaded,
    and "some name" will be searched inside its @Module_Lists variable. If a
    list with such name is found, then all modules listed in that list will
    be added to the blacklist. (Otherwise, an error will be thrown if the
    list is not found.)

    To specify more lists, add more "module_list=" lines.

    Later in the build, when a prereq is specified against one of the
    blacklisted modules, an error message will be thrown and the build
    process aborted.

    To whitelist a module, list it in the Whitelist configuration in
    dist.ini:

     [Acme::CPANLists::Whitelist]
     module=Log::Any

    To whitelist more modules, add more "module=" lines.

    You can also specify an author list, e.g.:

     author_list=SomeNamespace::some name

    in which @Author_Lists variable will be searched instead of
    @Module_Lists. And local CPAN mirror database (built using lcpan) will
    be consulted to search the authors for all specified prereqs in the
    build. Then, if an author is blacklisted, an error message will be
    thrown and the build process aborted.

    As with modules, you can also whitelist some authors:

     [Acme::CPANLists::Whitelist]
     author=PERLANCAR
