SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [PodnameFromFilename]

    In your module/script:

     # PODNAME:

    During build, PODNAME will be filled from filename. If PODNAME is
    already filled, will leave it alone.

DESCRIPTION

    It's yet another DRY plugin. It's annoying that in scripts like
    bin/some-progname you have to specify:

     # PODNAME: some-progname

    With this plugin, the value of PODNAME directive will be filled from
    filename (unless it has been set explicitly).
