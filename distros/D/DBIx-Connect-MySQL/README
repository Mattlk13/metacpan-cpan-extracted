NAME
    DBIx::Connect::MySQL - Connect to DBI (mysql), search user/password from
    .my.cnf

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of DBIx::Connect::MySQL (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-Connect-MySQL), released on 2017-08-16.

SYNOPSIS
    Instead of:

     use DBI;
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", "someuser", "somepass");

    you can now do:

     use DBIx::Connect::MySQL;
     my $dbh = DBIx::Connect::MySQL->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", undef, undef);

    and user/password will be searched in ~/.my.cnf if unset.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a small wrapper for "DBI->connect" because the client library
    does not automatically search for user/password from .my.cnf files like
    in PostgresSQL.

METHODS
  connect($dsn, $user, $pass, ...)
    Will pass arguments to "DBI->connect" after setting the default of $user
    and $pass from ~/.my.cnf if possible.
