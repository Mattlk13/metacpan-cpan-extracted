NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic::Subset - Tests to check your
    code against best practices

VERSION
    version 3.001.006

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [Test::Perl::Critic]
        critic_config = perlcritic.rc ; default / relative to project root

        ; to add some files/dirs
        ;file = t/mytest.t
        ;file = t/myothertest.t
        ;dir  = xt

        ; to exclude some files/dirs by regex
        skip  = todo
        skip  = lib/Bencher/ScenarioR/

        ; you can also specify finders to include/exclude files
        ;finder = :TestFiles
        ;finder = :InstallModules

    Another example of specifying finders, by defining a custom finder (see
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::ByName for more details):

        [FileFinder::ByName / MyFiles]
        dir = lib
        dir = script
        file = *.t
        skip = lib/Bencher/ScenarioR/

        [Test::Perl::Critic]
        finder = MyFiles

DESCRIPTION
    Fork notice: This is a temporary fork of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic 3.001 which includes
    <https://github.com/perlancar/operl-Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Test-Perl-Critic/c
    ommit/bd46961d9d7da767f7a431fba13de441db4b6848> to add "finder" and
    "files" configuration options. These options let you select, include,
    exclude files to be tested.

    This will provide a xt/author/critic.t file for use during the "test"
    and "release" calls of "dzil". To use this, make the changes to dist.ini
    above and run one of the following:

        dzil test
        dzil release

    During these runs, xt/author/critic.t will use Test::Perl::Critic to run
    Perl::Critic against your code and by report findings.

    This plugin accepts the "critic_config" option, which specifies your own
    config file for Perl::Critic. It defaults to "perlcritic.rc", relative
    to the project root. If the file does not exist, Perl::Critic will use
    its defaults.

    This plugin is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
  critic_config
    Specify a perl critic profile. Will be passed to Test::Perl::Critic's
    "-profile" import option.

  finder
    This is the name of a FileFinder for finding files to check. The default
    value is ":InstallModules", ":ExecFiles", ":TestFiles" (see also
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir); this option can be used more than once.

    Other predefined finders are listed in "default_finders" in
    Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser. You can define your own with the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::ByName plugin.

  file
    A filename to also test, in addition to any files found earlier. This
    option can be repeated to specify multiple additional files.
