VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Date::TimeOfDay (from Perl
    distribution Date-TimeOfDay), released on 2022-09-22.

SYNOPSIS
     use Date::TimeOfDay;

     my $tod = Date::TimeOfDay->new(
         hour=>23, minute=>59, second=>59,
         # nanosecond => 999_999_999, # optional
     );

DESCRIPTION
    EARLY RELEASE, API MIGHT CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

    This is a simple module to represent time of day. Interface is modelled
    after DateTime. Internal representation is currently float (number of

    nor time zone.

    TODO:

     * set
     * strftime
     * add DateTime + TimeOfDay
     * add TimeOfDay + TimeOfDay
     * convert to duration
     * convert to another time zone

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
