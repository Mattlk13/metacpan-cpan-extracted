NAME

Data::Money::Converter - Moo Role for Data::Money Converters.

DESCRIPTION

This simple  module provides a base for building currency conversion backends for
L<Data::Money>. You can use  this module either as a basis for understanding the
the common features or as a guide for implmenting your own converter.

SYNOPSIS

    package MoneyConverter;

    use Moo;
    use namespace::clean;
    with 'Data::Money::Converter';

    sub convert {
        my ($self, $money, $code) = @_;

        return $money->clone(
            value => $money->value * 2,
            code  => $code
        );
    }

    1;

METHODS

This role requires that you  implement  a C<convert> method. It should expect two
arguments: an isntance of L<Data::Money> and a 3-character currency code. It does
not do any checking of the code as not all conversion implementations may support
all codes.  It is recommended that you consult L<Locale::Currency>.
