=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::Plicease - Dist::Zilla plugins used by Plicease

=head1 VERSION

version 2.41

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution contains some miscellaneous plugins that I use
that should probably not be of any use to anyone else.  Historically
they were used and included by my bundle C<[@Author::Plicease]>, but
I've separated them into their own distribution so they can be
installed without the the full set of prereqs required by the bundle.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 dist_dir

 my $dir = Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::Plicease->dist_dir;

Returns this distributions share directory.
