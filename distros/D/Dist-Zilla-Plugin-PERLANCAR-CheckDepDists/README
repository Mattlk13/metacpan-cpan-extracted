SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [PERLANCAR::CheckDepDists]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin notifies you, in the after_build phase, of dists that might
    need to be rebuild too, because those dists depend on the dist you're
    building. Currently what it does:

      * Search your local installation for all lump dists (via searching
      all modules whose name ends with ::Lumped). Inside each of these
      modules, there is a @LUMPED_DISTS array which lists all the dists
      that the lump dist includes. When the current dist you're building is
      listed in @LUMPED_DISTS, the plugin will issue a notification that
      you will also need to rebuild the associated lump dist.

      * Search your local installation for all packed dists (via searching
      all modules whose name ends with ::Packed, ::Fatpacked,
      ::DataPacked). Inside each of these modules, there is a @PACKED_DISTS
      array which lists all the dists that the packed dist includes. When
      the current dist you're building is listed in @PACKED_DISTS, the
      plugin will issue a notification that you will also need to rebuild
      the associated packed dist.

      * Search ../ (XXX probably should be configurable) for all repos
      (dirs) that contains tag file .tag-requires-dist-DISTNAME where
      DISTNAME is the current distribution's name.
