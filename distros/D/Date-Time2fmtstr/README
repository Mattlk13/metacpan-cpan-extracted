SYNOPSIS
            use Date::Time2fmtstr;

            my $timestring = time2str(time, 'mm-dd-yyyy hh:mi PM');

            die $timestring  if ($timestring =~ /^e\:/);

            print "Current date/time (formatted):  $timestring.\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Date::Time2fmtstr provides a single function time2str that accepts a
    standard Perl (Unix) "time" value (a large integer equivalent to the
    number of seconds since 1980) and converts it to a string value based on
    a *format-string* consisting of special substrings which represent the
    various parts of a date and time value. It returns a string that is
    essentially the same as the original *format-string* with each of these
    special substrings replaced with the corresponding date/time value.

METHODS
    $string = time2str(*time*, *format-string*);
        Returns a string corresponding to the specified *format-string* with
        each special substring replaced with the corresponding date/time
        data field.

        For example:

                $s = &time2str(1452324044, 'mm-dd-yyyy hh:mi PM (Day) (Month)');

        would set $s to '01-09-2016 01:20 AM (Sat) (January)'.

    Special Formatting Substrings
        There are numerous choices of special format substrings which can be
        used in an infinite number of combinations to produce the desired
        results. They are listed below:

            a, p - display "a" if between Midnight and Noon, "p" otherwise
            (both specifiers are identical).

            A, P - display "A" if between Midnight and Noon, "P" otherwise
            (both specifiers are identical).

            am, pm - display "am" if between Midnight and Noon, "pm"
            otherwise (both specifiers are identical).

            AM, PM - display "AM" if between Midnight and Noon, "PM"
            otherwise (both specifiers are identical).

            day - Three letter abbreviation of the day of the week in all
            lower case, ie. "sun".

            Day - Three letter abbreviation of the day of the week
            capitalized, ie. "Sun".

            DAY - Three letter abbreviation of the day of the week all
            capitalized, ie. "SUN".

            dayofweek - Day of the week in all lower case, ie. "sunday".

            Dayofweek - Day of the week capitalized, ie. "Sunday".

            DAYOFWEEK - Day of the week all capitalized, ie. "SUNDAY".

            ddd - Num. of days since beginning of year. NOTE: This is
            calculated by adding the number of SECONDS (86400 per day) to
            midnight, 1/1/current-year, so if spanning a daylight-savings
            time boundary may result in +1 hour difference, which the
            underlying Perl localtime/timelocal functions will take into
            account! For example, if the current time was "1570286966"
            (2019/10/05 09:49:26), the following code:

            print &time2str(&str2time(&time2str(1570286966, 'ddd,
            hh:mi:ss'), 'ddd, hh:mi:ss'), 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mi:ss') . "\n";

            would print "2019/10/05 10:49:26" due to the fact that 1 hour
            (3600 seconds) was automatically skipped over when DST was
            imposed between 1 January and 5 October. This "feature" only
            applies when calculating the date/time based on days since
            beginning of the year ("ddd").

            dd - Day of month (2 digits, left padded with a zero if needed),
            ie. "03" for March.

            ... Saturday=6).

            d1 - Day of month (1 or 2 digits, as needed), ie. "3" for March.

            hh - Hour in common format (left padded with a zero if needed
            for 2 digits), ie. 01-12.

            hhmi - Hours and minutes in 12-hour time (hours and minutes no
            colon, left padded with a zero if needed for 4 digits).

            hhmiss - Hours, minutes and seconds in 12-hour time (no colon,
            left padded with a zero if needed for 6 digits).

            hh24, HHmi - Military time (hours and minutes: 24 hours, no
            colon), left padded with a zero if needed for 4 digits).

            h1 - Hour in common format, 1 or 2 digits, as needed, ie. 1-12.
            (see AM and PM specifiers).

            h1mi - Hours and minutes in 12-hour time (hours and minutes no
            colon). Returns 3 or 4 digits as needed.

            if needed, ie. 00-23.
