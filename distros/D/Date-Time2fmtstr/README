SYNOPSIS
    use Date::Time2fmtstr;

    print time2str(time, 'mm-dd-yyyy hh:mi PM');

DESCRIPTION
    Date::Time2fmtstr provides a single function time2str that accepts a
    standard Perl (Unix) "time" value (a large integer equivalent to the
    number of seconds since 1980) and converts it to a string value based on
    a *format-string* consisting of special substrings which represent the
    various parts of a date and time value. It returns a string that is
    essentially the same as the original *format-string* with each of these
    special substrings replaced with the corresponding date/time value.

METHODS
    <$string> = time2str(*time*, *format-string*);
        Returns a string corresponding to the specified *format-string* with
        each special substring replaced with the corresponding date/time
        data field. For example:

        $s = time2str(1452324044, 'mm-dd-yyyy hh:mi PM (Day) (Month)');

        would set $s to '01-09-2016 01:20 AM (Sat) (January)'.

    Special Formatting Substrings
        There are numerous choices of special format substrings which can be
        used in an infinite number of combinations to produce the desired
