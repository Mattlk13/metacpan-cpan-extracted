DESCRIPTION

    The standard DeploymentHandler storage only stores the version of the
    schema. This means you can't deploy multiple DH-handled DBIC schemata
    into the same database.

    This module has an extra column to store the schema that it is
    deploying as well as the version.

    To use it, you'll have to create a new subclass of
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad that uses this module instead of
    the standard one, and instantiate that in your script instead.

SEE ALSO

    This module implements
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::HandlesVersionStorage and is similar to
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::VersionStorage::Standard.
