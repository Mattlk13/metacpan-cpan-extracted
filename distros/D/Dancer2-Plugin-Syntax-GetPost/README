NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::Syntax::GetPost - Syntactic sugar for GET+POST handlers

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      use Dancer2::Plugin::Syntax::GetPost;

      get_post '/myform' => sub { ... };

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides very simple syntactic sugar to define a handler for
    GET and POST requests. Instead of writing this:

      any [qw/get post/] => '/form' => sub { ... };

    You can write just this:

      get_post '/form' => sub { ... };
