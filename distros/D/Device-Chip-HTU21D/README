NAME

    Device::Chip::HTU21D - chip driver for HTU21D

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::HTU21D;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::HTU21D->new;
       $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new )->get;
    
       printf "Current temperature is is %.2f C\n",
          $chip->read_temperature->get;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a TE
    Connectivity HTU21D attached to a computer via an I²C adapter.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

ACCESSORS

    The following methods documented with a trailing call to ->get return
    Future instances.

 read_config

       $config = $chip->read_config->get

    Returns a HASH reference of the contents of the user register.

       RES        => "12/14" | "11/11" | "10/13" | "8/12"
       OTPDISABLE => 0 | 1
       HEATER     => 0 | 1
       ENDOFBATT  => 0 | 1

 change_config

       $chip->change_config( %changes )->get

    Writes updates to the user register.

METHODS

 read_temperature

       $temperature = $chip->read_temperature->get

    Triggers a reading of the temperature sensor, returning a number in
    degrees C.

 read_humidity

       $humidity = $chip->read_humidity->get

    Triggers a reading of the humidity sensor, returning a number in % RH.
