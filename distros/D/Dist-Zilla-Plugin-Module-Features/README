NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Module::Features - Plugin to use when building
    Module::Features::* distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Module::Features (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Module-Features), released on 2021-08-27.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Module::Features]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is to be used when building "Module::Features::*"
    distribution as well as distribution that has a module that declares
    features. It currently does the following:

    *   Create "xt/release/module-features.t" test file which uses
        Test::Module::Features to test your features declarations or feature
        set specifications

    *   Make sure that Module::Features is added as a (phase=develop,
        rel=x_spec) prerequisite

        This is a way to express that the module *follows the specification*
        specified in Module::Features. This recommendation is per
        Module::Features spec.

    *   For a feature declarer module, make sure that the appropriate
        "Module::Features::*" modules are added as (phase=develop,
        rel=x_features_from) prerequisites

        This is a way to express that the module declares features defined
        in the associated "Module::Features::*" modules. This recommendation
        is per Module::Features spec.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
