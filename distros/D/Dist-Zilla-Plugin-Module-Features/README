SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Module::Features]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is to be used when building "Module::Features::*"
    distribution as well as distribution that has a module that declares
    features. It currently does the following:

    *   Create "xt/release/module-features.t" test file which uses
        Test::Module::Features to test your features declarations or feature
        set specifications

    *   Make sure that Module::Features is added as a (phase=develop,
        rel=x_spec) prerequisite

        This is a way to express that the module *follows the specification*
        specified in Module::Features.
