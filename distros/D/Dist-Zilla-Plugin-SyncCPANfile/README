    listed in dist.ini

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

        # in dist.ini
        [SyncCPANfile]
    
        # configure it yourself
        [SyncCPANfile]
        filename = my-cpanfile
        comment  = This is my cpanfile

    Unlike Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CPANFile this plugin does not add a
    cpanfile to the distribution but to the "disk".

CONFIG

 filename

    With this config you can change the filename for the file. It defaults
    to cpanfile.

        [SyncCPANfile]
        filename = my-cpanfile

 comment

    The default comment says, that the cpanfile was generated by this
    plugin. You can define your own comment.

        [SyncCPANfile]
        comment  = This is my cpanfile
        comment  = line 2
