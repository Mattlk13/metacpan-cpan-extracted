Data::Record::Serialize

Data::Record::Serialize encodes data records and sends them somewhere.
This module is primarily useful for output of sets of uniformly
structured data records. It provides a uniform, thin, interface to
various serializers and output sinks. Its *raison d'etre* is its ability
to manipulate the records prior to encoding and output.

*   A record is a collection of fields, i.e. keys and *scalar* values.

*   All records are assumed to have the same structure.

*   Fields may have simple types which may be determined automatically.
    Some encoders use this information during encoding.

*   Fields may be renamed upon output

*   A subset of the fields may be selected for output.

*   Fields may be formatted via "sprintf" prior to output

  Encoders

The available encoders and their respective documentation are:

*   "dbi" - Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::dbi

    Write to a database via DBI. This is a combined encoder and sink.

*   "ddump" - Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::ddump

    encode via Data::Dumper

*   "json" - Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::json

*   "null" - send the data to the bit bucket. This is a combined encoder
    and sink.

*   "rdb" - Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::rdb

*   "yaml" - Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::yaml

  Sinks

Sinks are where encoded data are sent.

The available sinks and their documentation are:

*   "stream" - Data::Record::Serialize::Sink::stream

*   "null" - send the encoded data to the bit bucket.

  Types

Some output encoders care about the type of a field.
Data::Record::Serialize recognizes three types:

*   "N" - Numeric

*   "I" - Integral

*   "S" - String

Not all encoders support a separate integral type; in those cases
integer fields are treated as general numeric fields.

  Output field and type determination

The selection of output fields and determination of their types depends
upon the "fields", "types", and "default_type" attributes.

*   "fields" specified, "types" *not* specified

    The fields in "fields" are output. Types are derived from the values
    in the first record.

*   "fields" *not* specified, "types" specified

    The fields by "types" are output and are given the specified types.

*   "fields" specified, "types" specified

    The fields specified by the "fields" array are output with the types
    specified by "types". For fields not specified in "types", the
    "default_type" attribute value is used.

*   "fields" *not* specified, "types" *not* specified

    The first record determines the fields and types (by examination).
