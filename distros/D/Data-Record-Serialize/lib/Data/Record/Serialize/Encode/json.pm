=head1 NAME

Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::json - encoded a record as JSON

=head1 VERSION

version 0.25

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Record::Serialize;

    my $s = Data::Record::Serialize->new( encode => 'json', ... );

    $s->send( \%record );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::json> encodes a record as JSON.

If a field's type is C<N> or C<I>, it will be properly encoded by JSON
as a number.  Field's with type C<S> are force to be strings.

Boolean fields (type C<B>) are transformed into values recognized by
the back-end encoder.

The output consists of I<concatenated> JSON objects, and is mostly easily
read by an incremental decoder, e.g.

  use JSON::MaybeXS;

  @data = JSON->new->incr_parse( $json );

It performs the L<Data::Record::Serialize::Role::Encode> role.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 to_bool

   $bool = $self->to_bool( $truthy );

Convert a truthy value to something that the JSON encoders will recognize as a boolean.
