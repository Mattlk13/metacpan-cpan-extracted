    Implements the required munge_file method for the
    Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger role, munging each Perl file it finds.
    Files whose names do not end in .pm, .pl, or .t, or whose contents do
    not begin with #!perl are left alone.

        # dist.ini
        [PerlTidy]
    
        # or
        [PerlTidy]
