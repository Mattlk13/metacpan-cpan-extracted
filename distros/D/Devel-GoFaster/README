NAME

Devel::GoFaster - optimise executable Perl ops

DESCRIPTION

This module implements some optimisations in compiled Perl code, which
should make it run slightly faster without visibly affecting behaviour.
The optimisations are applied at the peephole optimisation step,
augmenting Perl's built-in optimisations.

INSTALLATION
