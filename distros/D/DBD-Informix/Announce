Subject: ANNOUNCE: Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2018.1029 (2018-10-28) released

Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2018.1029 (2018-10-28) has been uploaded to CPAN.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (also known as DBD::Informix) is
the driver code that enables Perl :PERL_MINVERSION: or later to access Informix
databases via the DBI module (but if you are not already using Perl
:PERL_REFVERSION:, or a later version, you should be planning to upgrade Perl).
You will need to install DBI version :DBI_MINVERSION: or later as well (version :DBI_REFVERSION:,
or any later version, is recommended) before installing DBD::Informix.  The
code for DBD::Informix is available for download via:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build this module, use the ItWorks (Perl)
** script to report your configuration to the maintenance team (meaning
** Jonathan Leffler) at dbd.informix@gmail.com.
** The ItWorks script does not send email to anybody; you have to do
** that yourself.

New in release 2018.1029

* Remove support for compilation with C4GL instead of ESQL/C.
* Rework the linking process to exploit 'esql -libs' always.

  alone Vista, Windows 7, 8 or 10)
* Simplify support for HP-UX and Solaris.

* Remove source code added solely to support unsupported versions of
  ESQL/C.
* Remove many conditional compilation fragments for unsupported versions
  of ESQL/C.

New in release 2015.1101:
* Trivial bug fix for the 2015.1031 release.
* The ghosties and ghoulies crept in!

New in release 2015.1031:
* This is basically a minor bug-fix release.
* RT#108030 about mismanaging the name of the Perl binary in Makefile.PL
  is fixed.
* RT#108031 is about a missing (actually, misnamed) file in the MANIFEST.

New in release 2015.0826:
* Automatically deal with Perl and DBI minimum versions since the previous
  releases had a mish-mash of version numbers scattered through the code.
* Fix DBD::Informix::TechSupport module, thereby fixing the TechSupport and
  ItWorks scripts too.
* Note that with effect from the first release from 2016-01-01 onwards,
  DBD::Informix will no longer support any version of ClientSDK prior to
  version 3.50, the oldest version currently supported by IBM.  The support
  code for some of the older versions of ESQL/C will be removed over time.
  You're welcome to try using older versions, but if anything goes wrong,
  you will need to upgrade.

Support email address:
* This release is supported by Jonathan Leffler <dbd.informix@gmail.com>.
* You may also report your bugs via the CPAN resolution tracking system:
    http://rt.cpan.org/
* Such bug reports can be sent by email to bug-DBD-Informix@rt.cpan.org;
  they also get sent to dbd.informix@gmail.com, etc.

As always, see the ChangeLog file for details about what has changed.
