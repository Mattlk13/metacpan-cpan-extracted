NAME

    Device::Chip::BNO055 - chip driver for BNO055

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::BNO055;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::BNO055->new;
       $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new )->get;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communications to a Bosch
    BNO055 orientation sensor chip.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

METHODS

    The following methods documented with a trailing call to ->get return
    Future instances.

 read_ids

       $ids = $chip->read_ids->get

    Returns an 8-character string composed of the four ID registers. For a
    BNO055 chip this should be the string

       "A0FB320F"

 read_config

       $config = $chip->read_config->get

    Returns the current chip configuration.

 change_config

       $chip->change_config( %changes )->get

    Changes the configuration. Any field names not mentioned will be
    preserved at their existing values.

    This method can only be used while the chip is in config mode, and
    cannot itself be used to set OPR_MODE. For that, use "set_opr_mode".

 set_opr_mode

       $chip->set_opr_mode( $mode )->get

    Sets the OPR_MODE register.

 read_accelerometer_raw

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_accelerometer_raw->get

    Returns the most recent accelerometer readings in raw 16bit signed
    integers

 read_accelerometer

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_accelerometer->get

    Returns the most recent accelerometer readings in converted units,
    either m/s² or G depending on the chip's ACC_Unit configuration.

 read_magnetometer_raw

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_magnetometer_raw->get

    Returns the most recent magnetometer readings in raw 16bit signed
    integers

 read_magnetometer

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_magnetometer->get

    Returns the most recent magnetometer readings in converted units of µT.

 read_gyroscope_raw

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_gyroscope_raw->get

    Returns the most recent gyroscope readings in raw 16bit signed integers

 read_gyroscope

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_gyroscope->get

    Returns the most recent gyroscope readings in converted units, either
    dps or rps depending on the chip's GYR_Unit configuration.

 read_euler_angles

       ( $heading, $roll, $pitch ) = $chip->read_euler_angles->get

    Returns the most recent Euler angle fusion readings in converted units,
    either degrees or radians depending on the chip's EUL_units
    configuration.

 read_quarternion

       ( $w, $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_quarternion->get

    Returns the most recent quarternion fusion readings in converted units
    as scaled numbers between -1 and 1.

 read_linear_acceleration

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_linear_acceleration->get

    Returns the most recent linear acceleration fusion readings in
    converted units, either m/s² or G depending on the chip's ACC_units
    configuration.

 read_linear_acceleration

       ( $x, $y, $z ) = $chip->read_linear_acceleration->get

    Returns the most recent gravity fusion readings in converted units,
    either m/s² or G depending on the chip's ACC_units configuration.
