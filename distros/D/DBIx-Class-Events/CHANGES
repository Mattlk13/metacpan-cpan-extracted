    Simplify Makefile

    Rather than assuming plenv, just add a requirement that we have
    carton available and remove some of our other internal only features.

    Don't let $Carp::Verbose confuse expected exception

    If you have PERL5OPT=-MCarp=verbose or something similar, this test
    would fail, so force Carp not to be verbose when we don't want it to.

    Don't pass all modified columns as event params

    If one of the modified columns on the tracked object matches a unique
    column on the tracking table it will do the Wrong Thing. The easiest
    to describe is if both tables have the same name for the PK, perhaps
    "id". If you insert and then update a record, the tracking table will
    now have a MAX(id) of 2 so if you try to insert another tracked item
    it will insert id 2 and try to insert an event with the same id and
    violate the unique constraint as well as not doing what you'd want.

    Add tests for events with key that matches default

    This currently fails as we attempt to copy all changed columns to the
    event, which may have the same name as a unique column.

    SM-1325: Add test dep for JSON::PP

    According to corelist, JSON::PP was first released with perl v5.13.9,
    so it's best to include the dep in cpanfile.

    Improve documentation.

    * Document that we don't support bulk actions

    That is, if you call update or delete on a ResultSet it won't create

    events for all effected objects in the database.

    I think that's pretty obvious from the "triggers" wording in the

    ResultSet documentation, so point folks there.

    * Document the three required columns for the events table and that

    we should allow you to configure their names.

    * More clearly document where "name_change" and "last_name_change"

    are from because it's a useful idiom and one we use a lot in our
    actual

    code, but this forced example doesn't clearly show why it exists.

    * Attempt to clarify how event_defaults and the %params are used

    by the event method

    * More clearly show that we are updating a value in the "details",

    and were just rewriting the whole thing to dirty the column.

    * List possible uses in a list so we can more easily add more as we

    think of them.

    * List PRECONFIGURED EVENTS as items

    if we do, then test coverage will note that we have them documented,

    which probably would be important if we ever add Pod::Coverage tests.

    * Suggest indexing triggered_on before event as that has better

    cardinality

    * Move SETUP methods and attributes under CONFIGURATION

    Remove the `event_columns` method

    It turns out that it doesn't really accomplish much, if someone
    passes in columns, we probably want to update them if they exist.

    The fact that I didn't break any tests probably means it wasn't a
    good feature anyway.

    Don't force triggered_on in event_defaults

    Because we can mock what SQLite does and just use a database default
    instead.

    Spell it column not field

    That is the way it is documented in DBIx::Class, so keep with that
    more correct terminology.

    Revert "Optimize state_at to only look for columns we need"

    This added complexity and possible source of bugs does not seem to be
    worth the code to do it.

    This reverts commit bcd2b3d5351539e09c5d21615ddced6129e1e7ed.

    Optimize state_at to only look for columns we need

    To work, we assume primary columns won't change in state_at, this may
    not be a good guess, but it *seems* likely

    we don't actually care about.

    as a class method.
