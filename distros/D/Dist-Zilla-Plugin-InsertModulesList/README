DESCRIPTION
    This plugin finds "# INSERT_MODULES_LIST" directive in your POD/code and
    replace it with a POD containing list of modules in the distribution.

    To exclude a module from the generated list, use:

     # INSERT_MODULES_LIST -Foo::Bar -Baz ...

    To exclude modules matching a regex, use:

     # INSERT_MODULES_LIST -/^Foo::Bar::(Helper|Util)/

    To only include modules matching a regex, use:

     Below are the included plugins in this distribution:

     # INSERT_MODULES_LIST /^Foo::Plugin::/

    Excludes and includes can be combined.

CONFIGURATION
  ordered
    Bool. Can be set to true to always generate an ordered list, or false to
    always generate an unordered list. If unset, will use unordered list for
    6 or less items and ordered list otherwise.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
