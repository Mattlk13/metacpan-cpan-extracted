Revision history for Perl module DB::Object

v0.10.2 2021-08-30T02:57:37Z +0900
    - Added missing parameter cache_connection among acceptable connection parameters
    - Added DB::Object::Placeholder class to better handle placeholders embedded in expressions
    - Updated DB::Object::Fields::Field and DB::Object::Query->_where_having to use placeholder objects
    - Improved DB::Object::Fields::Field so that it accepts values as-is when they are passed as scalar reference
    - Added methods dollar_placeholder and server_prepare in DB::Object::Postgres::Query to influence the prepare statement for the ongoing statement
    - Added method name in DB::Object::Postgres::Statement to set/get a name for the statement.
    - Modified _cache_this() to enable passing prepare options enabled in DB::Object::Query
    - Minor improvement in DB::Object::connect

v0.10.1 2021-08-29T16:13:07Z +0900
    - Correcting minor bug in DB::Object::Postgres::Statement->disable_trigger

v0.10.0 2021-08-29T12:03:12Z +0900
    - Added method get_sql_type() to get driver specific constant called in DB::Object::Query and sub classes
    - Added support for sub-query in tables/view fields operations in DB::Object::Fields::Field
    - Added support for disabling and enabling triggers in DB::Object::Postgres::Table
    - Added support for temporarily disabling and enabling triggers on an existing query in DB::Object::Postgres::Statement
    - Added method promise in DB::Object::Statement to perform asynchronous query and returning a promise (Promise::Me) object
    - Added method types_const() in DB::Object::Tables, which is a column name to hash of data type constant and name properties created by DB::Object::Tables->structure. This is then shared with the DB::Object::Fields::Field object and enables better placeholder management
    - Added method constant in DB::Object::Fields::Field which returns an hash object with the following properties: constant (integer), name (string), and type (string)

v0.9.15 2021-08-20T02:40:51Z +0900
    - Moved on_conflict from DB::Object to DB::Object::Tables, and DB::Object::Postgres to DB::Object::Postgres::Table and DB::Object::SQLite to DB::Object::SQLite::Tables where it belongs
    - Moved alias as_string avoid insert limit local order replace reset returning reverse select sort tie unix_timestamp update where to DB::Object::Query
    - Updated the pod documentation with links for all of the above
    - Corrected a small bug in DB::Object::Postgres::Tables->on_conflict whereby an error was assumed when the turn value from DB::Object::Postgres::Query->on_conflict was false, but the latter returned a legitimate empty string that was mis-construed as an error
    - In DB::Object->table, which is used to instantiate DB::Object::Tables object, since it uses a cache to increase speed, here if a cached table object, it is cloned before it is returned to avoid undesirable effect like some table alias previously set and disturbing potential new queries.
    - Added some typical typo-catching warnings in where clause in DB::Object::Query->_where_having when a field object (DB::Object::Fields::Field) is provided without assignment.
    - Added coding typo catching in DB::Object::Tables::AUTOLOAD for when the user called a table field on a table object instead of using the table fields object method 'fields_object'
    - Corrected bug where chained method like select->join lead to loss of properties which disrupted the join condition

v0.9.14 2021-08-17T06:39:36Z +0900
    - Added use warnings to all modules

v0.9.13 2021-08-12T19:44:26Z +0900
