NAME

    Device::Chip::MAX44009 - chip driver for MAX44009

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::MAX44009;
       use Future::AsyncAwait;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::MAX44009->new;
       await $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new );
    
       await $chip->power(1);
    
       sleep 1; # Wait for one integration cycle
    
       printf "Current ambient light level is %.2f lux\n",
          scalar await $chip->read_lux;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a Maxim
    Integrated MAX44009 ambient light sensor attached to a computer via an
    I²C adapter.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

 read_config

       $config = await $chip->read_config

    Returns a HASH reference containing the chip config, using fields named
    from the data sheet.

       CONT   => bool
       MANUAL => bool
       CDR    => bool
       TIM    => 800 | 400 | 200 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 12.5 | 6.25

 change_config

       await $chip->change_config( %changes )

    Writes updates to the configuration registers.

    Note that these two methods use a cache of configuration bytes to make
    subsequent modifications more efficient.

 read_lux

       $lux = await $chip->read_lux

    Reads the latest light level conversion value and returns the value in
    Lux.
