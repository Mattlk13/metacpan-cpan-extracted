SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [For::App::shcompgen]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin is meant only for building App-shcompgen distribution (see
    App::shcompgen). Currently what it does:

      * Modify Makefile.PL so Makefile will run shcompgen init & shcompgen
      generate when distribution is installed

      This allows initialization of shcompgen after installation, so it's
      ready for use.
