NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckDeploymentHandlerFiles - Check you've created
    the DH files for this version

SYNOPSIS

        [CheckDeploymentHandlerFiles]

DESCRIPTION

    If you have a schema that uses DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler then your
    deployment will bail if you don't have a directory for migrating to the
    current version. If your schema is part of a wider module it's fairly
    likely that you'll forget to create these files because you didn't do
    any work on the schema.

    This plugin simply bails if there's no x-y directory where DH would
    normally put them.

TODO

    Configuration so that the user can replicate any customisation of
    DeploymentHandler, thus searching for the correct directory.

BUGS

    Report any issues on the github bugtracker.
