Changes for DateTimeX::Immutable

0.36 - Fri Oct 16 10:54:41 EDT 2015
    Wraps methods that return durations object as they mutate their arguments.
    These methods shouldn't throw exceptions, but need special treatment.
    [Recommend all users upgrade]

    Adds Class::Method::Modifiers to the prereqs. I knew Role::Tiny needed
    this to use method modifiers, just forgot to include it. Thanks
