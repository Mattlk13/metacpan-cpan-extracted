NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::cpanm - installs your dist using cpanminus

VERSION
    version 1.0.2

SYNOPSIS
        $ dzil cpanm

DESCRIPTION
    Installs your distribution as if you had typed:

        dzil install --install-command="cpanm ."    # Really no fun at all!

    Options that will be passed to the cpanm script can come in via
    environment (DZ_CPANM_OPTIONS), or your Dist::Zilla configuration
    (~/.dzil/config.ini):

        [%CPANMinus]
        options = --interactive --verbose --sudo

    The environment variable supersedes any setting in the config; that is
    unless it is prefixed with a "+", in which case it will be appended to
    the value pulled from the configuration file.

    Examples

    As simple as it gets:
            $ dzil cpanm

    You may want cpanm to use these options:
            $ export DZ_CPANM_OPTIONS='--verbose --interactive'
            $ dzil cpanm

        These options will override any you have in the configuration file.

    You may just want to add "--sudo" to your "config.ini" options:
            $ DZ_CPANM_OPTIONS='+--sudo' dzil cpanm

        The "--sudo" option is appended to those in the configuration file.
