NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic::Freenode - Tests to check your
    code against policies inspired by #perl on Freenode

VERSION

    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

        [Test::Perl::Critic::Freenode]

DESCRIPTION

    This will provide a xt/author/critic-freenode.t file for use during the
    "test" and "release" calls of dzil. To use this, make the changes to
    dist.ini above and run one of the following:

        dzil test
        dzil release

    During these runs, xt/author/critic-freenode.t will use
    Test::Perl::Critic to run Perl::Critic against your code and report its
    findings.

    This plugin is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles.

    This plugin is a fork of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic.
