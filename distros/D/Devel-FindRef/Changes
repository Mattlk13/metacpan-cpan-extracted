Revision history for Perl extension Devel::FindRef

TODO: unwrap the save stack to find mortalised scalars (too version dependent).
TODO: hash keys containing \x00 do not display properly.
TODO: get the stack of non-running coroutines?

TODO: And, there's one more thing.. The `sub THREE` in t/02_array_hash_weaken.t
TODO: is reported as
TODO:   `CODE(0xb92810) [refcount 1], which is the global &main::THREE`
TODO:  on perl-5.20.3 or earlier versions, and reported as
TODO:   `CODE(0x1517c60) [refcount 1],  which is referenced by REF(0x1518038)
TODO: [refcount 2], which is the hash member 'THREE' of HASH(0x14f2fe0) [refcount
TODO: 2], which is the global %main::main::`
TODO:  on perl-5.22.3 or later versions. It makes me a little unhappy, but it's
TODO: still acceptable to me~

1.45 Fri Jun 23 20:27:07 CEST 2017
	- port to 5.22 and maybe later versions, mostly based on the
          patch by Cindy Wang.
        - added t/02_array_hash_weaken.t test case by Cindy Wang.
        - bumped minimum version to 5.008003.
        - added Canary::Stability, so minimum version doesn't keep it from
          compiling with older versions.

1.44 Tue Jun  3 20:40:13 CEST 2014
	- port to 5.20 (analyzed by Dave Mitchell).

1.43  Fri May 16 09:43:01 CEST 2014
	- port to 5.18.
        - hopefully better treat anon subs that have been un-anonized
          without adjusting the pad by Sub::Name (I forgot who sent
          the testcase).
	- fix ref2ptr/ptr2ref documentation.

1.422 Sun Aug 30 16:33:24 CEST 2009
	- more of the same changes as in 1.422.
        - rely on common::sense.

1.421 Fri Aug 28 22:25:57 CEST 2009
	- tweaked lexical messages a bit (the HASH "is the lexical %var",
          not "is in the lexical %var".

1.42 Wed Jul  1 10:24:42 CEST 2009
	- allow possible anonymous gv's without crashing in 5.10
          (untested).

1.41 Fri Jun 26 16:48:49 CEST 2009
	- special-case immortal values (\undef etc.)
	- fix a bug causing some GV references to be dropped.
        - find and output lvalue target references.
        - escape hash keys on output.
        - avoid a crash when passing in a non-reference.

1.4  Mon Dec  1 14:43:35 CET 2008
	- show refcount for each scalar.
        - indicate that scalars are mortalised (but not where).
        - flatten the results slightly.

1.31 Sun Jul 20 18:38:17 CEST 2008
	- correctly identify the main program and function call
          argument vectors (patch by Paul LeoNerd Evans).
	- use ref2ptr instead of +0 to correctly get the address
          of overloaded variables (reported by Paul LeoNerd Evans).
	- use UV in ptr2ref, as perl seems to do the same internally.

1.3  Sat Jul 12 00:17:03 CEST 2008
	- ignore the new "our" PVMG sv's from perl 5.10.
	- apply a lot of fixes by Chris Heath,
          handling constant functions and WEAKOUTSIDE better.
        - avoid following circular reference chains.
        - add some visual clues to the output string.
        - look into anonymous closures to see where they were cloned.
        - introduce PERL_DEVEL_FINDREF_DEPTH env variable.

1.2  Sat Apr 26 05:14:58 CEST 2008
	- apply lots of fixes by Chris Heath.
        - redo example in manpage, it's complete now.

1.1  Sat Dec 29 22:04:14 CET 2007
	- ignore weak references.
        - weaken internal references, to avoid displaying
          them and drowning important output.
        - properly find magical references.

1.0  Wed Nov 28 13:19:45 CET 2007
	- correctly restore RMAGICAL flag (Ruslan Zakirov).

0.2  Wed Feb  7 22:31:58 CET 2007
	- "backport" to 5.8.8.

0.1  Fri Jan 12 00:06:57 CET 2007
	- initial release.

0.0  Thu Jan 11 14:21:47 CET 2007
	- copied from Convert-Scalar.
