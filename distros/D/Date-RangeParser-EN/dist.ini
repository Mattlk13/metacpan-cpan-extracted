; The tooling isn't currently smart enough to know that from
; 2012 to 2022 this was (C) Michael Aquilina <maquilina () ohpasw ! com>
; and I'm not sure how to fix that now.
;
; So, for now this comment that say MAq was the original author
; and copyright holder for most of the code just lives here.
;
; I did file an internal ticket to look into improving this situation
; when we have time to do so.
