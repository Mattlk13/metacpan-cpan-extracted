SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Rinci::AbstractFromMeta]

    In your module/script:

     # ABSTRACT:

    During build, abstract will be filled with summary from Rinci package
    metadata, or Rinci function metadata (if there are more than one, will
    pick "the largest" function, measured by the dump length).

    If Abstract is already filled, will leave it alone.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin is another DRY module. If you have already put summaries in
    Rinci metadata, why repeat it in the dzil Abstract?
