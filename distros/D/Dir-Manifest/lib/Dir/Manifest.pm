=head1 NAME

Dir::Manifest

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $obj = Dir::Manifest->new(
        {
            manifest_fn => "./t/data/texts/list.txt",
            dir         => "./t/data/texts/texts",
        }
    );

    # TEST
    is (
        scalar(`my-process ...`),
        $obj->text("my-process-output1", {lf => 1,}),
        "Good output of my-process.",
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here is the primary use case: you have several long texts (and/or binary blobs) that you
wish to load from the code (e.g: for the "want"/expected values of tests) and you wish to
conventiently edit them, track them and maintain them. Using L<Dir::Manifest> you can
put each in a separate file in a directory, create a manifest file listing all valid
filenames/key and then say something like
C<<< my $text = $dir->text("deal24solution.txt", {lf => 1}) >>>. And hopefully it will
be done securely and reliably.

=head1 NAME

Dir::Manifest - treat a directory and a manifest file as a hash/dictionary of keys to texts or blobs

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.3

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $self->manifest_fn()

The path to the manifest file.

=head2 $self->dir()

The path to the directory containing the texts and blobs as files.

=head2 $self->get_keys()

Returns a sorted array reference containing the available keys as strings.

=head2 $self->get_obj($key)

Returns the L<Dir::Manifest::Key> object associated with the string $key.
Throws an error if $key was not given in the manifest.

=head2 my $contents = $self->text("$key", {%OPTS})

Slurps the key using L<Dir::Manifest::Slurp>

=head2 my $hash_ref = $obj->texts_dictionary( {slurp_opts => {},} );

Returns a hash reference (a dictionary) containing all keys and their slurped contents
as values. C<'slurp_opts'> is passed to text().
