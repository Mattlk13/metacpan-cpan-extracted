=head1 NAME

Dir::Manifest::Key

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here is the primary use case: you have several long texts (and/or binary blobs) that you
wish to load from the code (e.g: for the "want"/expected values of tests) and you wish to
conventiently edit them, track them and maintain them. Using L<Dir::Manifest> you can
put each in a separate file in a directory, create a manifest file listing all valid
filenames/key and then say something like
C<<< my $text = $dir->text("deal24solution.txt", {lf => 1}) >>>. And hopefully it will
be done securely and reliably.
