NAME
    Data::Section::Seekable - Read and write parts from data section

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.092 of Data::Section::Seekable (from
    Perl distribution Data-Section-Seekable), released on 2023-03-24.

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines a simple format to let you store and read parts from
    data section. The distribution also comes with a reader (see
    Data::Section::Seekable::Reader) and a writer/generator (see
    Data::Section::Seekable::Writer).

    Like Data::Section, the format allows you to store multiple parts in
    data section. This module's format is different from Data::Section's and
    is meant to allow seeking to any random content part just by reading the
    index/"table of content" part of the data section.

FORMAT
    This document descries version 1 (v1) of the format.

    First line of data section is the header line and must be:

     Data::Section::Seekable v1

    Actually, the header line needs not be the first line of data. Previous
    lines not matching the header line will be ignored (so you can put other
    stuffs here).

    After the header line, comes zero or more TOC ("table of content")
    lines. Each TOC line must match this Perl regex:

     /^([^,]+), (\d+), (\d+) (?:, (.*))?/x

    The first field is the name, the second field is the offset, the third
    field is the length. Offset starts from 0 and the zero is counted from
    after the blank line after the last TOC line. The fourth field is to
    store extra information, it is optional and can contain zero or more
    non-newline characters.

    After the last TOC line is a blank line. And after that is content.

    Example:

     Data::Section::Seekable v1
     part1,0,14
     part2,14,17,very,important

     This is part1
     This is part
     two

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
