SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

     [GenShellCompletion]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin modifies Makefile.PL so that when a user installs your
    distribution with make install, shcompgen is invoked to generate shell
    completion scripts for your scripts. This is convenient because
    immediately after the user installs your distribution, shell tab
    completion is already activated for your scripts.

    shcompgen recognizes several ways/hints to generate completion to your
    scripts. Please see its documentation for more details.

    Some notes:

    First, user must already install and setup shcompgen prior to
    installing your distribution. But if shcompgen is installed after your
    distribution is installed, she can simply run shcompgen generate to
    scan PATH and generate completion for all recognized programs,
    including yours.

    Second, this plugin's implementation strategy is currently as follow
    (probably hackish): insert some code in the generated Makefile.PL after
    WriteMakefile() to insert some targets in the Makefile generated by
    Makefile.PL.

    Third, currently only MakeMaker is supported, Module::Build is not.

SEE ALSO

    shcompgen

    CLI scripts using the Perinci::CmdLine framework will automatically
    have shell tab completion capability. shcompgen detects this.

    You can also use Getopt::Long::Complete or Getopt::Long::Subcommand.
    shcompgen also detects this.
