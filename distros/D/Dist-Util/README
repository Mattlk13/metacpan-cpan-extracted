NAME
    Dist::Util - Dist-related utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.071 of Dist::Util (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Util), released on 2022-08-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use Dist::Util qw(
         list_dist_modules
         list_dists
         packlist_for
     );

     say packlist_for("Text::ANSITable"); # sample output: /home/steven/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/lib/site_perl/5.18.2/x86_64-linux/auto/Text/ANSITable/.packlist
     my @mods = list_dist_modules("Text::ANSITable"); # -> ("Text::ANSITable", "Text::ANSITable::BorderStyle::Default", "Text::ANSITable::ColorTheme::Default")

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  packlist_for($mod) => STR
    Find ".packlist" file for installed module $mod (which can be in the
    form of "Package::SubPkg" or "Package/SubPkg.pm"). Return undef if none
    is found.

    Depending on the content of @INC, the returned path may be absolute or
    relative.

    Caveat: many Linux distributions strip ".packlist" files.

  list_dists
    Usage:

     list_dists(%opts) => LIST

    Find all ".packlist" files in @INC and then pick the dist names from the
    paths, because ".packlist" files are put in:

     $INC/$Config{archname}/auto/Foo/Bar/.packlist

    Caveat: many Linux distributions strip ".packlist" files.

    TODO: Instead of via .packlist, also try querying the OS package
    manager.

    Known options:

    *   detail

        Bool. If set to true, instead of a list of distribution names, the
        function will return a list of hashrefs containing detailed
        information e.g.:

         (
           {dist=>"Foo-Bar", packlist=>"/home/u1/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.34.0/lib/site_perl/5.34.0/x86_64-linux/auto/Foo/Bar/.packlist"},
           ...
         )

  list_dist_modules($mod) => LIST
    Given installed module name $mod (which must be the name of the main
    module of its distribution), list all the modules in the distribution.
    This is done by first finding the ".packlist" file, then look at all the
    ".pm" files listed in the packlist.

    Will return empty list if fails to get the packlist.

    Caveat: many Linux distributions strip ".packlist" files.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
