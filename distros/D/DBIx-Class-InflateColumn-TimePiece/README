NAME

    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::TimePiece - Auto-create Time::Piece objects
    from integer (number of seconds since epoch) columns

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

        package Event;
    
        use base 'DBIx::Class::Core';
    
        __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::TimePiece/);
        __PACKAGE__->table('my_events');
        __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
            event_name => {
                data_type => 'varchar',
                size      => 45,
            },
            event_created => {
                data_type          => 'integer',
                inflate_time_piece => 1,
            },
        );
    
        1;

    In the above example, a DBIx::Class named Event is created, then this
    DBIx::Class Component is loaded and two columns are added to the
    my_events table.

    A column with data_type equal to integer or int and with property
    inflate_time_piece set to true, will be inflated using localtime in
    Time::Piece and deflated using the epoch method.
