Create "shortcut" keys to set render_args in field definitions:

has_field 'foo' => ( 'ra.element_attr.class' => [ 'mb10', 'cs33' ] }
has_field 'foo' => ( 'ra.ea.class' => [ 'mb10', 'cs33' ] }

render_args = 'ra'
element_attr = 'ea'
label_attr = 'la'
wrapper_attr = 'wa' ... which wrapper?

Wrapping.

What's the difference between a layout and a wrapper...
ok, a layout has the order of things and intermediate stuff like the bootstrap controls
a wrapper just wraps other content

a wrapper just wraps, usually with a div, but could be a fieldset or something

Do we want element wrappers? um... what other kind of wrappers?

tomboh: the code base I'm currently working on uses lots of "wrapper_class" and "wrapper_tag" and some "element_class" and "element_attr"

ra.wa.class  ra.wa.tag  ra.ea.class  ra.ea.<whatever>


There's a problem with the whole Repeatable 'contains' thing. It behaves very strangely. Maybe discourage or remove it in favor of the List field?
Anyway, if it stays, should fix the id on the repeatable instance container, and don't use the stupid 0 label, so render without a label for
the elements of the array, and *with* a label for the "field".
