Form
----------------
'posted' flag renamed to 'submitted'
instead of html_prefix => 1, field_prefix => 'prefix-string'

No 'result' objects. No 'run' method (as an alternative to 'process');

->process is automatically run at the end of BUILD, so it's not necessary to
   run ->process( params => {} ) immediately after constructing an object.

Some differences in what is returned for $form->value at intermediate
processing points (not validated, etc, because of result
object removal. The final value hashref after successfully processing
is the same.

Renamed initialization methods:
   _result_from_object => 'fill_from_object'
   _result_from_input => 'fill_from_params'
   _result_from_fields  => 'fill_from_fields'

A number of attributes that used to return arrays from methods, now
return arrayrefs by default. There is usally also an 'all_' method
which will return an array.
    'errors' 'error_fields'

Change in 'required' behavior for Compound/Repeatable fields..?

Setting value/input - _set_value => value,  _set_input => input

No 'has_many' support for Select field


Fields
-----------------
no 'unique_message'   =>    $messages->{ unique => '...' }
no 'required_message'  =>   $messages->{ required => '...' }
no 'widget' attribute

no html5 attributes.

Fields not provided
-------------------
Duration

processing hooks
-----------------

in middle of setup method (formerly setup_form) -  'in_setup'
   (used to be a modifier of 'set_active')
