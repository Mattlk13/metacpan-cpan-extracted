Text::MicroTemplate  Kazuho Oku  last updated June 2015
   part of the inspiration for Xslate. Based on Mojo::Template
   Uses embedded Perl. Marked with <?  ?> or a single question mark at the beginning of a line
   Also - Text::MicroTemplate::Extended
          Text::MicroTemplate::DataSection

my Template::Snippets (template-minimal)
   borrowed from Template::Teeny (konobi)


Text::Template  -  mjd. 13 likes.
   written originally back in 2003? uses all upper case for options like HASH => { }
   kinda strange functionality, but workable. Variables come from package or our variables or
      can be passed in with HASH =>. 
   MicroTemplate seems simpler

   Documentaiton sucks. Couldn't find anything on actually creating a template.
