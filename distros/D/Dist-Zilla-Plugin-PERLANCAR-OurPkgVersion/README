SYNOPSIS

    in dist.ini

            [PERLANCAR::OurPkgVersion]

    in your modules

            # VERSION

    or

            our $VERSION = '0.123'; # VERSION

DESCRIPTION

    This module is like Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion but can replace
    the previously generated our $VERSION = '0.123';  bit. If the author of
    OurPkgVersion thinks this is a good idea, then perhaps this module will
    be merged with OurPkgVersion.

    Comment/directive below __DATA__ or __END__ will not be replaced.
