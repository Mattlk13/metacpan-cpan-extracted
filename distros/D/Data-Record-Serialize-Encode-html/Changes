  [BUG FIX]

    * bump required version of Perl to 5.12 in order to track what
      Data::Record::Serialize uses

    * remove use of postfix deref operator, as that's too advanced for
      the minimum Perl required (5.12)


0.01      2024-01-10 12:30:10-05:00 America/New_York

* First release upon an unsuspecting world.
