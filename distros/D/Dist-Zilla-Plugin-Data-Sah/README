VERSION

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Data::Sah]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is to be used when building "Data-Sah" distribution (see
    Data::Sah) and "Data-Sah-*" distribution like "Data-Sah-Compiler-*"
    distributions. Currently it does the following:

    *   For "lib/Data/Sah/Type/*.pm", check that schema specified in each
        clause's "schema" is normalized

    *   TODO: For "lib/Data/Sah/Type/*.pm", check that schema specified in
        each clause attribute's "schema" is normalized

    Note that for "Data-Sah-Coerce-*" distributions there are
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Data::Sah::Coerce. For "Data-Sah-Filter-*"
    distributions there are Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Data::Sah::Filter.
