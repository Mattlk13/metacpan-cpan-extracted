NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Alt - Create Alt distributions with Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS

    Your dist.ini:

     [GatherDir]
     [MakeMaker]
     [Alt]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin can be added to an existing dist.ini file to
    turn your (or someone else's distribution into an Alt distribution).
    What it does is:

    Modifies Makefile.PL or Build.PL

      Adds code to change the install location so that your dist won't be
      installed unless the environment variable PERL_ALT_INSTALL is set.

    Updates the no_index meta

      So that only .pm files in your lib directory that are in the Alt::
      namespace will be indexed.

    Sets the dist name property

      If it isn't already specified in your dist.ini file. It will
      determine this from the Alt:: module in your distribution. If you
      have more than one Alt:: module it is an error.

CAVEATS

    This plugin should appear in your dist.ini toward the end, or at least
    after your [GatherDir] and [MakeMaker] plugins (or equivalent).
