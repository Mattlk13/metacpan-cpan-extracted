=head1 NAME

ebug_client - Debugger client for remote debugging Perl script

=head1 VERSION

version 0.64

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ebug_client -key <secret> -port <port>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<ebug_client> is an debugger front end for attaching to
remotely executing perl script, running on L<ebug_server>.

To invoke L<ebug_client>, you must first invoke L<ebug_server> to
run debuggee and generate "key" and "port" needed for connection.
When L<ebug_server> is invoked, it will show exact command-line to
invoke L<ebug_client>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 # Attach to ebug_server running on port 4023, with key "begripra"
 $ ebug_client -key begripra -port 4023

=head1 NOTE

Currently, you cannot "restart" debuggee. You'll need to
restart one manually by re-invoking both L<ebug_server> and
L<ebug_client>.

Since Devel::ebug::Backend listens to "localhost" socket,
you will need to relay I/O using tool like socat for true
remote debugging.

Internally, thanks for it being free software, it is almost
a complete ripoff of Devel::ebug source.
