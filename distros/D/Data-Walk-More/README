NAME
    Data::Walk::More - Traverse Perl data structures, with more information
    during traversing

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Data::Walk::More (from Perl
    distribution Data-Walk-More), released on 2022-07-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Walk::More; # exports walk() and walkdepth()

     walk \&wanted, @items_to_walk;
     walkdepth \&wanted, @items_to_walk;

     # full options
     walk {
         wanted => \&wanted,
         # follow => 0,         # whether to follow circular refs, default is 0.
         # bydepth => 0,        # whether to descend into subnodes first. default is 0.
         # sortkeys => 1,       # whether to visit hash values in key order. default is 1.
         # recurseobjects => 1, # whether to recurse into objects. default is 1.
     }, @items_to_walk;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is like Data::Walk, but there are a few differences, a few
    more options, and the callback gets more information.

VARIABLES
    The following variables are available for the callback. Unless specified
    otherwise, do not modify these during traversing.

  $Data::Walk::More::depth
    Integer, starts at 0.

  @Data::Walk::More::containers
  $Data::Walk::More::container
  @Data::Walk::More::indexes
  $Data::Walk::More::index
  $Data::Walk::More::prune
    Can be set to true to prevent Data::Walk::More to descend into hash or
    array. Ineffective when you use "bydepth" option, since Data::Walk::More
    will have already descended into hash or array before the callback can
    prune it.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DATA::WALK::MORE (DWM) WITH DATA::WALK (DW)
    DWM also provides the full path (containers from the top level, in
    @containers and <@indexes>) instead of just the immediate container in
    $container and $index.

    When traversing hash, $index package variable in DWM refers to hash key,
    not a number, which is more useful in my opinion.

    You can prune (avoid descending) by setting $prune.

FUNCTIONS
  walk
    Options:

   wanted
   bydepth
   follow
   sortkeys
   recurseobjects
  walkdepth

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
