DESCRIPTION

    This is ASDAGO's plugin bundle for Dist::Zilla.

ATTRIBUTES

 sysname

    This is the system name used for the git repository on Savannah
    <https://savannah.nongnu.org>. It defaults to the distribution
    name. You can use formatting codes as for
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResourcesFromGit.

 fast_build

    If this is true, then some things will be skipped in order to
    generate the build faster. Do not use this in releases. The
    environment variable FAST_BUILD can also be used to set this
    attribute.

    Things that are skipped are things that should be present in
    releases, but are not necessary for testing and may slow down the
    build significantly. For example, auto-generated prerequisites.

 fake_release

    If this is true, then use the FakeRelease plugin instead of
    UploadToCPAN. The environment variable FAKE_RELEASE can also be
    used to set this attribute.

 skip_push

    If this is true, then pushing to the git repository will be
    skipped during release. The environment variable SKIP_PUSH can
    also be used to set this attribute.
