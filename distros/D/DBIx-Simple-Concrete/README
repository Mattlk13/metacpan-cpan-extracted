DBIx::Simple::Concrete

The recommended way to use SQL::Concrete is via its DBIx::Simple
integration, which provides an excellent alternative to plain DBI
access.

But by loading this module instead (or after) DBIx::Simple, a "cquery"
method will be added to it which integrates SQL::Concrete just the same
way as its built-in "iquery" method integrates SQL::Interp.

This is all there is to this module.
