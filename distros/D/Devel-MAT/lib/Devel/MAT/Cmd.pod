=head1 NAME

C<Devel::MAT::Cmd> - abstractions for providing commands for C<Devel::MAT>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 printf

  Devel::MAT::Cmd->printf( $fmt, @args )

Behaves like perl's core C<printf()> function.

=head2 print_note

  Devel::MAT::Cmd->print_note( $str, $idx )

A simple C<print>-like function, which may style its output in some way.

Starting from zero, successively higher integer values for C<$idx> may influence
the style further. Output with the same index value will appear the same. The
implementation should support at least 3 different styles, but may wrap after
this.

=head2 print_sv

  Devel::MAT::Cmd->print_sv( $sv )

Prints the address and description of the given SV. This may be stylised in
some way, subject to user customisation, or made possibly interactive if the
UI allows for it to be so.

Returns the length in characters of the string it printed, in case the calling
tool wishes to arrange them in a table.
