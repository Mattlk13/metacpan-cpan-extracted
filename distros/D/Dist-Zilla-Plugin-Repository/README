SYNOPSIS

        # dist.ini
        [Repository]

DESCRIPTION

    The code is mostly a copy-paste of Module::Install::Repository

 ATTRIBUTES

      * git_remote

      This is the name of the remote to use for the public repository (if
      you use Git). By default, unsurprisingly, to origin.

      * github_http

      This attribute is deprecated. If the remote is a GitHub repository,
      list only the https url
      (https://github.com/fayland/dist-zilla-plugin-repository) and not the
      actual clonable url
      (git://github.com/fayland/dist-zilla-plugin-repository.git). This
      used to default to true, but as of 0.16 it defaults to false.

      The CPAN Meta 2 spec defines separate keys for the clonable url and
      web front-end web. The Meta 1 specs allowed only 1 URL. If you set
      github_http to true, the url key will be removed from the v2
      metadata, and the v1 metadata will then use the web key.

      Instead of setting github_http, you should use the MetaJSON plugin to
      include a v2 META.json file with both URLs.

      * repository

      You can set this attribute if you want a specific repository instead
      of the plugin to auto-identify your repository.

      An example would be if you're releasing a module from your fork, and
      you don't want it to identify your fork, so you can specify the
      repository explicitly.

      In the Meta 2 spec, this is the url key.

      * type

      This should be the (lower-case) name of the most common program used
      to work with the repository, e.g. git, svn, cvs, darcs, bzr or hg.
      It's normally determined automatically, but you can override it.

      * web

      This is a URL pointing to a human-usable web front-end for the
      repository.
