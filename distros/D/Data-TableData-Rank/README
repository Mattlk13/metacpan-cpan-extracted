NAME
    Data::TableData::Rank - Add a rank column to a table

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Data::TableData::Rank (from
    Perl distribution Data-TableData-Rank), released on 2021-11-17.

FUNCTIONS
  add_rank_column_to_table
    Usage:

     add_rank_column_to_table(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Add a rank column to a table.

    Will modify the table by adding a rank column. An example, with this
    table:

     | name       | gold | silver | bronze |
     |------------+------+--------+--------|
     | E          |  2   |  5     |  7     |
     | A          | 10   | 20     | 15     |
     | H          |  0   |  0     |  1     |
     | B          |  8   | 23     | 17     |
     | G          |  0   |  0     |  1     |
     | J          |  0   |  0     |  0     |
     | C          |  4   | 10     |  8     |
     | D          |  4   |  9     | 13     |
     | I          |  0   |  0     |  1     |
     | F          |  2   |  5     |  1     |

    the result of ranking the table with data columns of
    "["gold","silver","bronze"]" will be:

     | name       | gold | silver | bronze | rank |
     |------------+------+--------+--------+------|
     | A          | 10   | 20     | 15     |  1   |
     | B          |  8   | 23     | 17     |  2   |
     | C          |  4   | 10     |  8     |  3   |
     | D          |  4   |  9     | 13     |  4   |
     | E          |  2   |  5     |  7     |  5   |
     | F          |  2   |  5     |  1     |  6   |
     | G          |  0   |  0     |  1     | =7   |
     | H          |  0   |  0     |  1     | =7   |
     | I          |  0   |  0     |  1     | =7   |
     | J          |  0   |  0     |  0     | 10   |

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   add_equal_prefix => *bool* (default: 1)

    *   data_columns* => *array[str]*

        Array of names (or indices) of columns which contain the data to be
        compared, which must all be numeric.

    *   rank_column_idx => *int*

    *   rank_column_name => *str* (default: "rank")

    *   smaller_wins => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether a smaller number in the data wins; normally a bigger name
        means a higher rank.

    *   table* => *any*

        A table data (either aoaos, aohos, or its Data::TableData::Object
        wrapper).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
