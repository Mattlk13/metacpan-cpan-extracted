NAME
    Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::replace_dashes_with_underscores - Replace
    dashes in string with underscores

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::replace_dashes_with_underscores (from Perl
    distribution Data-Sah-Filter-perl-Str-replace_dashes_with_underscores),
    released on 2022-07-17.

SYNOPSIS
  Using in Sah schema's "prefilters" (or "postfilters") clause
     ["str","prefilters",[["Str::replace_dashes_with_underscores"]]]

  Using with Data::Sah:
     use Data::Sah qw(gen_validator);
 
     my $schema = ["str","prefilters",[["Str::replace_dashes_with_underscores"]]];
     my $validator = gen_validator($schema);
     if ($validator->($some_data)) { print 'Valid!' }

  Using with Data::Sah:Filter directly:
     use Data::Sah::Filter qw(gen_filter);

     my $filter = gen_filter([["Str::replace_dashes_with_underscores"]]);
     my $filtered_value = $filter->($some_data);

  Sample data and filtering results
     "foo" # valid, unchanged
     "foo-bar" # valid, becomes "foo_bar"

DESCRIPTION
    Can be useful in schemas like Perl module name (or any other identifier
    kind of schema which only allowes alphanumeric characters which include
    underscore but not dash) where you can type dasah (which does not
    require pressing the Shiff key in most keyboards) and later have the
    dash canonicalized to undersore.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
