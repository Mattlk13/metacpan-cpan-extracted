Release history for perl-Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MetaResources-Template.

v0.4.7 @ 2015-11-05 20:49 UTC

    -   License resource in `Dist::Zilla::MetaResources` 4.300039 converted from `Str` to
        `ArrayRef[Str]`. Attempt to tune test behavior to work with both variants failed: old
        (pre-4.300039) `Dist::Zilla` with modern `CPAN::Meta` causes error:

            [MetaYAML] Invalid META structure. Errors found:
            [MetaYAML] Expected a list structure (license) [Validation: 2]

        I see no point in complicating the test, so let me just require appropriate `Dist::Zilla`
        version.

v0.4.6 @ 2015-11-02 22:24 UTC

    -   One test fails with old `Dist::Zilla` because `license` resource is a string, not an array
        as expected by the test. The test skipped if `Dist::Zilla` is too old for the test.

v0.4.5 @ 2015-10-31 22:53 UTC

    -   Dependency on internal module does not work well: `cpanm` successfully installs
        `ErrorLogger` (in spite of the fact it is already installed), then fails because
        `ErrorLogger::Exception::Abort` is not installed. Problem fixed by requiring `ErrorLogger`
        v0.9.0, not `ErrorLogger::Exception::Abort`.

v0.4.4 @ 2015-10-30 22:07 UTC

    [Tests]

    -   Test updated to work with ErrorLogger v0.9.0.

    -   Helper test module eliminated by inlining into the test.

v0.4.3 @ 2015-10-22 14:22 UTC

    [Documentation]

    -   Two real site names replaced with `example.org`.

    -   Short version of license note used in POD.

    [Internals]

    -   Distribution rebuilt with the latest `@Author::VDB` plugin bundle. It includes few more
        tests.

    -   `aspell.en.pws` file renamed to `aspell-en.pws` to make `Test::Portability` happy.

    [Tests]

    -   Code formatting changed a bit to use less parentheses.

    -   `# REQUIRE:` hint used instead of direct `use`.

v0.4.2 @ 2015-09-24 20:42 UTC

    -   The test fails with Perl 5.8.9:

            Dist::Zilla::Role::TextTemplater version 0.004 required--this is only version v0.8.1

        `use version 0.77` added. Required version changed from `0.004` to `'v0.4.0'`. Probably it
        will help.

v0.4.1 @ 2015-09-20 21:38 UTC

    -   One test failed with `Dist::Zilla` 5.020 because it does not allow existing but empty
        `homepage` meta resource. The test fixed.

v0.4.0 @ 2015-09-18 21:14 UTC

    -   Error message now includes problem resource name. However, there is a minor drawback:
        resources are always fit one line, so error messages (designed for general multi-line case)
        look a bit redundant. Also, `license` resource internally is represented as array, it
        affects error message too.

    -   Few tests added.

    -   `ReadMe.pod` dropped.

    -   `TextTemplater` v0.8.0 changed error messages. This change affected
        `MetaResources-Template` tests. Tests were updated to work with `TextTemplater` v0.8.0, but
        `TextTemplater` v0.8.0 is required to run tests, because older `TextTemplater` causes test
        failure. `MetaResources-Template` itself does *not* require `TextTemplater` 0.004, but due
        to bug in `AutoPrereqs` (it blames long-standing bug in `CPAN`, see
        <https://github.com/rjbs/Dist-Zilla/issues/492>) distribution meta information says
        `TextTemplater` v0.8.0 is a runtime requirement.

    -   Version switched from old decimal style to new dotted-decimal style.

0.003 @ 2015-07-22 13:18 UTC

    -   Bug found: `MetaResources::BUILDARGS` treats all the arguments as meta resources. So
        neither `delimiters`, nor `package` nor `prepend` argument has desired effect. Instead,
        they are treated as (invalid) meta resources. Problem fixed by adding own `BUILDARGS` which
        hides `TextTemplate` arguments from parent `BUILDARGS`. But fix requires `TextTemplater`
        v0.003.

0.002 @ 2015-07-15 10:42 UTC

    -   `TextTemplater` role used for better error reporting.

    -   Example added to distribution.

    -   Test fails on systems with `Dist::Zilla` older than v5.300039, because in older versions
        the license resource was a `Str` (now `ArrayRef[Str]`). Test fixed to work with both
        representations.

0.001 @ 2015-07-09 18:08 UTC

    -   Initial release. Functionality is implemented; test is written; doc is in place.
