NAME
    DBIx::TextTableAny - Generate text table from SQL query result using
    Text::Table::Any

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of DBIx::TextTableAny (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-TextTableAny), released on 2018-07-01.

SYNOPSIS
     use DBI;
     use DBIx::TextTableAny;
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", "someuser", "somepass");

    Selecting a row:

     print $dbh->selectrow_texttable("SELECT * FROM member");

    Sample result (default backend is Text::Table::Tiny):

     +-------+----------+----------+
     | Name  | Rank     | Serial   |
     +-------+----------+----------+
     | alice | pvt      | 123456   |
     +-------+----------+----------+

    Selecting all rows:

     print $dbh->selectrow_texttable("SELECT * FROM member");

    Sample result:

     +-------+----------+----------+
     | Name  | Rank     | Serial   |
     +-------+----------+----------+
     | alice | pvt      | 123456   |
     | bob   | cpl      | 98765321 |
     | carol | brig gen | 8745     |
     +-------+----------+----------+

    Picking another backend (and setting other options):

     use DBIx::TextTableAny backend => 'Text::Table::CSV', header_row => 0;

     my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM member");
     $sth->execute;

     print $sth->fetchall_texttable;

    Sample result (note that we instructed the header row to be omitted):

     "alice","pvt","123456"
     "bob","cpl","98765321"
     "carol,"brig gen","8745"

    If you want to change backend/options for subsequent tables, you can do
    this:

     DBIx::TextTableAny->import(backend => 'Text::Table::TSV', header_row => 0);
     print $dbh->selectrow_texttable("more query ...");

    or:

     $DBIx::TextTableAny::opts{header_row} = 0; # you can just change one option
     print $dbh->selectrow_texttable("more query ...");

DESCRIPTION
    This package is a thin glue between Text::Table::Any and DBI. It adds
    the following methods to database handle:

     selectrow_texttable
     selectall_texttable

    as well as the following methods to statement handle:

     fetchrow_texttable
     fetchall_texttable

    The methods send the result of query to Text::Table::Any and return the
    rendered table.

    In essence, this is an easy, straightforward way produce text tables
    from SQL query. You can generate CSV, ASCII table, or whatever format
    the Text::Table::Tiny backend happens to support.
