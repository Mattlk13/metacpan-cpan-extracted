NAME
    DBIx::CSV - Generate CSV from SQL query result

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of DBIx::CSV (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-CSV), released on 2018-12-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use DBI;
     use DBIx::CSV;
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", "someuser", "somepass");

    Generating a row of CSV (with header):

     print $dbh->selectrow_csv("SELECT * FROM member");

    Sample result:

     "Name","Rank","Serial"
     "alice","pvt","123456"

    Generating a row of CSV (without header):

     print $dbh->selectrow_csv_noheader("SELECT * FROM member");

    Sample result:

     "alice","pvt","123456"

    Generating all rows (with header):

     print $dbh->selectall_csv("SELECT * FROM member");

    Sample result:

     "Name","Rank","Serial"
     "alice","pvt","123456"
     "bob","cpl","98765321"
     "carol","brig gen","8745"

    Generating all rows (without header):

     print $dbh->selectall_csv_noheader("SELECT * FROM member");

    Statement handle versions:

     print $sth->fetchrow_csv;
     print $sth->fetchrow_csv_noheader;
     print $sth->fetchall_csv;
     print $sth->fetchall_csv_noheader;

DESCRIPTION
    This package is a thin glue between DBI and DBIx::TextTableAny (which in
    turn is a thin glue to Text::Table::Any). It adds the following methods
    to database handle:

     selectrow_csv
     selectall_csv
     selectrow_csv_noheader
     selectall_csv_noheader

    as well as the following methods to statement handle:

     fetchrow_csv
     fetchall_csv
     fetchrow_csv_noheader
     fetchall_csv_noheader

    The methods send the result of query to Text::Table::Any (using the
    Text::Table::CSV backend) and return the rendered CSV data.

    In essence, this is an easy, straightforward way produce CSV data from
    SQL query.
