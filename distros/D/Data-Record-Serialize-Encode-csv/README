Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::csv

Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::csv encodes a record as CSV (well
anything that Text::CSV can write).

It performs the Data::Record::Serialize::Role::Encode role. If the data
sink is a stream, try Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::csv_stream; it
provides better performance using Text::CSV's native output to
filehandles.
