NAME
    Data::Transmute::Rules::TreeNodeHash::StringifyParent - Stringify parent
    attributes in tree nodes to make the tree more dump-friendly

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Data::Transmute::Rules::TreeNodeHash::StringifyParent (from Perl
    distribution Data-Transmute-Rules-TreeNodeHash-StringifyParent),
    released on 2020-02-13.

DESCRIPTION
    Tree is an interlinked data structure, where a child node links back to
    its parent (and the parent links back to *its* parent, and so on). This
    makes the dump of a tree structure looks unwieldy; if you dump a node,
    you will end up dumping the whole tree.

    This rule walks the tree structure and replaces the value of hash key
    'parent' to its stringified value. This will prevent "dumping upwards"
    and make the structure more dump-friendly.
