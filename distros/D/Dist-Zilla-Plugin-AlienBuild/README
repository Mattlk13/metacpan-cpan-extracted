NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AlienBuild - Use Alien::Build with Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    version 0.33

SYNOPSIS

     [AlienBuild]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin is designed to help create Alien modules using
    the alienfile and Alien::Build recipe system with Alien::Base. The
    intent is that you will maintain your alienfile as you normally would,
    and this plugin will ensure the right prereqs are specified in the
    META.json and other things that are easy to get not quite right.

    Specifically, this plugin:

    adds prereqs

      Adds the configure requirements to your dist configure requires. It
      adds the any requirements from your alienfile to your dist build
      requires.

    adjusts Makefile.PL

      Adjusts your Makefile.PL to use Alien::Build::MM. If you are using
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

    sets the mb_class for Build.PL

      sets mb_class to Alien::Build::MB on the
      Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild plugin. If you are using
      Module::Build.

    turn on dynamic prereqs

      Which are used by most Alien::Build based Alien distributions.

    sets x_alienfile meta

      Unless you turn this feature off using alienfile_meta below.

PROPERTIES

 alienfile_meta

    As of version 0.23, this plugin adds a special x_alienfile metadata to
    your META.json or META.yml. This contains the share and system prereqs
    based on your alienfile. This may be useful for one day searching for
    Aliens which use another specific Alien during their build. Note that
    by their nature, share and system prereqs are dynamic, so on some
    platforms they may actually be different.

    This is on by default. You can turn this off by setting this property
    to 0.

 clean_install

    Sets the clean_install property on Alien::Build::MM.

 eumm_hash_var

    Sets the variable name that is used in the Makefile.PL for its
    arguments. Defaults to %WriteMakefileArgs, and is required to begin
    with % or $. This is useful when defining your own Makefile template
    with Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Custom.

NOTES

    When defining your own Makefile.PL template (to use with
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Custom, for example,) you can specify
    where you want this module to insert its code by having this line in
    the template:

      # ALIEN BUILD MM

    An example template to use would be this:

      use ExtUtils::MakeMaker ##{ $eumm_version ##};
      
      my %args = (
        NAME => "My::Alien::Module",
      ##{ $plugin->get_default(qw(ABSTRACT AUTHOR LICENSE VERSION)) ##}
      ##{ $plugin->get_prereqs(1) ##}
      );
      
      # ALIEN BUILD MM
      
      WriteMakefile(%args);

    and a dist.ini using this template would include this:

      [MakeMaker::Custom]
      # We need to manipulate %args on-the-fly if we set the version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker any lower.
      eumm_version: 6.64
    
      [AlienBuild]
      eumm_hash_var: %args
