NAME
    Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible - Dump Perl data structures as HTML
    document with collapsible sections

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible
    (from Perl distribution Data-Dump-HTML-Collapsible), released on
    2024-03-12.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible; # exports dd(), can export dump()
     dd [1, 2, 3];

DESCRIPTION
    This module dumps Perl data structure to HTML document where you can
    expand and collapse nodes to drill down and roll up your data. It
    currently uses the "<summary>" and "<details>" HTML elements.

VARIABLES
  $Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible::OPT_PERL_VERSION
    String, default: 5.010.

    Set target Perl version. If you set this to, say 5.010, then the dumped
    code will keep compatibility with Perl 5.10.0. This is used in the
    following ways:

    *   passed to Regexp::Stringify

    *   when dumping code references

        For example, in perls earlier than 5.016, feature.pm does not
        understand:

         no feature ':all';

        so we replace it with:

         no feature;

  $Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible::OPT_REMOVE_PRAGMAS
    Bool, default: 0.

    If set to 1, then pragmas at the start of coderef dump will be removed.
    Coderef dump is produced by B::Deparse and is of the form like:

     sub { use feature 'current_sub', 'evalbytes', 'fc', 'say', 'state', 'switch', 'unicode_strings', 'unicode_eval'; $a <=> $b }

    If you want to dump short coderefs, the pragmas might be distracting.
    You can turn turn on this option which will make the above dump become:

     sub { $a <=> $b }

    Note that without the pragmas, the dump might be incorrect.

  $Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible::::OPT_DEPARSE
    Bool, default: 1.

    Can be set to 0 to skip deparsing code. Coderefs will be dumped as
    "sub{"DUMMY"}" instead, like in Data::Dump.

  $Data::Dump::HTML::Collapsible::::OPT_STRINGIFY_NUMBERS
    Bool, default: 0.

    If set to true, will dump numbers as quoted string, e.g. 123 as "123"
    instead of 123. This might be helpful if you want to compute the hash of
    or get a canonical representation of data structure.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
