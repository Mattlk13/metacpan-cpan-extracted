0.004000  Thu Sep 26 09:59:55 2024

    - Entire revamp of module with numerous new features
      For backwards compatible output: use Data::Show with => 'Legacy'
      (Thanks, Mike!)

    - Added 'with' option to install different dumpers

    - Added 'as' option to install show() under a different name

    - Added 'fallback' option to control fallback when a dumper module is unavailable

    - Added 'grid' option to put output in a box

    - Added 'style' and '<specific>style' options to control output styling

    - Added 'warnings' option to enable/disable warnings when dumper is missing

    - Changed default output format to show context better

    - Added coloured output to distinguish dumped output from normal output

    - Redesigned show() so that it can be used "en passant" within an expression
      (with warnings when that would change the behaviour of code due to list context)

    - Added unimport() (i.e. no Data::Show) to facilitate iterative debugging
      by turning off show() lexically, without actually needing to
      remove show() from the source

    - Allowed module to detect and correct for (some) #line directives in main file
