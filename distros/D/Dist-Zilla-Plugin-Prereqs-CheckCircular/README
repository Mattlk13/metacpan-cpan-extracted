SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Prereqs::CheckCircular]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will check that there is no circular dependency being
    formed. This is done by: collecting all RuntimeRequires prereqs of the
    distribution, then feeding them to App::lcpan to get the recursive
    dependencies of those prereqs. If one of those dependencies is one of
    the distribution's modules, then we have a circular dependency and the
    build is aborted.

ENVIRONMENT

 DZIL_CHECKCIRCULAR_SKIP => bool

    Can be set to 1 to skip checking circular dependency.
