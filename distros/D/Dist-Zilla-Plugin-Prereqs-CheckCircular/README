NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::CheckCircular - Check for
    circular/recursive dependencies (using local CPAN mirror)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::CheckCircular (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Prereqs-CheckCircular), released on 2021-05-31.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Prereqs::CheckCircular]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will check that there is no circular dependency being
    formed. This is done by: collecting all RuntimeRequires prereqs of the
    distribution, then feeding them to App::lcpan to get the recursive
    dependencies of those prereqs. If one of those dependencies is one of
    the distribution's modules, then we have a circular dependency and the
    build is aborted.

ENVIRONMENT
  DZIL_CHECKCIRCULAR_SKIP => bool
    Can be set to 1 to skip checking circular dependency.
