SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [SetEnv]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin sets various environment variables so when one of your
    plugins runs another program or script, the program can get various
    information about Dist::Zilla or the building process through the
    environment variables.

    Plugin ordering is important. Generally you should put this SetEnv
    plugin before any other plugin that you might want to run programs
    from, so SetEnv already has the chance to set e.g. DZIL_PHASE.

ENVIRONMENT

 DZIL => bool

    Can be used by programs/scripts to tell that they are running under
    Dist::Zilla.

    This is set to 1 at the "before build" phase.

 DZIL_NAME => set

    Can be used by programs/scripts to tell what distribution is being
    built.

    This is set to $zilla->name at the "before build" phase.

    Example: App-YourApp

 DZIL_PHASE => str

    Can be used by programs/scripts to tell what phase they are in.

    This is set to before_build at the "before build" phase.

    Set to before_mint at the "before mint" phase.

    Set to before_release at the "before release" phase.

    Set to make_module at the "make module" (ModuleMaker) phase.

    Set to gather_files at the "file gathering" phase.

    Set to set_file_encodings at the "set file encodings" phase.

 DZIL_RELEASING => bool

    Included for completeness. This is not set by this plugin, but by
    Dist::Zilla itself at the beginning of the release process.

    Can be used by programs/scripts to tell that they are in a release
    process.

 DZIL_TESTING => bool

    Can be used by programs/scripts to tell that they are in a test
