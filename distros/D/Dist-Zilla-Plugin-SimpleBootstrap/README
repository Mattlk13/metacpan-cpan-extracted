NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SimpleBootstrap - Bootstrap a Dist::Zilla library

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini
      [SimpleBootstrap]

      # use a plugin under lib/
      [Plugin::Under::Development]

DESCRIPTION
    Allow using a plugin being developed in its own "dist.ini". Unlike
    [Bootstrap::lib], it doesn't try to use a version of the module that has
    been built by Dist::Zilla, instead always using modules directly from
    lib/.

    Additionally, it ensures that the modules are available during the build
    phase. Dist::Zilla localizes @INC during the initial loading of modules,
    so modifications made at that time wouldn't normally persist. This
    allows things like Pod::Weaver plugins to be used from the lib/
    directory.

    If a share/ directory exists, it will be set as the share directory for
    the distribution.

OPTIONS
    lib Can be used to specify an alternate directory to bootstrap, rather
        than lib.

    share
        Specifies the dist share directory for the distribution.

        If module_share is not specified, this defaults to share.

        Defaults to share.

    module_share
        Specifies module share directories. Should be formatted as:

          module_share = My::Module = share

KNOWN ISSUES
    *   This module will not work well when used with Test::DZil.

SEE ALSO
    *   [Bootstrap::lib], a significantly more complex plugin, which doesn't
        solve the problem of @INC being localized. Also does not include
        handling for share directories.

    *   [lib], a simple plugin, but which doesn't solve the problem of @INC
        being localized. Also does not include handling for share
        directories.
