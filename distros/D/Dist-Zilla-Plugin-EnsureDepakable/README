SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [EnsureDepakable]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin helps make sure that you do not add a (direct, or indirect)
    dependency to a non-core XS module, so that all your distribution's
    modules can be use-d by a script that wants to be packed so it can be
    run with only requiring core perl modules.

    See Module::Depakable for more details on the meaning of "depakable".

ENVIRONMENT
  DZIL_ENSUREDEPAKABLE_SKIP => bool
    Can be set to 1 to skip checking depakable.
