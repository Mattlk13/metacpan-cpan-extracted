NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyFilesFromBuild::Filtered - Copy files from
    build directory, but filter out lines

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        [CopyFilesFromBuild::Filtered]
        copy = Makefile.PL

        [CopyFilesFromBuild::Filtered]
        copy = whatever.txt
        filter = #.*whatever.*

DESCRIPTION
    This module copies files from the build directory to the source
    directory, but filters out lines from the copied file. It is designed in
    particular for generated *.PL files, which often have unwanted
    "generated by" comments that cause unwanted file churn under source
    control.

ATTRIBUTES
  copy
    Specifies files to be copied from the build directory back to the
    distribution source. May be given multiple times.

  filter
    A regular expression given as string. Any matching lines in copied files
    will be filtered out of the copy. It will be applied as follows:

        s{^$filter\n}{}mg

    Thus, it is anchored at the start of a line to the newline at the end.

    The default matches a comment with "generated by" as found in typical
    generated *.PL files: "#.*generated by.*"
