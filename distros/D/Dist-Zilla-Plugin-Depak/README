SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Depak]
     ;;; the default is to include all scripts, but use below to include only some
     ;;; scripts
     ;include_script=bin/script1
     ;include_script=bin/script2

    In depak.conf in dist top-level directory, put your depak
    configuration.

    During build, your scripts will be replaced with the packed version.

    Also, you should also have a module named Something::Packed (i.e. whose
    name ends in ::Packed), which contains:

     # PACKED_MODULES
     # PACKED_DISTS

    During build, these will be replaced with:

     our %PACKED_MODULES = (...); # PACKED_MODULES
     our @PACKED_DISTS = (...); # PACKED_DISTS

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will replace your scripts with the packed version (that is,
    scripts that have their dependencies packed onto themselves). Packing
    will be done using depak.

    If depak.conf exists in your dist's top-level directory, it will be
    used as the depak configuration.

    In addition to replacing scripts with the packed version, it will also
    search for directives # PACKED_MODULES and # PACKED_DISTS in module
    files and replace them with %PACKED_MODULES and @PACKED_DISTS. The
    %PACKED_MODULES hash lists all the modules that are included in the one
    of the scripts. This can be useful for tools that might need it.
    @PACKED_DISTS array lists all the dists that are included in one of the
    scripts. This also can be useful for tools that might need it, like
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::CheckDepDists.

    There is also # PACKED_CONTENTS_POD which you can put in your script.
    It will be replaced with POD that list the packed modules/dists.
