NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Depak - Pack dependencies onto scripts during build
    using 'depak'

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.21 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Depak (from
    Perl distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Depak), released on 2017-07-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Depak]
     ;;; the default is to include all scripts, but use below to include only some
     ;;; scripts
     ;include_script=bin/script1
     ;include_script=bin/script2

    In "depak.conf" in dist top-level directory, put your depak
    configuration.

    During build, your scripts will be replaced with the packed version.

    Also, you should also have a module named "Something::Packed" (i.e.
    whose name ends in "::Packed"), which contains:

     # PACKED_MODULES
     # PACKED_DISTS

    During build, these will be replaced with:

     our %PACKED_MODULES = (...); # PACKED_MODULES
     our @PACKED_DISTS = (...); # PACKED_DISTS

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will replace your scripts with the packed version (that is,
    scripts that have their dependencies packed onto themselves). Packing
    will be done using depak.

    If depak.conf exists in your dist's top-level directory, it will be used
    as the depak configuration.

    In addition to replacing scripts with the packed version, it will also
    search for directives "# PACKED_MODULES" and "# PACKED_DISTS" in module
    files and replace them with %PACKED_MODULES and @PACKED_DISTS. The
    %PACKED_MODULES hash lists all the modules that are included in the one
    of the scripts. This can be useful for tools that might need it.
    @PACKED_DISTS array lists all the dists that are included in one of the
    scripts. This also can be useful for tools that might need it, like
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::CheckDepDists.

    There is also "# PACKED_CONTENTS_POD" which you can put in your script.
    It will be replaced with POD that list the packed modules/dists.

CONFIGURATION
  include_script = str+
    Explicitly include only specified script. Can be specified multiple
    times. The default, when no "include_script" configuration is specified,
    is to include all scripts in the distribution.

  exclude_script = str+
    Exclude a script. Can be specified multiple times.

  put_hook_at_the_end => bool
    Will be passed to "depak".
