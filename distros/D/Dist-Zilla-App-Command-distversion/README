NAME

    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::distversion - report your dist version

DESCRIPTION

    Tries to output the current version of your distribution onto stdout

SYNOPSIS

        $ dzil distversion
        0.01
    
        $ dzil distversion --rc
        0.01-rc1

OPTIONS

 rc

    Produce a release candidate version. This is defined as your dist
    version with the suffix -rcN, where N is either 1, or 1 more than the
    previous RC version.

    Since dzil doesn't care about the output of this module, nor tracks RC
    versions for you, the module currently looks for git tags matching your
    dist version. Later, this will be configurable. Any tag matching
    /^v$distversion-rc(\d+)/ is considered a release candidate tag, and if
    none is found, we use 1.

    Any tag matching /^v$distversion/ is considered a problem and we emit a
    warning.
