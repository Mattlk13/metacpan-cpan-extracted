NAME
    Data::Clean::ForJSON::Pregen - Clean data so it is safe to output to
    JSON

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Data::Clean::ForJSON::Pregen
    (from Perl distribution Data-Clean-ForJSON-Pregen), released on
    2019-09-08.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Clean::ForJSON::Pregen qw(clean_for_json_in_place clone_and_clean_for_json);

     clean_for_json_in_place($data);
     $cleaned = clone_and_clean_for_json($data);

DESCRIPTION
    This has the same functionality as Data::Clean::ForJSON except that the
    code to perform the cleaning is pre-generated, so we no longer need
    Data::Clean or Data::Clean::ForJSON during runtime.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default.

  clean_for_json_in_place($data)
  clone_and_clean_for_json($data) => $cleaned
