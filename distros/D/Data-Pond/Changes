version 0.004; 2012-02-05

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation

  * correct a typo in documentation

  * correct dynamic_config setting to 0

  * include META.json in distribution

version 0.003; 2010-10-20

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * in XS, use newSVpvs() and sv_catpvs_nomg() wherever appropriate

version 0.001; 2009-05-15

    pond_read_datum())
