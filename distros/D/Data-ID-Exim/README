NAME

Data::ID::Exim - generate Exim message IDs

DESCRIPTION

This module supplies functions which generate IDs using the algorithms
that the Exim MTA uses to generate message IDs, and functions to
manipulate such IDs.  Exim has two schemes for message IDs, one using
base 62 to compactly represent numeric components and one using base
36.  Base 62 is the preferred system, and is used where filenames are
case-sensitive.  Base 36, which yields monocase (specifically uppercase)
message IDs, is used where filenames are case-insensitive.  Apart from
the radix the two schemes are very similar.  This module supplies separate
functions for the two schemes.
