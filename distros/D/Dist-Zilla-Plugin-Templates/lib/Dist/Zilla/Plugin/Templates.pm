=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Templates - Treat source files as templates

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.6.4, released on 2016-12-28 20:24 UTC.

=head1 WHAT?

C<Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Templates> (or just C<Templates> for brevity) is a C<Dist-Zilla> plugin allowing developers
to insert Perl code fragments into arbitrary source text files, which become I<templates>. When
C<Dist::Zilla> builds the distribution each code fragment is evaluated and replaced with result of
evaluation.

This is C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Templates> module documentation. Read this if you are going to hack or
extend C<Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Templates>.

If you want to treat source files as templates, read the L<manual|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Templates::Manual>. General
topics like getting source, building, installing, bug reporting and some others are covered in the
F<README>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implementation of the plugin is trivial. It just consumes few roles which do all the work:
C<FileFinderUser> provides a list of files, C<TextTemplater> process them.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 munge_files

This is the primary method of the plugin. It is called by C<Dist::Zilla> during build. The method
iterates through the files provided by C<< $self->found_files >> (a method defined in
C<FileFinderUser> role) and process each file with C<< $self->fill_in_file >> (a method defined in
C<TextTemplater> role). That's all, folks.

=head2 include

This method implements same-name template function. Normally, templates should call the function,
not method:

    {{ include( 'filename' ); }}

However, if something wrong with the function, file inclusion can be made through the method call:

    {{ $plugin->include( 'filename' ); }}
