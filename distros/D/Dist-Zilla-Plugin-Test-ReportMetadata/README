Name

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportMetadata - Report on prerequisite
    versions during automated testing

Synopsis

       # In dist.ini
       [Test::ReportMetadata]

Description

    The is a clone of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportPrereqs but with the
    dependency on ExtUtils::MakeMaker replaced with one on
    Module::Metadata. If you are using Module::Build then Module::Metadata
    is already a dependency

    Versions are reported based on the result of the version attribute from
    Module::Metadata

    Additionally a selection of environment variables are also displayed

Configuration and Environment

    Defines the following attributes;

    env_vars

      An array reference of environment variable names displayed on the
      test report. Set using the multivalued initialisation argument
      env_var. If the list has no values then nothing is printed. An empty
      list can be set with

         [Test::ReportMetadata]
         env_var = none

    excludes

      An array reference of module names to exclude from the test report.
      Set using the multivalued initialisation argument exclude

    includes

      An array reference of module names to include in the test report. Set
      using the multivalued initialisation argument include

      prerequisites are not satisfied
