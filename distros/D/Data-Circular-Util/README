SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

SEE ALSO

    SHARYANTO

    Data::Structure::Util has the XS version of has_circular_ref which is
    at least around 3 times faster than this module's implementation which
    is pure Perl. Use that instead if possible (in some cases,
    Data::Structure::Util fails to build and this module provides an
    alternative for that function). Data::Structure::Util does not the
    equivalent of this module's clone_circular_refs though.

    This module is however much faster than Devel::Cycle.
