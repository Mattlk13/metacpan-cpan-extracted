Release history for perl-Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Hook:

v0.8.3 @ 2016-11-25 22:04 UTC

    -   Example directory renamed from `ex/` to `eg/`. Metacpan now shows example files correctly
        (before many example files were shown in Documentation section).

v0.8.2 @ 2016-11-03 22:18 UTC

    -   Test fixed to pass under `Dist::Zilla` v6.0.0.

    -   Minor fixes in the POD.

v0.8.1 @ 2015-11-16 23:09 UTC

    -   One test fails on Perl 5.8 due to slightly different error message. The test fixed to
        accept both variants.

v0.8.0 @ 2015-11-14 09:24 UTC

    -   `Hook::ModuleMaker` plugin added.

    -   `Hooker` role: `prologue` and `line_directive` methods are renamed to `_prologue` and
        `_line_directive` to make them private.

    -   `use version 0.77;` added to all the modules.

    -   Bug in `VersionHandling` example found: The example assumes root directory is current,
        while sometimes it is not. Fixed.

    -   Added new example: `AdaptiveTestVersion`.

    -   Minor changes to make `Test::Portability` and `Test::Synopsis` happy.

    -   Short version of license notice used in POD.

0.007 @ 2015-08-13 19:35 UTC

    -   Bug: If Hook name contains space(s), in case of error the message will report error in
        prologue (with line number greater than actual number of lines in prologue). Fixed.

    -   `ReadMe.pod` dropped.

    -   `Releaser` module added.

0.006 @ 2015-08-11 20:12 UTC

    -   Minor changes in examples.

    -   Tests explicitly require `Moose` v2.0800. Older `Moose` may cause test failure.

    -   "Multiple Hooks of the Same Type" section added to manual.

    -   One more attempt to remove `BUGS.pod` from documentation. Replacing `=head1` with `=head2`

        did not help, now I try to drop `=cut`.

0.005 @ 2015-08-07 22:29 UTC

    -   New module/role added: `PrereqSource`. It defines method `register_prereqs`.

    -   One test failed on older Perl versions due to new package syntax `package Foo { … }`.
        Test fixed to use old syntax `{ package Foo; … }`. Should work for older Perls.

    -   VersionHandling example: `Perl::Version` used to bump version.

    -   TemplateVariables example: CPAN treats example file `BUGS.pod` as documentation. At the
        same time it does not treat `README.pod` as documentation. `=head1` in `BUGS.pod` is
        replaced with `=head2`, I hope it will remove `BUGS.pod` from documentation files.

0.004 @ 2015-08-06 12:43 UTC

    -   Localizing `$@` variable fixed to work in pre-5.14 Perls.

0.003 @ 2015-07-25 21:49 UTC

    -   Few errors fixed in documentation.

    -   Tests on many platforms fail due to missed module. Added a hint to let `AutoPrereqs`
        detect this dependency.

    -   Tests on many platforms fail due to slightly different error messages printed by various
        versions of Perl interpreter. The test fixed to accept any variation.

0.002 @ 2015-07-23 22:08 UTC

    -   `[Hook/prologue]` implemented.

    -   `UnwantedDependencies` example added.

    -   `$zilla` variable added.
