=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Hook - Write C<Dist::Zilla> plugin directly in F<dist.ini>

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.8.3, released on 2016-11-25 22:04 UTC.

=head1 WHAT?

C<Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Hook> (or just C<Hook>) is a set of C<Dist-Zilla> plugins. Every plugin executes Perl
code inlined into F<dist.ini> at particular stage of build process.

This is C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Hook> module documentation. Read this if you are going to hack or
extend C<Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Hook>.

If you want to write C<Dist::Zilla> plugin directly in F<dist.ini>, read the L<manual|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Hook::Manual>. General
topics like getting source, building, installing, bug reporting and some others are covered in the
F<README>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin consumes C<Hooker> role like all other C<Hook> plugins. However, this plugin I<never>
executes its Perl code. Instead, it just stores it for later use. As of today, only C<Hook> plugin
with C<prologue> name is actually used:

    [Hook/prologue]
        . = use autodie ':all';

Such code will be executed just before each hook. Note again: C<Hook> itself does not execute its
code; if there are no other hooks in F<dist.ini>, this code will never execute.

BTW, C<Dist::Zilla> and CPAN do not handle well distributions with no main module. This is also a
"main" module of C<Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Hook> distribution, to make C<Dist::Zilla> and C<CPAN> indexer happy.
