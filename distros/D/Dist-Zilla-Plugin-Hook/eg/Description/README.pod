=head2 I<Description> Meta Resource

Distribution meta information contains such items as I<name>, I<version>, I<abstract> and many
others. All named items are written to F<META.json> (and maybe to F<META.yml>) automatically, all
you need is just using C<MetaJSON> and/or C<MetaYAML> plugin(s) in your F<dist.ini> file.

Meta information may also include I<description> â€” a longer, more complete description of the
distribution. However, C<Dist::Zilla> does not provide option to specify I<description>. It could
be easily fixed with C<Hook>, though.
