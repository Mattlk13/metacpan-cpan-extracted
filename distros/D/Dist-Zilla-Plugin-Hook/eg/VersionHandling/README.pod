=head2 Version Handling

I want the version of my distribution is bumped automatically after each release, and automatically
assigned version should be alpha (trial) one.

For example: if I released version "0.001", the version of the next release should be "0.001_01".
When I release "0.001_01", the next should be "0.001_02", the next one — "0.001_03" and so on.
When I decide it is time to non-trial release, I will reset the version to "0.002" manually,
release it, and will have automatically bumped version "0.002_01".

This is implemented with two plugins: C<Hook:VersionProvider> and C<Hook::AfterRelease>. The first
one reads version from external file F<VERSION> which contains only version and nothing more (ok,
trailing newline is allowed) — it simplifies implementation, because there is no need in parsing
F<dist.ini> file. The second plugin bumps the version after release with help from C<Perl::Version>
module, and writes bumped version back to the F<VERSION> file.
