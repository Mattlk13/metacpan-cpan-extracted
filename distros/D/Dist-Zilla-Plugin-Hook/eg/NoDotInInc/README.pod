=head2 Let C<[=inc::Foo]> work in Perl v5.26+.

Starting from Perl v26.0, C<.> is not included into C<@INC> anymore. This breaks C<Dist::Zilla>
syntax for plugins which are located in the distribution source tree, e. g.:

    [=inc::Foo]

Being run with Perl v5.26+, C<dzil> complains:

    Required plugin inc::Foo isn't installed.

C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::lib> was created specially for workarounding this issue. (I said
"workarounding" not "solving" because C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::lib> does not help C<dzil authordeps
--missing> to work.)

The same effect can be achieved with C<Hook::Init> one-liner.
