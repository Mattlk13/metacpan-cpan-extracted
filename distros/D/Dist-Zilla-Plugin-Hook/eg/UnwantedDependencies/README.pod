=head2 Unwanted Dependencies

C<Data::Printer> is a great module, I often use it for debugging. However, sometimes I forget to
remove

    use DDP;

from the code and make a release with this unwanted dependency. C<Hook::BeforeRelease> checks the
distribution does not have unwanted dependencies. If it does, release will be aborted.
