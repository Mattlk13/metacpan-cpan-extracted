=head2 Template Variables

In a distribution, I have to duplicate the same pieces of information again and again. For example,
bug report email and web URLs should be written in C<[MetaResources]> section of F<dist.ini> and in
the documentation, like F<BUGS.pod>.

With a help from C<Templates> plugin I can eliminate duplication. If F<BUGS.pod> is a template,
I can use email and web URLs defined in F<dist.ini>, e. g.:

    {{$dist->distmeta->{resources}->{bugtracker}->{mailto};}}

Errâ€¦ This works but requires a lot of typing (so it is typo-prone), and looks ugly. With C<Hook> I
can make it not only working, but also elegant. C<[Hook::Init]> section defines few variables in
C<MY> package, which can be used in various templates, including documentation and meta resources.
