NAME

    Device::Chip::SDCard - chip driver for SD and MMC cards

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::SDCard;
       use Future::AsyncAwait;
    
       my $card = Device::Chip::SDCard->new;
    
       await $card->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new );
    
       await $card->initialise;
    
       my $bytes = await $card->read_block( 0 );
    
       print "Read block zero:\n";
       printf "%v02X\n", $bytes;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to an SD or
    MMC storage card attached via an SPI adapter.

    At present it only supports MMC and SDSC ("standard capacity") cards,
    not SDHC or SDXC.

METHODS

    The following methods documented in an await expression return Future
    instances.

 initialise

       await $card->initialise;

    Checks that an SD card is present, switches it into SPI mode and waits
    for its initialisation process to complete.

 size

       $n_bytes = await $card->size;

    Returns the size of the media card in bytes.

 read_csd

       $data = await $card->read_csd;

    Returns a HASH reference containing decoded fields from the SD card's
    CSD ("card-specific data") register.

    This hash will contain the following fields:

       TAAC
       NSAC
       TRAN_SPEED
       CCC
       READ_BL_LEN
       READ_BL_LEN_PARTIAL
       WRITE_BLK_MISALIGN
       READ_BLK_MISALIGN
       DSR_IMP
       C_SIZE
       VDD_R_CURR_MIN
       VDD_R_CURR_MAX
       VDD_W_CURR_MIN
       VDD_W_CURR_MAX
       C_SIZE_MULT
       ERASE_BLK_EN
       SECTOR_SIZE
       WP_GRP_SIZE
       WP_GRP_ENABLE
       R2W_FACTOR
       WRITE_BL_LEN
       WRITE_BL_PARTIAL
       FILE_FORMAT_GRP
       COPY
       PERM_WRITE_PROTECT
       TEMP_WRITE_PROTECT
       FILE_FORMAT

    The hash will also contain the following calculated fields, derived
    from the decoded fields above for convenience of calling code.

       blocks          # number of blocks implied by C_SIZE / C_SIZE_MULT
       bytes           # number of bytes of storage, implied by blocks and READ_BL_LEN

 read_ocr

       $fields = await $card->read_ocr;

    Returns a HASH reference containing decoded fields from the card's OCR
    ("operating conditions register").

    This hash will contain the following fields:

       BUSY
       CCS
       UHS_II
       1V8_ACCEPTED
       3V5, 3V4, 3V3, ..., 2V7

 read_block

       $bytes = await $card->read_block( $lba );

    Returns a 512-byte bytestring containing data read from the given
    sector of the card.

TODO

      * Support block writing.

      * Support the different initialisation sequence (and block size
      requirements) of SDHC cards.
