SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [EnsureSQLSchemaVersionedTest]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin checks if SQL::Schema::Versioned is in the RuntimeRequires
    prereq. If it is, then the plugin requires that
    xt/author/sql_schema_versioned.t exists, to make sure that the dist
    author has added a test for schema creation/upgrades.

    Typical xt/author/sql_schema_versioned.t is as follow (identifiers in
    all-caps refer to project-specific names):

     #!perl
    
     use PROJ::MODULE;
     use Test::More 0.98;
     use Test::SQL::Schema::Versioned;
     use Test::WithDB::SQLite;
    
     sql_schema_spec_ok(
         $PROJ::MODULE::DB_SCHEMA_SPEC,
         Test::WithDB::SQLite->new,
     );
     done_testing;
