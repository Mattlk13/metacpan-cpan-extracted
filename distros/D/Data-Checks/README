SYNOPSIS

    With Signature::Attribute::Checked:

       use v5.26;
       use Sublike::Extended;
       use Signature::Attribute::Checked;
    
       use Data::Checks qw( Str );
    
       extended sub greet ( $message :Checked(Str) ) {
          say "Hello, $message";
       }
    
       greet( "world" );  # is fine
       greet( undef );    # throws an exception

    With Object::Pad::FieldAttr::Checked:

       use v5.22;
       use Object::Pad;
       use Object::Pad::FieldAttr::Checked;
    
       use Data::Checks qw( Str );
    
       class Datum {
          field $name :param :reader :Checked(Str);
       }
    
       my $x = Datum->new( name => "something" );  # is fine
       my $y = Datum->new( name => undef );        # throws an exception

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides functions that implement various value constraint
    checking behaviours. These are the parts made visible by the use
    Data::Checks ... import line, in Perl code.

    It also provides the underlying common framework XS functions to assist
    in writing modules that actually implement such constraint checking.
    These parts are not visible in Perl code, but instead made visible at
    the XS level by the #include "DataChecks.h" directive.

CONSTRAINTS

    The following constraint checks are inspired by the same-named ones in
    Types::Standard. They may be called fully-qualified, or imported
    lexically into the calling scope.

    Note to users familiar with Types::Standard: some of these functions
    behave slightly differently. In particular, these constraints are
    generally happy to accept an object reference to a class that provides
    a conversion overload, whereas the ones in Types::Standard often are
    not. Additionally functions that are parametric take their parameters
    in normal Perl function argument lists, not wrapped in additional array
    references.

 Defined

       Defined()

    Accepts any defined value, rejects only undef.

 Object

       Object()

    Accepts any blessed object reference, rejects non-references or
    references to unblessed data.

 Str

       Str()

    Accepts any defined non-reference value, or a reference to an object in
    a class that overloads stringification. rejects undefined, unblessed
    references, or references to objects in classes that do not overload
    stringification.

 StrEq

       StrEq($s)
       StrEq($s1, $s2, ...)

    Since version 0.05.

    Accepts any value that passes the Str check, and additionally is
    exactly equal to any of the given strings.

 Num

       Num()

    Accepts any defined non-reference value that is either a plain number,
    or a string that could be used as one without warning, or a reference
    to an object in a class that overloads numification. rejects undefined,
    strings that would raise a warning if converted to a number, unblessed
    references, or references to objects in classes that do not overload
    numification.

 NumGT

 NumGE

 NumLE

 NumLT

       NumGT($bound)
       NumGE($bound)
       NumLE($bound)
       NumLT($bound)

    Since version 0.05.

    Accepts any value that passes the Num check, and additionally is within
    the bound given. NumGT and NumLT exclude the bound value itself, NumGE
    and NumLE include it.

 NumRange

       NumRange($boundge, $boundlt)

    Since version 0.05.

    Accepts any value that passes the Num check, and additionally is
    between the two bounds given. The lower bound is inclusive, and the
    upper bound is exclusive.

    This choice is made so that a set of NumRange constraints can easily be
    created that cover distinct sets of numbers:

       NumRange(0, 10), NumRange(10, 20), NumRange(20, 30), ...

 NumEq

       NumEq($n)
       NumEq($n1, $n2, ...)

    Since version 0.05.

    Accepts any value that passes the Num check, and additionally is
    exactly equal to any of the given numbers.

 Isa

       Isa($classname)

    Since version 0.04.

    Accepts any blessed object reference to an instance of the given class
    name, or a subclass derived from it (i.e. anything accepted by the isa
    operator).

 Maybe

       Maybe($C)

    Since version 0.04.

    Accepts undef in addition to anything else accepted by the given
    constraint.

XS FUNCTIONS

    The following functions are provided by the DataChecks.h header file
    for use in XS modules that implement value constraint checking.

 boot_data_checks

       void boot_data_checks(double ver);

    Call this function from your BOOT section in order to initialise the
    module and load the rest of the support functions.

    ver should either be 0 or a decimal number for the module version
    requirement; e.g.

       boot_data_checks(0.01);

 make_checkdata

       struct DataChecks_Checker *make_checkdata(SV *checkspec);

    Creates a struct DataChecks_Checker structure, which wraps the intent
    of the value constraint check. The returned value is used as the
    checker argument for the remaining functions.

    The constraint check itself is specified by the SV given by checkspec,
    which should come directly from the user code. The constraint check may
    be specified in any of three ways:

      * An object reference in a class which has a check method. Value
      checks will be invoked as

         $ok = $checkerobj->check( $value );

      * A package name as a plain string of a package which has a check
      method. Value checks will be invoked as

         $ok = $checkerpkg->check( $value );

      * A code reference. Value checks will be invoked with a single
      argument, as

         $ok = $checkersub->( $value );

      * Additionally, the constraint check functions provided by this
      module may be implemented using any of the above mechanisms, or may
      use an unspecified fourth different mechanism. Outside code should
      not rely on what that mechanism may be.

    Once constructed into a checker structure, the choice of which
    implementation is used is fixed, and if a method lookup is involved its
    result is stored directly as a CV pointer for efficiency of later
    invocations. In either of the first two cases, the reference count on
    the checkspec SV is increased to account for the argument value used on
    each invocation. In the third case, the reference SV is not retained,
    but the underlying CV it refers to has its reference count increased.

 free_checkdata

       void free_checkdata(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker);

    Releases any stored SVs in the checker structure, and the structure
    itself.

 gen_assertmess

       void gen_assertmess(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, SV *name, SV *constraint);

    Generates and stores a message string for the assert message to be used
    by "make_assertop" and "assert_value". The message will take the form

       NAME requires a value satisfying CONSTRAINT

    Both name and constraint SVs used as temporary strings to generate the
    stored message string. Neither SV is retained by the checker directly.

 make_assertop

       OP *make_assertop(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, OP *argop);

    Creates an optree fragment for a value check assertion operation.

    Given an optree fragment in scalar context that generates an argument
    value (argop), constructs a larger optree fragment that consumes it and
    checks that the value is accepted by the constraint check given by
    checker. The returned optree fragment will operate in void context
    (i.e. it does not yield the argument value itself).

 check_value

       bool check_value(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, SV *value);

    Checks whether a given SV is accepted by the given constraint check,
    returning true if so, or false if not.

 assert_value

       void assert_value(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, SV *value);

    Checks whether a given SV is accepted by the given constraint check,
    throwing its assertion message if it does not.

TODO

      * Unit constraints - maybe Int, some plain-only variants of Str and
      Num, some reference types, etc...

      * Parametric constraints - StrMatch

      * Structural constraints - HashOf, ArrayOf, etc...
