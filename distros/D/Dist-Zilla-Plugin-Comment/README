SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Comment]

    In lib/Foo.pm:

     ...
    
     do_something(); # COMMENT
    
     # BEGIN_COMMENT
     one();
     two();
     three();
     # END_COMMENT
    
     =pod
    
     =for BEGIN_COMMENT
    
     blah
     blah
     blah
    
     =for END_COMMENT
    
     ...

    After build, lib/Foo.pm will become:

     ...
    
     ## do_something(); # COMMENT
    
     # BEGIN_COMMENT
     ## one();
     ## two();
     ## three();
     # END_COMMENT
    
     =pod
    
     =for BEGIN_COMMENT
    
     ## blah
     ## blah
     ## blah
    
     =for END_COMMENT
    
     ...

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin finds lines that end with # COMMENT, or blocks of lines
    delimited by # BEGIN COMMENT ... # END_COMMENT or =for BEGIN_COMMENT
    ... =end END_COMMENT and comment them out.

    This can be used, e.g. to do stuffs only when the source file is not
    the dzil-built version, usually for testing.

SEE ALSO

    You can use this plugin in conjunction with
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertBlock. DZP:InsertBlock can insert lines that
    will only be available in the dzil-built version. While for the raw
    version, you can use DZP:Comment plugin to make lines that will be
    commented-out in the dzil-built version.
