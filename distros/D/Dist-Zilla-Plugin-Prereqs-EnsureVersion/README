SYNOPSIS

    In ~/pmversions.ini:

     Log::Any::IfLOG=0.07
     File::Write::Rotate=0.28

    In dist.ini:

     [Prereqs::EnsureVersion]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will check versions specified in prereqs. First you create
    ~/pmversions.ini containing list of modules and their mininum versions.
    Then, the plugin will check all prereqs against this list. If minimum
    version is not met (e.g. the prereq says 0 or a smaller version) then
    the build will be aborted.

    Ideas for future version: ability to blacklist certain versions,
    specify version ranges, e.g.:

     Module::Name = 1.00-2.00, != 1.93

SEE ALSO

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPrereqs

    There are some plugins on CPAN related to specifying/detecting Perl's
    minimum version, e.g.: Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPerl,
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion.
