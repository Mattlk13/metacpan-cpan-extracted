NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::EnsureVersion - Make sure that prereqs
    have minimum versions

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::EnsureVersion (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Prereqs-EnsureVersion), released on 2017-07-28.

SYNOPSIS
    In ~/pmversions.ini:

     Log::Any::IfLOG=0.07
     File::Write::Rotate=0.28

    In dist.ini:

     [Prereqs::EnsureVersion]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will check versions specified in prereqs. First you create
    ~/pmversions.ini containing list of modules and their mininum versions.
    Then, the plugin will check all prereqs against this list. If minimum
    version is not met (e.g. the prereq says 0 or a smaller version) then
    the build will be aborted.

    Currently, prereqs with custom (/^x_/) phase or relationship are
    ignored.

    Ideas for future version: ability to blacklist certain versions, specify
    version ranges, e.g.:

     Module::Name = 1.00-2.00, != 1.93
