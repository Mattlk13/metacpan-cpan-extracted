VERSION

    version 0.003

DESCRIPTION

        ; in dzil.ini
        [UploadToSFTP]
        site        = sftp.geocities.invalid
        directory   = /Heartland/Meadows/3044

    This is a Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser plugin that uploads a
    distribution tarball to an SFTP site. It can be used in addition to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN or in its place. In fact I wrote it
    for the latter case so that I could release proprietary distributions
    inhouse.

 .netrc file

    The .netrc file is described in Net::Netrc and should have an entry in
    it matching the site given in the dzil.ini file and specifying the
    username and password.

ATTRIBUTES

 site

    The SFTP site to upload to.

 directory

    The directory on the SFTP site to upload the tarball to.

 debug

    Tells ssh to run in verbose mode. Defaults to 0.

METHODS

 release

    Uploads the tarball to the specified site and directory.
