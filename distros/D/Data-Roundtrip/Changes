0.05	2020-04-16
	Makefile.PL minor modification.

0.07	2020-04-20
	Changed default options for scripts so that they don't do pretty
	printing by default.
	Added import parameters 'no-unicode-escape-permanently'
	and 'unicode-escape-permanently' for efficient use of *2dump*
	subs.
	Added benchmarks to time 2dump subs and inserted target in Makefile.

0.08	2020-04-20
	Removed dependency to Sub::Override, overriding subs is done by us now.
	Fixed POD mistakes.

0.09	2020-04-20

0.10	2020-04-20
	Added minimum version for Test::Script to be 1.09
	to support script_stderr_is. Thank you Slaven Rezić!)

0.11	2020-04-21
	Checked failures for test script t/02-random-data-structure.t
	and provided a fix and added a warning in CAVEATS section.

0.12	2023-03-09
	Wrapped within an eval{}, call to JSON::decode_json in sub json2perl.
	This allows graceful death when input json is not valid.

0.13	2023-03-11
	In the previous version I had forgotten an erroneous INSTALL_BASE
	in Makefile.PL which pointed to $ENV{HOME}/usr.
	This resulted in installing this module in installing user's
	home dir, under usr/
	Now this is fixed. Those who installed the previous version (0.12),
	please make sure to uninstall it from $ENV{HOME}/usr.

0.14	2023-03-11
	See 0.13.
