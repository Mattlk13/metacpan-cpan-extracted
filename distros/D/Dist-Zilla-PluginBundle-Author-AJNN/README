INSTALLATION

The recommended way to install this Perl module distribution is directly
from CPAN with whichever tool you use to manage your installation of Perl.
For example:

  cpanm Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::AJNN

If you already have downloaded the distribution, you can alternatively
point your tool directly at the archive file or the directory:

  cpanm Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-AJNN-0.07.tar.gz

You can also install the module manually by following these steps:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

See https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for general information
on installing CPAN modules.
