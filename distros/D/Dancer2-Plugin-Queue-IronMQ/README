DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a Dancer2::Plugin::Queue using
    IO::Iron::IronMQ::Client.

USAGE
    See documentation for Dancer2::Plugin::Queue.

ATTRIBUTES
  config
    IronMQ uses a JSON config file to hold the project_id and token, and
    other config items if necessary. By default iron.json. These config
    items can also be written individually under *connection_options*. Must
    be supplied.

  queue
    Name of the queue. Must be supplied.

  timeout
    After timeout (in seconds), item will be placed back onto queue. You
    must delete the message from the queue to ensure it does not go back
    onto the queue. If not set, value from queue is used. Default is 60
    seconds, minimum is 30 seconds, and maximum is 86,400 seconds (24
    hours).

  wait
    Time to long poll for messages, in seconds. Max is 30 seconds. Default
    0.

NOTES
    My thanks to https://metacpan.org/author/DAGOLDEN who's
    Dancer2::Plugin::Queue::MongoDB I used as an example when building.
