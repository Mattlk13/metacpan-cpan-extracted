SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [PatchModule]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin is to be used when building patch modules (modules that use
    Module::Patch to bundle a set of monkey patches, for example
    File::Which::Patch::Hide or LWP::UserAgent::Patch::FilterMirror). It
    currently does the following:

      * Check that distribution name is <TARGET_MODULE>-Patch-<DESCRIPTION>

      * Check that a dependency to Module::Patch (at least 0.12) has been
      specified

      * Check that a dependency to target module has been specified
