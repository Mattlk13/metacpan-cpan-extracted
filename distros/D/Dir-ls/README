NAME

    Dir::ls - List the contents of a directory

SYNOPSIS

      use Dir::ls;
      
      print "$_\n" for ls; # defaults to current working directory
      
      print "$_: ", -s "/foo/bar/$_", "\n" for ls '/foo/bar', {all => 1, sort => 'size'};

DESCRIPTION

    Provides the function "ls", which returns the contents of a directory
    in a similar manner to the GNU coreutils command ls(1).

FUNCTIONS

 ls

      my @contents = ls $dir, \%options;

    Takes a directory path and optional hashref of options, and returns a
    list of items in the directory. Home directories represented by ~ will
    be expanded by "path" in Path::Tiny. If no directory path is passed,
    the current working directory will be used. Like in ls(1), the returned
    names are relative to the passed directory path, so if you want to use
    a filename (such as passing it to open or stat), you must prefix it
    with the directory path, with ~ expanded if present.

      # Check the size of a file in current user's home directory
      my @contents = ls '~';
      say -s glob('~') . "/$contents[0]";

    By default, hidden files and directories (those starting with .) are
    omitted, and the results are sorted by name according to the current
    locale (see perllocale for more information).

    Accepts the following options:

    a

    all

      Include hidden files and directories.

    A

    almost-all

      Include hidden files and directories, but not . or ...

    c

      Sort by ctime (change time) in seconds since the epoch.

    f

      Equivalent to passing all and setting sort to none.

    r

    reverse

      Reverse sort order (unless U or sort => 'none' specified).

    sort

      Specify sort algorithm other than the default sort-by-name. Valid
      values are: none, extension, size, time, or version.

    S

      Sort by file size in bytes (descending). Equivalent to sort =>
      'size'.

    t

      Sort by mtime (modification time) in seconds since the epoch.
      Equivalent to sort => 'time'.

    u

      Sort by atime (access time) in seconds since the epoch.

    U

      Return entries in directory order (unsorted). Equivalent to sort =>
      'none'.

    v

      Sort naturally by version numbers within the name. Uses
      Sort::filevercmp for sorting. Equivalent to sort => 'version'.

    X

      Sort by (last) file extension, according to the current locale.
      Equivalent to sort => 'extension'.

CAVEATS

    This is only an approximation of ls(1). It makes an attempt to give the
    same output under the supported options, but there may be differences
    in edge cases. Weird things might happen with sorting of non-ASCII
    filenames, or on non-Unixlike systems. Lots of options aren't supported
    yet. Patches welcome.
