NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec - Ensure prereq to
    spec modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.060 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PERLANCAR-EnsurePrereqToSpec), released
    on 2018-09-22.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec]

DESCRIPTION
    I like to specify prerequisite to spec modules such as Rinci, Riap, Sah,
    Setup, etc as DevelopRecommends, to express that a distribution conforms
    to such specification(s).

    Currently only Rinci is checked.
