SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec]

DESCRIPTION

    I like to specify prerequisite to spec modules such as Rinci, Riap,
    Sah, Setup, etc as DevelopRecommends, to express that a distribution
    conforms to such specification(s).

    Currently only Rinci is checked.
