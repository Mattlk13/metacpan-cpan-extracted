    spec modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.061 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PERLANCAR-EnsurePrereqToSpec), released
    on 2020-06-09.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec]

DESCRIPTION
    I like to specify prerequisite to spec modules such as Rinci, Riap, Sah,
    Setup, etc as (phase=develop, rel=x_spec) dependency, to express that a
    distribution conforms to such specification(s).

    Currently only these spec is checked:

    *   Rinci

        When a package contains Rinci metadata (%SPEC).

    *   ColorTheme

        When there is a ColorTheme/* source files.
