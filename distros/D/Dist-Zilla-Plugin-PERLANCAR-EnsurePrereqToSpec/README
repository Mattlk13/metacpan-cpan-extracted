NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec - Ensure prereq to
    spec modules

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.063 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PERLANCAR-EnsurePrereqToSpec), released
    on 2022-02-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [PERLANCAR::EnsurePrereqToSpec]

DESCRIPTION
    I like to specify prerequisite to spec modules such as Rinci, Riap, Sah,
    Setup, etc as (phase=develop, rel=x_spec) dependency, to express that a
    distribution conforms to such specification(s).

    Currently only these spec is checked:

    *   Rinci

        When a package contains Rinci metadata (%SPEC).

    *   ColorTheme

        When there is a ColorTheme/* source files.

    *   BorderStyle

        When there is a BorderStyle/* source files.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
