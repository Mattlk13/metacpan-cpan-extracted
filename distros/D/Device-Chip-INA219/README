NAME

    Device::Chip::INA219 - chip driver for an INA219

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::INA219;
       use Future::AsyncAwait;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::INA219->new;
       await $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new );
    
       printf "Current bus voltage is %d mV, shunt voltage is %d uV\n",
          await $chip->read_bus_voltage, await $chip->read_shunt_voltage;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a Texas
    Instruments INA219 attached to a computer via an I²C adapter.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

MOUNT PARAMETERS

 addr

    The I²C address of the device. Can be specified in decimal, octal or
    hex with leading 0 or 0x prefixes.

METHODS

    The following methods documented in an await expression return Future
    instances.

 read_config

       $config = await $chip->read_config;

    Reads and returns the current chip configuration as a HASH reference.

 change_config

       await $chip->change_config( %config );

    Changes the configuration. Any field names not mentioned will be
    preserved.

 read_shunt_voltage

       $uv = await $chip->read_shunt_voltage;

    Returns the current shunt voltage reading scaled integer in microvolts.

 read_bus_voltage

       $mv = await $chip->read_bus_voltage;
    
       ( $mv, $ovf, $cnvr ) = await $chip->read_bus_voltage;

    Returns the current bus voltage reading, as a scaled integer in
    milivolts.

    The returned Future also yields the OVF and CNVR flags.
