NAME

    Device::Chip::INA219 - chip driver for an INA219

SYNOPSIS

     use Device::Chip::INA219;
    
     my $chip = Device::Chip::INA219->new;
     $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new )->get;
    
     printf "Current bus voltage is %d mV, shunt voltage is %d uV\n",
        $chip->read_bus_voltage->get, $chip->read_shunt_voltage->get;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a Texas
    Instruments INA219 attached to a computer via an I²C adapter.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

MOUNT PARAMETERS

 addr

    The I²C address of the device. Can be specified in decimal, octal or
    hex with leading 0 or 0x prefixes.

METHODS

    The following methods documented with a trailing call to ->get return
    Future instances.

 read_config

       $config = $chip->read_config->get

    Reads and returns the current chip configuration as a HASH reference.

 change_config

       $chip->change_config( %config )->get

    Changes the configuration. Any field names not mentioned will be
    preserved.

 read_shunt_voltage

       $uv = $chip->read_shunt_voltage->get

    Returns the current shunt voltage reading scaled integer in microvolts.

 read_bus_voltage

       $mv = $chip->read_bus_voltage->get
    
       ( $mv, $ovf, $cnvr ) = $chip->read_bus_voltage->get

    Returns the current bus voltage reading, as a scaled integer in
    milivolts.

    The returned Future also yields the OVF and CNVR flags.
