NAME

    Device::Chip::Adapter::CH341A - a Device::Chip::Adapter implementation

DESCRIPTION

    This class implements the Device::Chip::Adapter interface for the
    CH341A USB interface chip, allowing an instance of a Device::Chip
    driver to communicate with actual chip hardware using this adapter.

    The CH341A is often found in cheap USB serial memory programmers and
    similar devices, for programming SPI or I²C EEPROM and flash memory
    chips.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

       $adapter = Device::Chip::Adapter::CH341A->new

    Returns a new instance of a Device::Chip::Adapter::CH341A.

PROTOCOLS

    The following Device::Chip::Adapter protocol types are supported

      * SPI
