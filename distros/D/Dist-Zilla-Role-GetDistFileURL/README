NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Role::GetDistFileURL - Get URL to a file inside a Perl
    distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Dist::Zilla::Role::GetDistFileURL (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Role-GetDistFileURL), released on 2023-11-09.

PROVIDED METHODS
  get_dist_file_url
    Usage:

     my $url = $obj->get_dist_file_url($hosting, $path);

    Example:

     my $url = $obj->get_dist_file_url('metacpan', 'share/image/image1.jpg');
     my $url = $obj->get_dist_file_url('github', 'META.json');

    Known hosting:

    *   metacpan

        This is the default because all distributions uploaded to PAUSE/CPAN
        will normally show up on metacpan.org. Note that for images, some
        people advise not to abuse metacpan.org to host images because
        metacpan.org is not an image hosting service. However, at the time
        of this writing, I couldn't find any mention of this in the
        metacpan.org FAQ or About pages.

    *   github

        This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository
        in its metadata, and the repository URL's host is github.com.

    *   gitlab

        This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository
        in its metadata, and the repository URL's host is gitlab.org.

    *   bitbucket

        This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository
        in its metadata, and the repository URL's host is bitbucket.org.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
