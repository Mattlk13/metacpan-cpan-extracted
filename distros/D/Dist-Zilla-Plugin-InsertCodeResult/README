NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult - Insert the result of Perl code
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.050 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCodeResult), released on 2018-04-06.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCodeResult]
     ;make_verbatim=1

    In your POD:

     # CODE: require MyLib; MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# CODE: ..." directives in your POD, evals the
    specified Perl code, and insert the result into your POD as a verbatim
    paragraph (unless you set "make_verbatim" to 0, in which case output
    will be inserted as-is). If result is a simple scalar, it is printed as
    is. If it is undef or a reference, it will be dumped using Data::Dump.
    If eval fails, build will be aborted.
