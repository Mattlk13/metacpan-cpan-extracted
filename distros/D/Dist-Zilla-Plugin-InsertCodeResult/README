SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCodeResult]
     ;make_verbatim=1

    In your POD:

     # CODE: require MyLib; MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");

DESCRIPTION

    This module finds # CODE: ... directives in your POD, evals the
    specified Perl code, and insert the result into your POD as a verbatim
    paragraph (unless you set make_verbatim to 0, in which case output will
    be inserted as-is). If result is a simple scalar, it is printed as is.
    If it is undef or a reference, it will be dumped using Data::Dump. If
    eval fails, build will be aborted.
