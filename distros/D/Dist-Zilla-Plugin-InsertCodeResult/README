NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult - Insert the result of Perl code
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.056 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCodeResult), released on 2023-12-11.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCodeResult]
     ;make_verbatim=1

    In your POD:

     # CODE: require MyLib; MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");

    or for multiline code:

     # BEGIN_CODE
     require MyLib;
     MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");
     ...
     # END_CODE

    (you can prefix each line in multiline code with comment, to prevent
    this code from being analyzed by other analyzers e.g. scan_prereqs):

     # BEGIN_CODE
     #require MyLib;
     #MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");
     #...
     # END_CODE

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# CODE: ..." or "# BEGIN_CODE" and "# END CODE"
    directives in your POD, evals the specified Perl code, and insert the
    result into your POD as a verbatim paragraph (unless you set
    "make_verbatim" to 0, in which case output will be inserted as-is). If
    result is a simple scalar, it is printed as is. If it is undef or a
    reference, it will be dumped using Data::Dump. If eval fails, build will
    be aborted.

    The directives must be at the first column of the line.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
