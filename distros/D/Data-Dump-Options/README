NAME
    Data::Dump::Options - Like Data::Dump but with some more options

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Data::Dump::Options (from Perl
    distribution Data-Dump-Options), released on 2020-06-04.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use Data::Dump:

     use Data::Dump;
     dd [1,2,3,4];

DESCRIPTION
    A fork of Data::Dump 1.23 to give some dumping options.>

CONFIGURATION
    In addition to Data::Dump's options, there are a few package variables
    that can be set to modify the output generated by the dump functions.
    It's wise to localize the setting of these.

    $Data::Dump::Options::OBJECT_AS
        If set to "string", then objects (blessed references) will just be
        dumped as:

         "$obj"

        which in most cases will be:

         Foo::Bar=ARRAY(0x5653ec564740)

        unless the object overloads stringification (see overload).

        If set to "default_string", then object will be dumped as the
        standard:

         Foo::Bar=ARRAY(0x5653ec564740)

        format even, disregarding object's overloading of stringification.

        Useful if you don't care about objects.

        The default value is "dump".
