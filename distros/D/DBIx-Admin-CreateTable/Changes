Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Admin::CreateTable.

2.11  2021-02-04T15:13:00
	- Reformat Makefile.PL.
	- Change the license from artistic_2 to perl.
	- Add t/00.*.

	- Add Test::Version to the pre-reqs.

2.09  2014-03-06T09:45:07
	- Adopt Moo. But not Moops - I don't need that level of complexity.
	- Move t/pod.t to xt/author/.
	- Add t/version.t.
	- Add use strict and use warnings to Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	- Newsflash: DBIx::Admin::CreateTable and DBIx::Admin::DSNManager are now used for the author's testing of
		DBIx::Admin::TableInfo.

2.08  2014-01-30T09:09:00
	- Fix serious bug in create_table(), which did not allow digits in table and sequence names.
		Many thanx to Mario Zieschang for reporting this. See RT#92560.
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl in the scripts.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.

	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

2.07  2010-05-21T16:51:00
	- Spelling: MySQL uses auto_increment; SQLite uses autoincrement.
		This should have been done for V 2.04.
	- Remove references to Moose and namespace::autoclean from 2.06 below.

2.06  2010-02-21T12:54:54
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.
	- Replace personal doc root with /var/www.

2.05  2010-02-10T13:52:44
	- Add META.yml. Update MANIFEST.SKIP. Add MANIFEST and MYMETA.yml.

2.04  2009-09-16T14:12:00
	  - Change auto_increment to autoincrement for SQLite.
	  - Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES.

2.03  2008-12-04T15:54:00
	- Change licence text in preparation for Debian packaging

2.02  2008-11-23T10:08:00
	- Add DBI to Build.PL and Makefile.PL since:
		o t/2.syntax.error.t uses it
		o CPAN testers were getting errors
		o Callers must create a $dbh, but this module doesn't actually use DBI
	- Fix typo in Changes.txt on the line 2.01...
	- Generate Changelog.ini as I should have with the last version

2.01  2008-11-18T10:34:00
	- Add support for SQLite. Note: My code for SQLite uses 'integer primary key auto_increment'
	  as the definition of the primary key's type. To get the autoincrement part of that to work,
	  you must provide a NULL - i.e. a Perl undef - for your primary key column when inserting a
	  new record into the database

2.00  2008-11-16T12:06:00
	- Convert various files from DOS to Unix format
	- Reformat the source of CreateTable.pm, Build.PL and Makefile.PL, a bit
	- Rename the test files (pod.t => 0.pod.t, test.t => 1.test.t)
	- Add t/2.syntax.error.t
	- Only run tests in t/2.syntax.error.t if $DBI_DSN, $DBI_USER and $DBI_PASS are defined
	- Remove eval
	- Localize RaiseError in drop_table(), so as to not error when table does not exist
	- Make create_table return DBI's errstr() on fail or '' on success, so result can be tested
	- Make drop_table return '' on success, so result can be tested (in t/2.syntax.error.t)
	- Remove FindBin::Real from list of required modules

1.04  2007-08-23T15:31:00
	- Expand docs even more
	- Rename generate_sequence_name() to generate_primary_sequence_name()

1.03  2007-08-15T13:58:00
	- Expand docs per method with tables documenting behaviour per database vendor

1.02  2006-06-09T14:54:00
