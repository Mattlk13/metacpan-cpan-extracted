NAME
    DBIx::Conn::SQLite - Shortcut to connect to SQLite database

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of DBIx::Conn::SQLite (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-Conn-SQLite), released on 2018-07-08.

SYNOPSIS
    In the command-line, instead of saying:

     % perl -MDBI -E'my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:dbname=mydb", "", ""); $dbh->selectrow_array("query"); ...'

    or:

    you can just say:

     % perl -MDBIx::Conn::SQLite=mydb -E'$dbh->selectrow_array("query"); ...'

    To change the exported database variable name from the default '$dbh'

     % perl -MDBIx::Conn::SQLite=mydb,'$handle' -E'$handle->selectrow_array("query"); ...'

    To supply connection attributes:

     % perl -MDBIx::Conn::SQLite=mydb,RaiseError,1 -E'$dbh->selectrow_array("query"); ...'

DESCRIPTION
    This module offers some saving in typing when connecting to a SQLite
    database using DBI, and is particularly handy in one-liners. It
    automatically "connect()" and exports the database handle $dbh for you.

    You often only have to specify the database name in the import argument:

     -MDBIx::Conn::SQLite=mydb

    This will result in the following DSN:

     DBI:SQLite:dbname=mydb

    If you want to use another variable name other than the default $dbh for
    the database handle, you can specify this in the second import argument
    (note the quoting because otherwise the shell will substitute with shell
    variable):

     -MDBIx::Conn::SQLite=mydb,'$handle'

    Lastly, if you want to supply connection attributes, you can do so in
    the third argument and the rest (or second and the rest, if you don't
    customize database handle name):

     -MDBIx::Conn::SQLite=mydb,RaiseError,1
