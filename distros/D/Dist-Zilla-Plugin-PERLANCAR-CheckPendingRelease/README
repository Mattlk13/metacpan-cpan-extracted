NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::CheckPendingRelease - Check for pending
    release before releasing

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::CheckPendingRelease (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PERLANCAR-CheckPendingRelease), released
    on 2020-08-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

     [PERLANCAR::CheckPendingRelease]

DESCRIPTION
    In the BeforeRelease phase, this plugin checks whether the program
    my-pending-perl-release is found in PATH. If the program is found, this
    plugin uses the program to check whether a previous release of the
    distro being built is pending release. And when that is the case, the
    plugin aborts the build to avoid releasing a newer version of the distro
    while another, older version has been built but not yet released.

    This plugin is most probably only useful to me, as I often build but not
    immediately release my distros using Dist::Zilla. I release this plugin
    because this plugin is included in my standard bundle. When the
    "my-pending-perl-release" program is not found in PATH, this plugin will
    do nothing.
