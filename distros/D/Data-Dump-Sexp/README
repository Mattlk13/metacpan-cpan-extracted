Data-Dump-Sexp version 0.001
============================

Data::Dump::Sexp converts Perl structures to S-expressions.

The conversion rules are as follows:

1. A blessed object with a to_sexp method is replaced with the result
   of calling the method, and this procedure is restarted.

2. An instance of Data::SExpression::Symbol is converted to a symbol.

3. An instance of Data::SExpression::Cons is converted to a cons cell
   (like (A . B)), a proper list (like (A B C)) or an improper list
   (like (A B . C)), where A, B, C are S-expressions.

4. undef is converted to the empty list.

5. A defined scalar that looks like a number is left as-is.

6. A defined scalar that does not look like a number is surrounded by
   double quotes after any backslashes and double quote characters are
   escaped with a backslash.

7. An arrayref is converted to a proper list.

8. A hashref is converted to an alist, which is a proper list of cons
   cells (like ((A . B) (C . D) (E . F))).

9. A scalarref or a reference to another ref is dereferenced and this
   procedure is restarted.

10. Anything else (regexp, filehandle, format, glob, version string)
    causes an exception to be raised
