SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Acme::MetaSyntactic]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin can be used when building Acme-MetaSyntactic-* theme
    distribution. It currently does the following:

      * Add a test script xt/release/meta.t (which will become
      t/release-meta.t) unless t/meta.t or t/meta.t already exists

      The test script is something like:

       use Test::MetaSyntactic;
       all_themes_ok();
