NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandOutput - Insert the output of command
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.055 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandOutput (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCommandOutput), released on 2021-06-07.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCommandOutput]
     ;make_verbatim=1

    In your POD:

     # COMMAND: netstat -anp

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# COMMAND: ..." directives in your POD, pass it to
    the Perl's backtick operator, and insert the result into your POD as a
    verbatim paragraph (unless if you set "make_verbatim" to 0, in which
    case output will be inserted as-is). If command fails ($? is non-zero),
    build will be aborted.
