NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandOutput - Insert the output of command
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.057 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandOutput (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCommandOutput), released on 2022-10-28.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCommandOutput]
     ;indent=4
     ;include_command=0
     ;substitute_template=0

    In your POD:

     # COMMAND: netstat -anp

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# COMMAND: ..." directives in your POD, pass it to
    the Perl's backtick operator, and insert the result into your POD as a
    verbatim paragraph (unless if you set "make_verbatim" to 0, in which
    case output will be inserted as-is). If command fails ($? is non-zero),
    build will be aborted.

CONFIGURATION
  indent
    Uint. Default: 1. Number of spaces to indent each line of output with.
    Can be set to 0 to not indent at all.

  include_command
    Bool, default false. If set to true, will also show the command in the
    output.

  capture_stdout
    Bool, default true.

  capture_stderr
    Bool, default false.

  substitute_template
    Bool, default false. If set to true, will substitute some template
    variables in the command with their actual values:

    *   [[prog]]

        The name of the program (guessed from the current filename, and in
        the actual command to execute will be quoted($^X) + " " +
        quoted(filename)). Empty if current filename is not a script.

    *   [[module]]

        The name of the module (guessed from the current filename). Empty if
        current filename is not a module.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
