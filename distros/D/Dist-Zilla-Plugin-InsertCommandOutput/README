SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCommandOutput]
     ;make_verbatim=1

    In your POD:

     # COMMAND: netstat -anp

DESCRIPTION

    This module finds # COMMAND: ... directives in your POD, pass it to the
    Perl's backtick operator, and insert the result into your POD as a
    verbatim paragraph (unless if you set make_verbatim to 0, in which case
    output will be inserted as-is). If command fails ($? is non-zero),
    build will be aborted.

    accomplish the same thing, e.g. with # CODE: my $res = `netstat -anp`;
    die if $?; $res except the DZP::InstallCommandResult plugin is shorter.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeOutput, which can also be used to
