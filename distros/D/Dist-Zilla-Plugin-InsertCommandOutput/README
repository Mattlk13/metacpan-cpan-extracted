NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandOutput - Insert the output of command
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.056 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandOutput (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCommandOutput), released on 2022-06-10.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCommandOutput]
     ;indent=4

    In your POD:

     # COMMAND: netstat -anp

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# COMMAND: ..." directives in your POD, pass it to
    the Perl's backtick operator, and insert the result into your POD as a
    verbatim paragraph (unless if you set "make_verbatim" to 0, in which
    case output will be inserted as-is). If command fails ($? is non-zero),
    build will be aborted.

CONFIGURATION
  indent
    Uint. Default: 1. Number of spaces to indent each line of output with.
    Can be set to 0 to not indent at all.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
