Device-GPIB version 0.01
========================

This module provides Perl Modules and command line programs to access
a variety of generic and specific GPIB devices, via a number of
supported GPIB interfaces.

Generic command line programs can be used to scan the GPIB bus and to
send arbitrary commands and queries to any device that supports GPIB.

Perl Modules and command line programs to access specific
features of a number of HP, Tektronix and Advantest devices are also
provided.

Supports a number of GPIB interfaces and controllers including:

Prologix GPIB-USB Controller and compatibles, including:
   AR488 for Arduino from Twilight-Logic: https://github.com/Twilight-Logic/AR488
      (tested version 0.51.18 with Arduino Nano and custom wiring interface)
   (requires Device::SerialPort)

LinuxGpib compatible devices
   (requires linux-gpib from https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-gpib and its LinuxGpib perl module)
   (Tested with linux-gpib-4.3.5 and Keysight 82357B on Ubuntu 22.10)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


You can test the library and specific programs without installation with commands like:

perl -I lib bin/gpib.pl -address 11 'id?'

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

If you intend to use a Prologix USB-GPIB or compatible controller, you
must install Device::Serial

If you intend to use a LinuxGpib interface device, you must first install linux-gpib and its LinuxGpib perl binding module
from https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-gpib
Follow the instructions in lib/Device/GPIB/Controllers/README.
  
This module obsoletes and replaces the earlier Device::GPIB::Prologix
module from the same author.
