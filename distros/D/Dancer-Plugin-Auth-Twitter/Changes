Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-Auth-Twitter

0.08 2018-08-07
[ BUG FIXES ]
 - This wasn't working for ages because of Twitter API changes which
   Net::Twitter::Lite wasn't updated for - so now use the new
   Twitter::API which works.  (Side effect: we now require Perl 5.14, because
   Twitter::API does.) (GH #19, Breno G. de Oliveira (GARU) - thanks!)
