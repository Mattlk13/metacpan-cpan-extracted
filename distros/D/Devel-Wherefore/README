NAME
    Devel::Wherefore - Where the heck did these subroutines come from?

SYNOPSIS
      $ perl -d:Wherefore myscript.pl

    will dump symbols in main from myscript.pl

      $ perl -d:Wherefore=App::opan $(which opan)

    will dump symbols from package App::opan in the installed opan script

      $ perl -d:Wherefore lib/Foo/Bar.pm

    will dump symbols from package Foo::Bar (we guess the package by
    stripping either 'lib' or any @INC entry off the front, then assuming
    the package name is Foo::Bar for Foo/Bar.pm etc). Which means this also
    works:

      $ perl -d:Wherefore $(perldoc -lm App::Cpan)

    Note that this code uses "B::minus_c" to only compile the script so you
    don't have to worry about it executing - does mean we'll miss runtime
    require and import but hey, trade-offs.
