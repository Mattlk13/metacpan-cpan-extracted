NAME
    Data::Dmp::Prune - Dump Perl data structures as Perl code, prune some
    branches

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.240.0 of Data::Dmp::Prune (from Perl
    distribution Data-Dmp-Prune), released on 2020-10-04.

SYNOPSIS
    In Perl code:

     use Data::Dmp; # exports dd() and dmp()
     {
         local $Data::Dmp::Prune::OPT_PRUNE = ['/3', '/b', '/c/foo'];
         dd [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; # prints "[1,2,3,'PRUNED',5]"
         $a = dmp({a => 1, b => 2, c => {foo=>1, bar=>2}}); # -> "{a=>1,c=>{bar=>2}}"
     }

    On the command line:

     % DATA_DMP_PRUNE_OPT_PRUNE="/3 /b /c/foo" yourscript.pl ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a fork of Data::Dmp 0.240, with an option to prune some data
    structure branches.

VARIABLES
    These section only lists variables specific to Data::Dmp::Prune. For
    other variables see Data::Dmp's documentation.

  $Data::Dmp::Prune::OPT_PRUNE
    Array reference containing data structure paths to prune. Data structure
    path uses "/" as path separator so currently you cannot prune hash key
    that contains "/". Each path element represents hash key name or array
    element index.

FUNCTIONS
    See Data::Dmp's documentation for more details on each function.

  dd
  dmp
  dd_ellipsis
  dmp_ellipsis
ENVIRONMENT
  DATA_DMP_PRUNE_OPT_PRUNE
    Provide default for "$Data::Dmp::Prune::OPT_PRUNE". Value is a string
    that will be split on whitespace to become array reference, so currently
    you cannot prune hash key that contains whitespace (as well as "/").
