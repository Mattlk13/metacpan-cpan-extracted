NAME
    Device::Chip::Adapter::Gpiod - Device::Chip::Adapter implementation for
    Linux GPIO character devices

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows Device::Chip to use Linux GPIO character devices
    through the libgpiod library.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
      my $adapter = Device::Chip::Adapter::Gpiod->new(device => "gpiochip0");

    Returns a new "Device::Chip::Adapter::Gpiod" instance. The "device"
    argument indicates the GPIO chip to use. It is passed to
    "gpiod_chip_open_lookup()", which takes either a device node name, full
    path, or chip number. For example, it is possible to use either
    "gpiochip2", "/dev/gpiochip2", or 2 to open the same device.

PROTOCOLS
    Only the "GPIO" protocol is supported:

      my $protocol = $adapter->make_protocol('GPIO');

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    The "meta_gpios" method is not yet supported.

    The "tris_gpios" method is not yet supported.

    Libgpiod supports passing a "consumer" string when GPIO lines are opened
    that can identify the application using them. This is currently always
    set to "Device::Chip".
