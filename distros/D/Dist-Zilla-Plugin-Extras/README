SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

      [Extras]
      foo = 1
      bar = 2
    
      [Extras / Baz]
      qux = 1
      quux = 2

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin lets you specify extra parameters in your dist.ini under
    the [Extras] section. Other than that it does nothing. It basically
    serves as "bags" to put parameters in.

    One use-case of this is to put template variables in your dist.ini,
    e.g.:

     [Extras]
     name1 = value1
     name2 = value2

    The parameters are available for other plugins through $zilla
    (Dist::Zilla object), e.g.:

     my $extras_plugin = grep { $_->plugin_name eq 'Extras' } $zilla->plugins;
     my $name1 = $extras_plugin->params->{name1}; # -> "value1"

    Another use-case of this is to put stuffs to be processed by other
    software aside from Dist::Zilla (e.g. see App::LintPrereqs).
