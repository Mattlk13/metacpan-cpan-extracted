NAME

    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::OpusVL - Standard behaviour for
    OpusVL modules

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

        [@Author::OpusVL]
        mcpani_host = some.cpan.host

DESCRIPTION

    This generally implements the workflow that OpusVL modules will use.

    It is roughly equivalent to:

      [Git::GatherDir]
      [@Starter]
      ; ...but without GatherDir and UploadToCPAN or TestRelease
    
      [Prereqs::FromCPANfile]
      [CheckChangesHasContent]
      [RewriteVersion]
      [NextRelease]
      [Repository]
      [PodWeaver]
      finder = :InstallModules
      
      [Git::Commit / CommitGeneratedFiles]
      allow_dirty = dist.ini
      allow_dirty = Changes 
      allow_dirty = cpanfile 
      allow_dirty = LICENSE
      [ExecDir]
      dir = script
    
      [Git::Tag]
      [BumpVersionAfterRelease]
      [Git::Commit / CommitVersionBump]
      allow_dirty_match = ^lib/
      commit_msg = "Bumped version number"
    
      [Git::Push]
      [CPAN::Mini::Inject::REST]
    
      [Prereqs / TestMoreWithSubtests]
      -phase = test
      -type  = requires
      Test::More = 0.96

    Your module files should contain:

      # ABSTRACT: frobnicates the whirligigs
    
      our $VERSION = '0.001';

    For PodWeaver (the ABSTRACT) and RewriteVersion (the $VERSION).

    Your script files should additionally contain

      # PODNAME: myscript

    Modules and scripts should thus not contain a NAME section in their
    POD.

TODO

    The two modules in this distribution need to be split into roles so we
    don't have to provide dummy data for mcpani_host in the ToCPAN version
    that doesn't use it.
