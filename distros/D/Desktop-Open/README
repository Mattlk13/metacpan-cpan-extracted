NAME
    Desktop::Open - Open a file or URL in the user's preferred application

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Desktop::Open (from Perl
    distribution Desktop-Open), released on 2023-10-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use Desktop::Open qw(open_desktop);
     my $ok = open_desktop($path_or_url);
     # !defined($ok);       no recognized command found
     # $ok == 0;            command found and executed
     # $ok != 0;            command found, error while executing

DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to open specified file or URL in the user's preferred
    application. Here's how it does it.

    1. If on Windows, use "start". If on other OS, use "xdg-open" if
    available.

    2. If #1 fails, resort to using Browser::Open's "open_browser". Return
    its return value. An exception is if #1 fails with "file/URL does not
    exist" error, in which case we give up immediately.

    TODO: On OSX, use "openit". Any taker?

FUNCTIONS
  open_desktop
ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_DESKTOP_OPEN_PROGRAM
    String. Override which program to use for opening the progrm instead of
    xdg-open. Note that the program is not checked for existence, nor the
    result is checked for success. No other program will be tried.

  PERL_DESKTOP_OPEN_USE_BROWSER
    Integer. If set to 1, then will just use Browser::Open directly instead
    of xdg-open program.

SEE ALSO
    Browser::Open, on which our module is modelled upon.

    Open::This also tries to do "The Right Thing" when opening files, but
    it's heavily towards text editor and git/GitHub.

    App::Open and its CLI openit also attempt to open file using appropriate
    file. It requires setting up a configuration file to run.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
