NAME
    Desktop::Open - Open a file or URL in the user's preferred application

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Desktop::Open (from Perl
    distribution Desktop-Open), released on 2021-07-05.

SYNOPSIS
     use Desktop::Open qw(open_desktop);
     my $ok = open_desktop($path_or_url);
     # !defined($ok);       no recognized command found
     # $ok == 0;            command found and executed
     # $ok != 0;            command found, error while executing

DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to open specified file or URL in the user's preferred
    application. Here's how it does it.

    1. If on Windows, use "start". If on other OS, use "xdg-open" if
    available.

    2. If #1 fails, resort to using Browser::Open's "open_browser". Return
    its return value. An exception is if #1 fails with "file/URL does not
    exist" error, in which case we give up immediately.

    TODO: On OSX, use "openit". Any taker?

SEE ALSO
    Browser::Open, on which our module is modelled upon.

    Open::This also tries to do "The Right Thing" when opening files, but
    it's heavily towards text editor and git/GitHub.

    App::Open and its CLI openit also attempt to open file using appropriate
    file. It requires setting up a configuration file to run.
