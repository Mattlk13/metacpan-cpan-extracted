NAME
    DBIx::Connect::Any - Connect to DBI using DBIx::Connect::*

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of DBIx::Connect::Any (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-Connect-Any), released on 2018-12-03.

SYNOPSIS
    Instead of:

     use DBI;
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", ...);

    you can now do:

     use DBIx::Connect::Any;
     my $dbh = DBIx::Connect::Any->connect("dbi:mysql:database=mydb", ...);

    and connecting will be handled by DBIx::Connect::MySQL.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a wrapper for DBIx::Connect::MySQL and other future
    DBIx::Connect::*.

METHODS
  connect($dsn, $user, $pass, ...)
    Currently will pass to DBI::Connect::MySQL if $dsn starts with
    "DBI:mysql:". Otherwise will pass to "DBI->connect".
