NAME
    Data::Dump::Color - Like Data::Dump, but with color

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.250 of Data::Dump::Color (from Perl
    distribution Data-Dump-Color), released on 2025-02-21.

SYNOPSIS
    Use it like you would Data::Dump, e.g.:

     use Data::Dump::Color; dd localtime;

DESCRIPTION
    Sample screenshots:

    This module aims to be a drop-in replacement for Data::Dump. It adds
    colors to dumps. It also adds various visual aids in the comments, e.g.
    array/hash index, depth indicator, and so on.

    For more information, see Data::Dump. This documentation explains what's
    different between this module and Data::Dump.

RESULTS
    By default Data::Dump::Color shows array index or hash pair sequence in
    comments for visual aid, e.g.:

     [
       "this",      # [0]
       "is",        # [1]
       "a",         # [2]
       "5-element", # [3]
       "array",     # [4]
       {
         0  => "with",  # .{0}
         1  => "an",    # .{1}
         2  => "extra", # .{2}
         3  => "hash",  # .{3}
         4  => "at",    # .{4}
         5  => "the",   # .{5}
         16 => "end",   # .{6}
       },           # [5]
     ]

    "[]" and "{}" brackets will indicate whether they are indexes to an
    array or a hash. The dot prefixes will mark depth level.

    To turn this off, set $INDEX to 0:

     [
       "this",
       "is",
       "a",
       "5-element",
       "array",
       {
         0  => "with",
         1  => "an",
         2  => "extra",
         3  => "hash",
         4  => "at",
         5  => "the",
         16 => "end",
       },
     ]

VARIABLES
    "$Data::Dump::*" package variables from Data::Dump, like
    $Data::Dump::TRY_BASE64, etc are now in the "Data::Dump::Color"
    namespace, e.g. $Data::Dump::Color::TRY_BASE64, etc.

    Additional variables include:

    $COLOR => BOOL (default: undef)
        Whether to force-enable or disable color. If unset, color output
        will be determined from "NO_COLOR", "COLOR" environment variables,
        or whether running in interactive terminal (when "-t STDOUT" is
        true).

    $COLOR_THEME => str
        Select a color theme, which is a module under
        "ColorTheme::Data::Dump::Color::" or "ColorTheme::" namespace
        (with/without the namespace prefix). For example: "Default256",
        "Bright".

    $INDEX => BOOL (default: 1)
        Whether to add array/hash index visual aid.

    $LENTHRESHOLD => int (default: 500)
        Add string length visual aid for hash key/hash value/array element
        if length is at least this value.

FUNCTIONS
    Only "dd" and "ddx" are exported by default.

  dd
  ddx
  dump
FAQ
  How do I turn off index comments?
    Set $Data::Dump::Color::INDEX to 0.

  How do I turn off colors?
    Well, colors is sort of the point of this module. But if you want to
    turn it off, you can set environment COLOR to 0, or
    $Data::Dump::Color::COLOR to 0.

  How do I customize colors?
    Create a color theme and give it a name under
    "ColorTheme::Data::Dump::Color::*". See an existing color theme for
    example, e.g. ColorTheme::Data::Dump::Color::Default256.

ENVIRONMENT
  DATA_DUMP_COLOR_THEME
    Set color theme. Name will be searched under
    "ColorTheme::Data::Dump::Color::*" or "ColorTheme::*".

  NO_COLOR
    Can be used to disable color. Takes precedence over the "COLOR"
    environment. See <https://no-color.org> for more details.

  COLOR
    If set, then will force color output on or off. By default, will only
    output color when in interactive terminal. This is consulted when $COLOR
    is not set.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
