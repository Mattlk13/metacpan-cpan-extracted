NAME
    Data::Sah::Tiny - Validate Sah schemas with as little code as possible

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.000 of Data::Sah::Tiny (from Perl
    distribution Data-Sah-Tiny), released on 2020-05-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Sah::Tiny qw(normalize_schema gen_validator);

     my $v = gen_validator([int => min=>1]);
     say $v->(0); # false
     say $v->(2); # true

DESCRIPTION
    Early release. Not all types and clauses are supported.

    This is a tiny alternative to Data::Sah, with fewer dependencies and
    much faster compilation speed. But it supports only a subset of
    Data::Sah's features.

PERFORMANCE NOTES
    Validator generation is several times faster than Data::Sah, so
    Params::Sah with Data::Sah::Tiny backend is in the same order of
    magnitude with other validator generators like Type::Params and
    Params::ValidationCompiler. See Bencher::Scenarios::ParamsSah.

FUNCTIONS
  gen_validator($sch[, \%opts ]) => code|str
    See Data::Sah's documentation. Supported options:

    *   schema_is_normalized

        Bool.

    *   return_type

        Str. Only "bool_valid" and "bool_valid+val" are supported.

    *   data_term

        Str. Defaults to $_[0].

    *   source

        Bool. Set to 1 to return source code instead of compiled coderef.

    *   hash*

        Bool. If set to 1 will return compilation result details.

  normalize_schema
    See Data::Sah::Normalize's documentation.
