NAME
    DBIx::FunctionalAPI - Some functions to expose your database as an API

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.09 of DBIx::FunctionalAPI (from Perl
    distribution DBIx-FunctionalAPI), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: EARLY RELEASE AND MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITIES

    This module provides a set of functions to get information and modify
    your DBI database. The functions are suitable in RPC-style or stateless
    client/server (like HTTP) API.

    Every function accepts "dbh" argument, but for convenience database
    handle can also be set via the $dbh package variable.

FUNCTIONS
  list_columns
    Usage:

     list_columns(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dbh => *obj*

        Database handle.

    *   detail => *bool*

        Whether to return detailed records instead of just items/strings.

    *   table* => *str*

        Table name.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
