=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::regenerate - Write content into your source tree from your release staging

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Have approprite dist.ini
  dzil regenerate  # Source tree updated!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Dist::Zilla::App::Command::regenerate> provides a C<regenerate> command to C<Dist::Zilla>
that allows some simple tooling to update your source tree when you choose to.

This works by producing a new synthetic target like the C<release> target, which happens
after the C<build> stage, but does not produce a release.

In conjunction with appropriate C<plugins> performing
L<< C<-Regenerator>|Dist::Zilla::Role::Regenerator >>, This means that:

=over 4

=item * You won't be frustrated with C<dzil build> constantly tweaking your source tree

=item * You won't be forced to ship a release just to update the state of some files that are generated
by plugins

=item * You won't even have to update your source tree B<ever> if you don't want to.

=back

When calling C<dzil regenerate>, a full copy of the distribution is built in a temporary directory
like it does when you call C<dzil test>.

Then after C<dzil regenerate> has written your built distribution out to the temporary directory,
any C<plugin>'s that perform the C<-Regenerator> role are called and told where your source tree is,
and where the build tree is, and they are expected to do the required work.

In effect, C<dzil regenerate> is a lot like:

  dzil build --not && \
    DO_STUFF_WITH .build/latest/  && \
    MAYBECOPY .build/latest/stuff ./stuff

Where those last 2 lines are done with C<plugins>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item * L<< C<dzil update>|Dist::Zilla::App::Command::update >>

This command invokes only the C<dzil build> parts of the equation and rely C<dzil build>
itself doing your source tree modification.

A goal of C<dzil regenerate> is to avoid C<dzil build> doing source tree modification.
