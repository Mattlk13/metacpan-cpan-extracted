Devel-ModuleBreaker
-------------------

Extensions to the Perl debugger that make it easy
to set breakpoints over all subroutines in a
namespace, in a source file, or in the collection
of all known subs simultaneously.

The distribution contains three mutually incompatible
packages,  Devel::ModuleBreaker, Devel::FileBreaker,
and Devel::SubBreaker. To use these modules,
invoke perl with the appropraite -d:xxxBreaker argument.

Devel::ModuleBreaker  puts a breakpoint at the start
of every subroutine in one or more specified namespaces

    $ perl -d:ModuleBreaker=module1,module2 script_to_debug.pl

Devel::FileBreaker  puts a breakpoint at the start of
every subroutine in source files that match any of the
given regular expressions

    $ perl -d:FileBreaker=file1,file2 script_to_debug.pl

Devel::SubBreaker  puts a breakpoint at the start of
every subroutine whose fully qualified subroutine name
matches any of the given regular expressions

    $ perl -d:SubBreaker=pattern1,pattern2 script_to_debug.pl

After setting its breakpoints, each of these packages
then turns over control to the regular perl debugger.

The modules in this distribution respect the PERL5DBX environment
variable for further customizing the debugger

    $ export PERL5DBX='BEGIN{require"my_debugger.pl"}'
    $ perl -d:SubBreaker=pattern3,pattern4 my_script.pl
