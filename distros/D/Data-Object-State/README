NAME

    Data::Object::State

ABSTRACT

    Singleton Builder for Perl 5

SYNOPSIS

      package Example;
    
      use Data::Object::State;
    
      has data => (
        is => 'ro'
      );
    
      package main;
    
      my $example = Example->new;

DESCRIPTION

    This package provides an abstract base class for creating singleton
    classes. This package is derived from Moo and makes consumers Moo
    classes (with all that that entails). This package also injects a BUILD
    method which is responsible for hooking into the build process and
    returning the appropriate state.

METHODS

    This package implements the following methods:

 new

      renew() : Object

    The new method sets the internal state and returns a new class
    instance. Subsequent calls to new will return the same instance as was
    previously returned.

    new example #1

        package Example::New;
      
        use Data::Object::State;
      
        has data => (
          is => 'ro'
        );
      
        my $example1 = Example::New->new(data => 'a');
        my $example2 = Example::New->new(data => 'b');
      
        [$example1, $example2]

 renew

      renew() : Object

    The renew method resets the internal state and returns a new class
    instance. Each call to renew will discard the previous state, then
    reconstruct and stash the new state as requested.

    renew example #1

        package Example::Renew;
      
        use Data::Object::State;
      
        has data => (
          is => 'ro'
        );
      
        my $example1 = Example::Renew->new(data => 'a');
        my $example2 = $example1->renew(data => 'b');
        my $example3 = Example::Renew->new(data => 'c');
      
        [$example1, $example2, $example3]
