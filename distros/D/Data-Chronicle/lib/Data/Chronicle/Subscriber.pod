=head1 NAME

Data::Chronicle::Subscriber - Provides callback subscriptions to an efficient data storage for volatile and time-based data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains helper methods which can be used to store and retrieve information
on an efficient storage with below properties:

=over 4

=item B<Timeliness>

It is assumed that data to be stored are time-based meaning they change over time and the latest version is most important for us.

=item B<Efficient>

The module uses Redis cache to provide efficient data storage and retrieval.

=item B<Persistent>

In addition to caching every incoming data, it is also stored in PostgreSQL for future retrieval.

=item B<Transparent>

This modules hides all the internal details including distribution, caching, and database structure from the developer. He only needs to call a method
to save data and another method to retrieve it. All the underlying complexities are handled by the module.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 my $d = get_some_log_data();

 my $chronicle_w = Data::Chronicle::Writer->new(
    cache_writer   => $writer,
    dbic           => $dbic,
    ttl            => 86400,
    publish_on_set => 1);

 my $chronicle_s = Data::Chronicle::Subscriber->new(
    cache_reader => $subscriber);

 #subscribe to changes to syslog
 $chronicle_s->subscribe("log_files", "syslog", sub { print 'Hello World' });

 #store data into Chronicle - each time we call `set` it will also call
 #the stored subroutine
 $chronicle_w->set("log_files", "syslog", $d);

 #unsubscribe to changes to syslog
 $chronicle_s->unsubscribe("log_files", "syslog");

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cache_subscriber

cache_subscriber should be an instance of L<RedisDB>.

=head2 subscribe

Example:

    $chronicle_writer->subscribe("category1", "name1", $code_ref);

=head2 unsubscribe

Example:

    $chronicle_writer->unsubscribe("category1", "name1");
