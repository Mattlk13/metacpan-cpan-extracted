=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Clean - Delete current per-dist share dir before install

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.05 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Clean (from Perl distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ShareDir-Clean), released on 2016-06-08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your dist.ini:

 [ShareDir]

 [ShareDir::Clean]
 ;dir=share

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING: This plugin will add a code in Makefile.PL to *DELETE* (rm -rf) a
directory in the installation target, which might have severe consequences.
Don't use this plugin unless you know exactly what you're doing.>

This plugin is an alternative to using L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball>
(please read the documentation of that module first for the rationale). With
this plugin, you can keep using L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir>, but eliminate
the problem of lingering old files.

What this plugin does is delete the current per-dist share directory in the
installation target before installation.

Some caveats/current limitations:

=over

=item * Only Makefile.PL is currently supported.

=item * Windows (or other non-POSIX) installation target system is not yet tested.

=back

All in all, I think Yanick's ShareDir::Tarball plugin is a slightly more elegant
hack and I use it. But when it's more appropriate, I use this plugin too.

=for Pod::Coverage ^(setup_installer)$

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 dir => str (default: share)

Name of shared directory.
