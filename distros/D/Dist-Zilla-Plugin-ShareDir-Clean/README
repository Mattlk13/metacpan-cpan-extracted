SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

     [ShareDir]
    
     [ShareDir::Clean]
     ;dir=share

DESCRIPTION

    WARNING: This plugin will add a code in Makefile.PL to *DELETE* (rm
    -rf) a directory in the installation target, which might have severe
    consequences. Don't use this plugin unless you know exactly what you're
    doing.

    This plugin is an alternative to using
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball (please read the documentation
    of that module first for the rationale). With this plugin, you can keep
    using Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir, but eliminate the problem of
    lingering old files.

    What this plugin does is delete the current per-dist share directory in
    the installation target before installation.

    Some caveats/current limitations:

      * Only Makefile.PL is currently supported.

      * Windows (or other non-POSIX) installation target system is not yet
      tested.

    All in all, I think Yanick's ShareDir::Tarball plugin is a slightly
    more elegant hack and I use it. But when it's more appropriate, I use
    this plugin too.

CONFIGURATION

 dir => str (default: share)

    Name of shared directory.
