NAME
    Data::Transmute::Rules::TreeNodeHash::StringifyChildren - Stringify
    children attributes in tree nodes to make the tree more dump-friendly

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Data::Transmute::Rules::TreeNodeHash::StringifyChildren (from Perl
    distribution Data-Transmute-Rules-TreeNodeHash-StringifyChildren),
    released on 2020-02-13.

DESCRIPTION
    Tree is an interlinked data structure, where parent links to children
    and the children link back to their parents. This makes the dump of a
    tree node unwieldy; if you dump a node, you will end up dumping the
    whole tree.

    This rule walks the tree structure and replaces the value of hash key
    'children' to its stringified value. This effectively "clips" the
    children when dumping, which is sometimes desirable when debugging.
