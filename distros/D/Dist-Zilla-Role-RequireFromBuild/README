NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild - Role to require() from build files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Role-RequireFromBuild), released on 2022-02-19.

SYNOPSIS
    In your plugin's preamble, include the role:

     with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild';

    Then in your plugin subroutine, e.g. "munge_files()":

     $self->require_from_build("Foo/Bar.pm");
     $self->require_from_build("Baz::Quux");

DESCRIPTION
    Since build files are not necessarily on-disk files, but might also be
    in-memory files or files with munged content, we cannot use "require()"
    directly. "require_from_build()" is like Perl's "require()" except it
    looks for files not from @INC but from build files
    "$self->zilla->files". It searches libraries in "lib/" and ".".

    "$self->require_from_build("Foo/Bar.pm")" or
    "$self->require_from_build("Foo::Bar")" is a convenient shortcut for
    something like:

     return if exists $INC{"Foo/Bar.pm"};

     my @files = grep { $_->name eq "lib/Foo/Bar.pm" } @{ $self->zilla->files };
     @files    = grep { $_->name eq "Foo/Bar.pm" }     @{ $self->zilla->files } unless @files;
     die "Can't find Foo/Bar.pm in lib/ or ./ in build files" unless @files;

     eval $files[0]->encoded_content;
     die if $@;

     $INC{"Foo/Bar.pm"} = "(set by Dist::Zilla::Role::RequireFromBuild, loaded from build file)";

PROVIDED METHODS
  $obj->require_from_build( [ \%opts , ] $file)
    Known options:

    *   reload

        Bool. Optional, default false. If set to true, will reload the
        module even if it's already loaded.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
