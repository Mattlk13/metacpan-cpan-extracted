NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Inline - Create test files from inline tests
    in POD sections

VERSION

    version 0.011005

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

            [Test::Inline]

    In your module:

            # My/AddressRange.pm
    
            =begin testing
    
            use Test::Exception;
            dies_ok {
                    My::AddressRange->list_from_range('10.2.3.A', '10.2.3.5')
            } "list_from_range() complains about invalid address";
    
            =end testing
            
            =cut
            
            sub list_from_range {
                    # ...
            }

    This will result in a file t/inline-tests/my_addressrange.t in your
    distribution.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin integrates Test::Inline into Dist::Zilla.

    It scans all non-binary files in the lib path of your distribution for
    inline tests in POD sections that are embedded between the keywords

            =begin testing
            ...
            =end testing

    These tests are then exported into t/inline-tests/*.t files when
    Dist::Zilla builds your module. Multiple of test sections may be
    specified within one file.

    Please note that this plugin (in contrast to pure Test::Inline) can
    also handle Moops-like class and role definitions.

 Files to be scanned for inline tests

    Only files already gathered by previous file gatherer plugins are
    scanned. In other words: tests will not be extracted for files which
    have been excluded.

    Example:

            [GatherDir]
            exclude_match = Hidden\.pm
            [Test::Inline] 

    This will lead to Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Inline ignoring Hidden.pm.

METHODS

 gather_files

    Required by role Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer.

    Searches for inline test code in POD sections using Test::Inline,
    creates in-memory test files and passes them to Dist::Zilla.

 register_prereqs

    Required by role Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource.

    Adds Test::More to the list of prerequisites (as Test::Inline inserts
    use Test::More;) for the distribution that uses this plugin.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    The code of this Dist::Zilla file gatherer plugin is based on
    https://github.com/moose/moose/blob/master/inc/ExtractInlineTests.pm.

      but left the honor of making a plugin out of it to me ;-)
