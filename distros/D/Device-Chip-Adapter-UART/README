NAME

    Device::Chip::Adapter::UART - a Device::Chip::Adapter implementation
    for serial devices

DESCRIPTION

    This class implements the Device::Chip::Adapter interface around a
    regular serial port, such as a USB UART adapter, allowing an instance
    of a Device::Chip driver to communicate with actual chip hardware using
    this adapter.

    At present, this adapter only provides the GPIO protocol as a wrapper
    around the modem control and handshaking lines. A future version will
    also provide access to the actual transmit and receive data, once a
    suitable interface is designed.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

       $adapter = Device::Chip::Adapter::UART->new( %args )

    Returns a new instance of a Device::Chip::Adapter::UART.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    dev => STRING

      Path to the device node representing the UART; usually something like
      /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0.

PROTOCOLS

    The following Device::Chip::Adapter protocol types are supported

      * GPIO
