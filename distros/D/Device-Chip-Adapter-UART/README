NAME

    Device::Chip::Adapter::UART - a Device::Chip::Adapter implementation
    for serial devices

DESCRIPTION

    This class implements the Device::Chip::Adapter interface around a
    regular serial port, such as a USB UART adapter, allowing an instance
    of a Device::Chip driver to communicate with actual chip hardware using
    this adapter.

    This adapter provides both the GPIO and UART protocols. The GPIO
    protocol wraps the modem control and handshaking lines. The UART
    protocol adds access to the transmit and receive lines by adding the
    "write" and "read" methods.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

       $adapter = Device::Chip::Adapter::UART->new( %args )

    Returns a new instance of a Device::Chip::Adapter::UART.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    dev => STRING

      Path to the device node representing the UART; usually something like
      /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0.

PROTOCOLS

    The following Device::Chip::Adapter protocol types are supported

      * GPIO
