DWIM::Block version 0.000002

 This module makes it easy to build code that sends a request to the OpenAI
 API and then returns the response. Instead of writing all the infrastructure
 code to accomplish that, you just write:

    DWIM { Your $interpolated request here }

 and your request is sent off to ChatGPT via the AI::Chat module.
 The DWIM block returns ChatGPT's response.
