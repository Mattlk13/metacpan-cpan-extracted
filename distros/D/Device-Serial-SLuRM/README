NAME

    Device::Serial::SLuRM - communicate the SLµRM protocol over a serial
    port

SYNOPSIS

       use v5.36;
       use Device::Serial::SLuRM;
    
       my $slurm = Device::Serial::SLuRM->new(
          dev  => "/dev/ttyUSB0",
          baud => 19200,
       );
    
       $slurm->run(
          on_notify => sub ($payload) {
             printf "NOTIFY: %v02X\n", $payload;
          }
       )->await;

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Future::IO-based interface for communicating
    with a peer device on a serial port (or similar device handle) which
    talks the SLµRM messaging protocol. It supports sending and receiving
    of NOTIFY packets, and sending of REQUEST packets that receive a
    RESPONSE.

    It currently does not support receiving REQUESTs, though this could be
    added relatively easily.

    Optionally, this module supports being the controller for a multi-drop
    ("MSLµRM") bus. See the Device::Serial::MSLuRM subclass.

 SLµRM

    SLµRM ("Serial Link Microcontroller Reliable Messaging") is a simple
    bidirectional communication protocol for adding reliable message
    framing and request/response semantics to byte-based data links (such
    as asynchronous serial ports), which may themselves be somewhat
    unreliable. SLµRM can tolerate bytes arriving corrupted or going
    missing altogether, or additional noise bytes being received, while
    still maintaining a reliable bidirectional flow of messages. There are
    two main kinds of message flows - NOTIFYs and REQUESTs. In all cases,
    packet payloads can be of a variable length (including zero bytes), and
    the protocol itself does not put semantic meaning on those bytes - they
    are free for the application to use as required.

    A NOTIFY message is a simple notification from one peer to the other,
    that does not yield a response.

    A REQUEST message carries typically some sort of command instruction,
    to which the peer should respond with a RESPONSE or ERR packet. Replies
    to a REQUEST message do not have to be sent sequentially.

    The doc/ directory of this distribution contains more detailed protocol
    documentation which may be useful for writing other implementations.

    The contrib/ directory of this distribution contains a reference
    implementation in C for 8-bit microcontrollers, such as AVR ATtiny and
    ATmega chips.

 Metrics

    If Metrics::Any is available, this module additionally provides metrics
    under the namespace prefix of slurm. The following metrics are
    provided:

    discards

      An unlabelled counter tracking the number of times a received packet
      is discarded due to failing CRC check.

    packets

      A counter, labelled by direction and packet type, tracking the number
      of packets sent and received of each type.

    request_success_attempts

      A distribution that tracks how many attempts it took to get a
      response to each request.

    request_duration

      A timer that tracks how long it took to get a response to each
      request.

    retransmits

      An unlabelled counter tracking the number of times a (REQUEST) packet
      had to be retransmitted after the initial one timed out.

    serial_bytes

      A counter, labelled by direction, tracking the number of bytes sent
      and received directly over the serial port. The rate of this can be
      used to calculate overall serial link utilisation.

    timeouts

      An unlabelled counter tracking the number of times a request
      transaction was abandoned entirely due to a timeout. This does not
      count transactions that eventually succeeded after intermediate
      timeouts and retransmissions.

PARAMETERS

 dev

       dev => PATH

    Path to the /dev/... device node representing the serial port used for
    this communication. This will be opened via IO::Termios and configured
    into the appropriate mode and baud rate.

 baud

       baud => NUM

    Optional baud rate to set for communication when opening a device node.

    SLµRM does not specify a particular rate, but a default value of 115.2k
    will apply if left unspecified.

 fh

       fh => IO

    An IO handle directly to the the serial port device to be used for
    reading and writing. It will be assumed to be set up correctly; no
    further setup will be performed.

    Either dev or fh are required.

 retransmit_delay

       retransmit_delay => NUM

    Optional delay in seconds to wait after a non-response of a REQUEST
    packet before sending it again. A default of 50msec (0.05) will apply
    if not specified.

    Applications that transfer large amounts of data over slow links, or
    for which responding to a command may take a long time, should increase
    this value.

 retransmit_count

       retransmit_count => NUM

    Optional number of additional attempts to try sending REQUEST packets
    before giving up entirely. A default of 2 will apply if not specified
    (thus each request method will make up to 3 attempts).

METHODS

 recv_packet

       ( $pktctrl, $payload ) = await $slurm->recv_packet;

    Waits for and returns the next packet to be received from the serial
    port.

 run

       $run_f = $slurm->run( %args );

    Starts the receiver run-loop, which can be used to wait for incoming
    NOTIFY packets. This method returns a future, but the returned future
    will not complete in normal circumstances. It will remain pending while
    the run-loop is running. If an unrecoverable error happens (such as an
    IO error on the underlying serial port device) then this future will
    fail.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    on_notify => CODE

         $on_notify->( $payload )

      Optional. Invoked on receipt of a NOTIFY packet.

    Will automatically "reset" first if required.

 stop

       $slurm->stop;

    Stops the receiver run-loop, if running, causing its future to be
    cancelled.

    It is not an error to call this method if the run loop is not running.

 send_packet

       await $slurm->send_packet( $pktctrl, $payload );

    Sends a packet to the serial port.

 reset

       $slurm->reset;

    Resets the transmitter sequence number and sends a META-RESET packet.

    It is not normally required to explicitly call this, as the first call
    to "run", "send_notify" or "request" will do it if required.

 send_notify

       await $slurm->send_notify( $payload );

    Sends a NOTIFY packet.

    Will automatically "reset" first if required.

 request

       $data_in = await $slurm->request( $data_out );

    Sends a REQUEST packet, and waits for a response to it.

    If the peer responds with an ERR packet, the returned future will fail
    with an error message, the category of slurm, and the payload body of
    the ERR packet in the message details:

       $f->fail( $message, slurm => $payload );

    If the peer does not respond at all and all retransmit attempts end in
    a timeout, the returned future will fail the same way but with undef as
    the message details:

       $f->fail( $message, slurm => undef );

    Will automatically "reset" first if required.
