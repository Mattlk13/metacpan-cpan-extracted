NAME

    Device::Chip::DS1307 - chip driver for a DS1307

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a Maxim
    Integrated DS1307 chip attached to a computer via an I²C adapter.

METHODS

    The following methods documented in an await expression return Future
    instances.

 read_FIELD

       $sec  = await $ds->read_seconds;
       $min  = await $ds->read_minutes;
       $hr   = await $ds->read_hours;
       $wday = await $ds->read_wday;
       $mday = await $ds->read_mday;
       $mon  = await $ds->read_month;
       $year = await $ds->read_year;

    Reads a timekeeping field and returns a decimal integer. The following
    fields are recognised:

    The hours field is always returned in 24-hour mode, even if the chip is
    in 12-hour ("AM/PM") mode.

 write_FIELD

       await $ds->write_seconds( $sec  );
       await $ds->write_minutes( $min  );
       await $ds->write_hours  ( $hr   );
       await $ds->write_wday   ( $wday );
       await $ds->write_mday   ( $mday );
       await $ds->write_month  ( $mon  );
       await $ds->write_year   ( $year );

    Writes a timekeeping field as a decimal integer. The following fields
    are recognised:

    The hours field is always written back in 24-hour mode.

 read_time

       @tm = await $ds->read_time;

    Returns a 7-element struct tm-compatible list of values by reading the
    timekeeping registers, suitable for passing to POSIX::mktime, etc...
    Note that the returned list does not contain the yday or is_dst fields.

    Because the DS1307 only stores a 2-digit year number, the year is
    presumed to be in the range 2000-2099.

    This method presumes POSIX-compatible semantics for the wday field
    stored on the chip; i.e. that 0 is Sunday.

    This method performs an atomic reading of all the timekeeping registers
    as a single I²C transaction, so is preferrable to invoking multiple
    calls to individual read methods.

 write_time

       await $ds->write_time( @tm );

    Writes the timekeeping registers from a 7-element struct tm-compatible
    list of values. This method ignores the yday and is_dst fields, if
    present.

    Because the DS1307 only stores a 2-digit year number, the year must be
    in the range 2000-2099 (i.e. numerical values of 100 to 199).

    This method performs an atomic writing of all the timekeeping registers
    as a single I²C transaction, so is preferrable to invoking multiple
    calls to individual write methods.
