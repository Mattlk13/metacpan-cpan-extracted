NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertDistFileLink - Insert links to distribution
    shared files into POD as HTML snippets

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertDistFileLink (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertDistFileLink), released on 2023-11-09.

SYNOPSIS
    In share, put some files e.g. foo.xlsx and share/img1.png.

    In dist.ini:

     [InsertDistFileLink]
     ;hosting=metacpan
     ;include_files=...
     ;exclude_files=...
     ;include_file_pattern=...
     ;exclude_file_pattern=...

    In lib/Qux.pm or script/quux:

     ...

     # FILE: share/foo.xlsx
     # FILE: share/

     ...

    After build, lib/Foo.pm will contain:

     ...

     =begin html

     <a href="https://st.aticpan.org/source/CPANID/Your-Dist-Name-0.123/share/foo.xlsx" />foo.xlsx</a><br />

     =end html

     =begin html

     <a href="https://st.aticpan.org/source/CPANID/Your-Dist-Name-0.123/share/images/img1.png">image/img1.png</a><br />

     =end html

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin finds "# FILE" directive in your POD/code and replace it
    with a POD containing HTML snippet to link to the file, using the
    selected hosting provider's URL scheme.

    Rationale: sometimes it's convenient to link to the distribution shared
    files in HTML documentation. In POD there's currently no mechanism to do
    this.

    The "#FILE" directive must occur at the beginning of line and must be
    followed by path to the image (relative to the distribution's root).

    Shared files deployed inside a tarball (such as one created using
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball) are not yet supported.

CONFIGURATION
  hosting => str (default: metacpan)
    Choose hosting provider. For available choicese, see
    Dist::Zilla::Role::GetDistFileURL.

  include_files => str+
  exclude_files => str+
  include_file_pattern => re
  exclude_file_pattern => re

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
