SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCodeOutput]
     ;make_verbatim=1

    In your POD:

     # CODE: require MyLib; MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");

DESCRIPTION

    This module finds # CODE: ... directives in your POD, evals the
    specified Perl code while capturing the output using Capture::Tiny's
    capture_merged (which means STDOUT and STDERR output are both
    captured), and insert the output to your POD as verbatim paragraph
    (indented with a whitespace), unless when make_verbatim is set to 0
    then it is inserted as-is. If eval fails ($@ is true), build will be
    aborted.

SEE ALSO

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult which is similar and uses the
    same # CODE directive, but instead of inserting output, will insert the
    result of the code (which can be a reference, in which case will be
    dumped using Data::Dump).
