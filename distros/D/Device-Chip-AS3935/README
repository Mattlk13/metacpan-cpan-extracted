NAME

    Device::Chip::AS3935 - chip driver for AS3935

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::AS3935;
       use Future::AsyncAwait;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::AS3935->new;
       await $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new );
    
       if( ( await $chip->read_int )->{INT_L} ) {
          printf "Lightning detected %dkm away\n", await $chip->read_distance;
       }

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communcation to an ams
    AS3935 lightning detector chip attached to a computer via an I²C
    adapter.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

METHODS

    The following methods documented in an await expression return Future
    instances.

 reset

       await $chip->reset;

    Sends a reset command to initialise the configuration back to defaults.

 calibrate_rco

       await $chip->calibrate_rco;

    Sends a calibrate command to request the chip perform its internal RC
    oscillator calibration.

 read_config

       $config = await $chip->read_config;

    Returns a HASH reference of the contents of configuration registers
    using fields named from the data sheet.

       AFE_GB       => 0 .. 31
       PWD          => "active" | "powerdown"
       NF_LEV       => 0 .. 7
       WDTH         => 0 .. 15
       CL_STAT      => bool
       MIN_NUM_LIGH => 1 | 5 | 9 | 16
       SREJ         => 0 .. 15
       LCO_FDIV     => 16 | 32 | 64 | 128
       MASK_DIST    => bool
       DISP_LCO     => bool
       DISP_SRCO    => bool
       DISP_TRCO    => bool
       TUN_CAP      => 0 .. 15

    Additionally, the following keys are provided calculated from those, as
    a convenience.

       afe        => "indoor" | "outdoor"
       noisefloor => int (in units of µVrms)

 change_config

       await $chip->change_config( %changes );

    Writes updates to the configuration registers.

 read_calib_status

       $status = await $chip->read_calib_status;

    Returns a 4-element HASH reference indicating the calibration status:

       TRCO_CALIB_DONE => bool
       TRCO_CALIB_NOK  => bool
       SRCO_CALIB_DONE => bool
       SRCO_CALIB_NOK  => bool

 read_int

       $ints = await $chip->read_int;

    Returns a 3-element HASH reference containing the three interrupt
    flags:

       INT_NH => bool
       INT_D  => bool
       INT_L  => bool

 read_distance

       $distance = await $chip->read_distance;

    Returns an integer giving the estimated lightning distance, in km, or
    undef if it is below the detection limit.
