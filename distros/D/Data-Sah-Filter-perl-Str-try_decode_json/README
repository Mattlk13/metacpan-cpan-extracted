NAME
    Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::try_decode_json - JSON-decode if we can,
    otherwise leave string as-is

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Data::Sah::Filter::perl::Str::try_decode_json (from Perl distribution
    Data-Sah-Filter-perl-Str-try_decode_json), released on 2020-02-11.

SYNOPSIS
    Use in Sah schema's "prefilters" (or "postfilters") clause:

     ["str","prefilters",["Str::try_decode_json"]]

DESCRIPTION
    This rule is sometimes convenient if you want to accept unquoted string
    or a data structure (encoded in JSON). This means, compared to just
    decoding from JSON, you don't have to always quote your string. But
    beware of traps like the bare values "null", "true", "false" becoming
    undef/1/0 in Perl instead of string literals, because they can be
    JSON-decoded.
