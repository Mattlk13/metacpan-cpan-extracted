NAME

    Device::Chip::TCS3472x - chip driver for TCS3472x-family

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::TCS3472x;
       use Future::AsyncAwait;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::TCS3472x->new;
       await $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new );
    
       # Power on and enable ADCs
       await $chip->change_config(
          PON => 1,
          AEN => 1,
       );
    
       # At default config, first sensor reading is available after
       # 620 msec
       sleep 0.620;
    
       my ( $clear, $red, $green, $blue ) = await $chip->read_crgb;
       print "Red=$red Green=$green Blue=$blue\n";

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communications to a TASOC
    Inc. TCS3472x-family RGB light sensor chip.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

MOUNT PARAMETERS

 led

    Optional name of the GPIO line attached to the LED control pin common
    to many breakout boards. This is used by the "set_led" method.

METHODS

    The following methods documented in an await expression return Future
    instances.

 read_id

       $id = await $chip->read_id;

    Returns a 2-character string from the ID register. The expected value
    will depend on the type of chip

       "44"  # TCS34721 or TCS34725
       "4D"  # TCS34723 or TCS34727

 read_config

       $config = await $chip->read_config;

    Returns a hash reference containing the current chip configuration.

       AEN   => bool
       AIEN  => bool
       AGAIN => 1 | 4 | 16 | 60
       APERS => "EVERY" | int
       ATIME => int
       PON   => bool
       WEN   => bool
       WLONG => bool
       WTIME => int

    The returned value also contains some lowercase-named synthesized
    fields, containing helper values derived from the chip config. These
    keys are not supported by "change_config".

       atime_cycles => int   # number of integration cycles implied by ATIME
       atime_msec   => num   # total integration time implied by ATIME
    
       wtime_cycles => int   # number of wait cycles implied by WTIME
       wtime_msec   => num   # total wait time implied by WTIME and WLONG

 change_config

       await $chip->change_config( %changes )

    Changes the configuration. Any field names not mentioned will be
    preserved at their existing values.

 read_crgb

       ( $clear, $red, $green, $blue ) = await $chip->read_crgb

    Returns the result of the most recent colour acquisition.

 set_led

       await $chip->set_led( $on );

    If the led mount parameter was specified, this method acts as a proxy
    for the named GPIO line, setting it high or low to control the LED.

    While not a feature of the TCS3472x sensor chip itself, this is common
    to many breakout boards, so is provided here as a convenience.
