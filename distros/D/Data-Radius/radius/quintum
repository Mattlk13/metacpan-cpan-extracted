VENDOR	Quintum	6618

#	Due to some bugofeature Quintum CMS for the PSTN->PSTN calls on the
#	originate/Telephony call leg does not provide correct value for the
#	NAS-Port-Name. Instead the value provided there is the same as
#	NAS-Port-Name on the answer/Telephony. And the name of the actual port
#	which is used to carry outgoing telephony call supposedly reported in
#	the magic attribute with code 231.
