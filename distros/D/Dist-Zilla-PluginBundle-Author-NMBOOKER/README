NAME

    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::NMBOOKER - Standard behaviour for
    NMBOOKER's modules

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

        [@Author::NMBOOKER]

DESCRIPTION

    This generally implements the workflow that NMBOOKER's modules will
    use.

    It is roughly equivalent to:

      [Git::GatherDir]
      [@Basic]
    
      [Prereqs::FromCPANfile]
      [AutoPrereqs]
      [ReadmeFromPod]
      [MetaConfig]
      [MetaJSON]
      [PodSyntaxTests]
      [Test::Compile]
      [Test::ReportPrereqs]
      [CheckChangesHasContent]
      [RewriteVersion]
      [NextRelease]
      [Repository]
      [PodWeaver]
      
      [Git::Commit / CommitGeneratedFiles]
      allow_dirty = dist.ini
      allow_dirty = Changes 
      allow_dirty = cpanfile 
      allow_dirty = LICENSE
    
      [Git::Tag]
      [BumpVersionAfterRelease]
      [Git::Commit / CommitVersionBump]
      allow_dirty_match = ^lib/
      commit_msg = "Bumped version number"
    
      [Git::Push]
    
      [Prereqs / TestMoreWithSubtests]
      -phase = test
      -type  = requires
      Test::More = 0.96
