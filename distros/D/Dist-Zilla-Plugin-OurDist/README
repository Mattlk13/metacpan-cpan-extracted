SYNOPSIS

    in dist.ini:

     [OurDist]

    in your modules/scripts:

     # DIST

    or

     our $DIST = 'Some-Dist'; # DIST

DESCRIPTION

    This module is like Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgDist except that it looks
    for comments # DIST and put the $DIST assignment there instead of
    adding another line. The principle is the same as in
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurVersion (instead of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion).

    Comment/directive below __DATA__ or __END__ will not be replaced.
