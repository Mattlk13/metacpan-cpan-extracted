SYNOPSIS

      use Digest::MurmurHash2::Neutral qw(murmur_hash2_neutral);
      murmur_hash2_neutral($data_to_hash);

    OR

      use Digest::MurmurHash2::Neutral;
      Digest::MurmurHash2::murmur_hash2_neutral($data_to_hash);

DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of the endian neutral MurmurHash2 algorithm
    by Austin Appleby. This module was originally written for ZipRecruiter
    <https://www.ziprecruiter.com/hiring/technology> using code from nginx
    <https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/42f1e1cb96b510d1fa1abad99a5294a37b750d99/src/core/ngx_murmurhash.c>.
    I used Digest::MurmurHash as a template.

WHY

    As stated above, this module is implemented to compatible with nginx's
    MurmurHash2 implementation, used in the split_clients directive.
    MurmurHash3 would be faster, but compatibility is the goal here.
