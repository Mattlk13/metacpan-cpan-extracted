NAME

    Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::AlienBuild - A minimal Dist::Zilla minting
    profile for Aliens

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

     dzil new -P AlienBuild Alien::libfoo

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Dist::Zilla minting profile for creating Alien distributions
    based on the Alien::Build framework. It uses a reasonable template and
    the [@Starter] or [@Starter::Git] bundle plus the [AlienBuild] plugin.

CAVEATS

    This module indirectly requires both Alien::FFI and Alien::Archive3. If
    you do not want to build them from source, or do not have internet
    access where the build is happening you will want to pre-install libffi
    and libarchive. On Debian based systems, you can do that with sudo
    apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libarchive-dev. Note
    that libarchive 3.2.0 is required for a system install so if you have
    an older Debian or Ubuntu system you should upgrade your operating
    system.
