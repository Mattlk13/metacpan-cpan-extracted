SYNOPSIS

    In share/images, put some images e.g. img1.jpg and img2.png.

    In dist.ini:

     [InsertDistImages]
     ;hosting=metacpan
     ;include_files=...
     ;exclude_files=...
     ;include_file_pattern=...
     ;exclude_file_pattern=...

    In lib/Foo.pm or bin/bar:

     ...
    
     # IMAGE: share/images/img1.jpg
     # IMAGE: share/images/img2.png
    
     ...

    After build, lib/Foo.pm will contain:

     ...
    
     =begin html
    
     <img src="https://api.metacpan.org/source/CPANID/Your-Dist-Name-0.123/share/images/img1.jpg" />
    
     =end html
    
     =begin html
    
     <img src="https://api.metacpan.org/source/CPANID/Your-Dist-Name-0.123/share/images/img2.png" />
    
     =end html

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin finds # IMAGE directive in your POD/code and replace it
    with a POD containing HTML snippet to load the images, using the
    selected hosting provider's URL scheme.

    Rationale: sometimes documentation needs some images. Sometimes the
    proper (not to mention convenient) place to put the images is within
    the distribution itself. And you want to be able to view the images
    when you browse the POD in HTML form.

    The #IMAGE directive must occur at the beginning of line and must be
    followed by path to the image (relative to the distribution's root). It
    is recommended to put the images in share/images.

    You can put alternate locations by using |, e.g.:

     # IMAGE: location1.jpg|location2.jpg

    This can be useful if you are using hosting=data (where this plugin
    needs to read the content of the file) and location1.jpg is produced by
    another plugin and might not be ready or added to the build at the time
    this plugin runs (but location2.jpg is the temporary version of the
    file that already exists).

    Shared image files deployed inside a tarball (such as one created using
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball) are not yet supported.

CONFIGURATION

 hosting => str (default: metacpan)

    Choose hosting provider. Available choices:

      * metacpan

      This is the default because all distributions uploaded to PAUSE/CPAN
      will normally show up on metacpan.org. Note that some people advise
      not to abuse metacpan.org to host images because metacpan.org is not
      an image hosting service. However, at the time of this writing, I
      couldn't find any mention of this in the metacpan.org FAQ or About
      pages.

      * github

      This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository in
      its metadata, and the repository URL's host is github.com.

      * gitlab

      This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository in
      its metadata, and the repository URL's host is gitlab.com.

      * bitbucket

      This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository in
      its metadata, and the repository URL's host is bitbucket.org.

      * data

      Instead of using a remote http/https hosting provider, this will
      instead use data: URIs where the image data is directly embedded in
      the URL.

 include_files => str+

 exclude_files => str+

 include_file_pattern => re

 exclude_file_pattern => re
