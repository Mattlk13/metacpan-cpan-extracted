SEE ALSO
    JSON should also encode to a single-line string, but some data
    structures (cyclical, contains globs or other special Perl data) cannot
    be encoded out of the box to JSON.

    Data::Dumper::OneLine strives to do the same for Data::Dumper, but last
    time I tried it (at v0.05) it's still buggy.
