NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe - An author test for
    Pod Coverage

SYNOPSIS
        # Add this line to dist.ini
        [Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe]

        # Run this in the command line to test for POD coverage:
        $ dzil test --release

DESCRIPTION
    This extension provides a test file to check for Pod coverage using
    Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe. It is meant as a replacement for the
    [PodCoverageTests] plugin, but providing some additional options and
    using a different underlying test module.

OPTIONS
    filename
        The name of the test file to generate. Defaults to
        xt/author/pod-coverage.t.

    modules
        The modules to check for coverage.

        Aliased as "module".

    finder
        The file finder used to find modules to check. Will only be used if
        a list of modules is not given. Defaults to ":InstallModules".

        To generate the list of modules, the output of this finder will be
        filtered to only files ending in ".pm" and will be transformed to
        module names after stripping an initial "lib/".

    private
        Methods to treat as private, with their coverage not checked. Will
        be passed to Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe. String values can be
        passed directly. Regexp values can be passed with the form "/.../".
        Can be specified multiple times.

    also_private
        Exactly the same as "private", but adds to the list of default
        private methods rather than replacing it.

    trust_methods
        A list of methods to always treat as covered. Will be passed to
        Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe. Can be specified multiple times.

    require_content
    trust_parents
    trust_roles
    trust_packages
    trust_pod
    require_link
    export_only
    ignore_imported
        These options are all passed directly to
        Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe.

    options
        Additional options to pass to Test::Pod::Coverage::TrustMe. Options
        should be specified like:

            options = extra_option = 1
