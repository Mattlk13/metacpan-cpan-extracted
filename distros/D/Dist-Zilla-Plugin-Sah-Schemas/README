SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [Sah::Schemas]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin is to be used when building Sah-Schemas-* distribution. It
    currently does the following to lib/Sah/Schemas/* .pm files:

      * 

    It does the following to lib/Sah/Schema/* .pm files:

      * Check that schema is already normalized

      Otherwise, the build is aborted.

      * Set module abstract from the schema's summary

      * Add a prereq to other Sah::Schema::* module if schema depends on
      those other schemas

      * Produce pre-resolved editions of schemas into lib/Sah/SchemaR/*

      These are useful if a client wants to lookup the base type of a
      schema without having to do any extra resolving. Currently
      Perinci::Sub::Complete uses this to reduce startup overhead when
      doing tab completion.
