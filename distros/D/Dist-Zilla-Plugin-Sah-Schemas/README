NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas - Plugin to use when building
    Sah-Schemas-* distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.027 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Sah-Schemas), released on 2021-07-30.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Sah::Schemas]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is to be used when building "Sah-Schemas-*" distribution.

    It adds xt/release/sah-schema.t which does the following:

    *   Check that schema is already normalized

    *   Test examples in schema

    It does the following to every "lib/Sah/Schemas/*" .pm file:

    *

    It does the following to every "lib/Sah/Schema/*" .pm file:

    *   Set module abstract from the schema's summary

    *   Add a prereq to other Sah::Schema::* module if schema depends on
        those other schemas

    *   Produce pre-resolved editions of schemas into "lib/Sah/SchemaR/*"

        These are useful if a client wants to lookup the base type of a
        schema without having to do any extra resolving. Currently
        Perinci::Sub::Complete uses this to reduce startup overhead when
        doing tab completion.

CONFIGURATION
  exclude_module
    Currently this means to exclude loading the specified schema module
    during build, skip resolving the schema, skip parsing the schema and
    extracting prerequisites from the schema, the and skip creating the
    corresponding "Sah::SchemaR::*" module.
