NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas - Plugin to use when building
    Sah-Schemas-* distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.017 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Sah-Schemas), released on 2020-03-02.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Sah::Schemas]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is to be used when building "Sah-Schemas-*" distribution.

    It adds xt/release/sah-schema.t which does the following:

    *   Check that schema is already normalized

    *   Test examples in schema

    It does the following to every "lib/Sah/Schemas/*" .pm file:

    *

    It does the following to every "lib/Sah/Schema/*" .pm file:

    *   Set module abstract from the schema's summary

    *   Add a prereq to other Sah::Schema::* module if schema depends on
        those other schemas

    *   Produce pre-resolved editions of schemas into "lib/Sah/SchemaR/*"

        These are useful if a client wants to lookup the base type of a
        schema without having to do any extra resolving. Currently
        Perinci::Sub::Complete uses this to reduce startup overhead when
        doing tab completion.
