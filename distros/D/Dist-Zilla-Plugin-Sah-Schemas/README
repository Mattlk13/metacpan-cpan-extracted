NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas - Plugin to use when building
    Sah-Schemas-* distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.033 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Sah-Schemas), released on 2024-01-09.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [Sah::Schemas]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is to be used when building "Sah-Schemas-*" distribution.

    It adds xt/release/sah-schema.t which does the following:

    *   Check that schema is already normalized

    *   Test examples in schema

    It does the following to every "lib/Sah/Schemas/*" .pm file:

    *

    It does the following to every "lib/Sah/Schema/*" .pm file:

    *   Set module abstract from the schema's summary

    *   Add a prereq to other Sah::Schema::* module if schema depends on
        those other schemas

    *   Produce pre-resolved editions of schemas into "lib/Sah/SchemaR/*"

        These are useful if a client wants to lookup the base type of a
        schema without having to do any extra resolving. Currently
        Perinci::Sub::Complete uses this to reduce startup overhead when
        doing tab completion.

CONFIGURATION
  exclude_module
    Currently this means to exclude loading the specified schema module
    during build, skip resolving the schema, skip parsing the schema and
    extracting prerequisites from the schema, the and skip creating the
    corresponding "Sah::SchemaR::*" module.

  schemar_preamble
    Code to add at the beginning of generated Sah/SchemaR/*.pm files (put
    after the "package" statemnet).

  schemar_postamble
    Code to add at the end of generated Sah/SchemaR/*.pm files (put before
    the ending "1;").

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
