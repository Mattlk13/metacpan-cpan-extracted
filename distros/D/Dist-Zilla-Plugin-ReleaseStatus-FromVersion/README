NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReleaseStatus::FromVersion - Set release status
    from version number patterns

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        # in dist.ini
        [ReleaseStatus::FromVersion]
        testing = third_decimal_odd

DESCRIPTION
    This module tells Dist::Zilla to set a distribution's release status
    based on its version number.

    There are two attributes: "testing" and "unstable". Each is assigned a
    string corresponding to a rule to apply to the distribution's version.
    (See "Status rules")

    If the "unstable" rule is true, the release status will be 'unstable'.
    Otherwise, if the "testing" rule is true, the release status will be
    'testing'. Otherwise, the release status will be 'stable'.

    NOTE: Use of this plugin with version numbers with underscores – whether
    decimal or tuple – will result in a fatal error. This module replaces
    underscore heuristics to determine release status and is thus
    incompatible with such versions.

USAGE
    Add "[ReleaseStatus::FromVersion]" to your dist.ini and set the
    "testing" and/or "unstable" attributes. Keep in mind that "unstable" has
    the highest precedence.

  Status rules
   Default rule
    The default rule 'none' is always false.

   Decimal version rules
    This set of rules apply only to "decimal versions" — versions that that
    look like integers or floating point numbers. They will be false if
    applied to a version tuple.

    The only decimal rules so far check a particular digit after the decimal
    point and return true if the digit is odd:

        second_decimal_odd
        third_decimal_odd
        fourth_decimal_odd
        fifth_decimal_odd
        sixth_decimal_odd

    For example, here is the 'fourth_decimal_odd' rule applied to two
    version numbers:

        1.0100 — false
        1.0101 — true

   Tuple version rules
    This set of rules apply only to "tuple versions", aka "dotted-decimal
    versions" — versions that that look like "v1", "v1.2", "v1.2.3" and so
    on. They also apply to versions without the leading-v as long as there
    are more than two decimal points, e.g. "1.2.3". They will be false if
    applied to a decimal version.

    Tuple versions treat each decimal-separated value as an individual
    number.

    The only tuple rules so far check a particular element of the tuple and
    return true if the element is odd:

        second_element_odd
        third_element_odd
        fourth_element_odd

    For example, here is the 'second_element_odd' rule applied to two
    version numbers:

        v1.0.3 — false
        v1.1.3 — true

   New rules
    If you have an idea for a new rule, please look at how the existing
    rules are implemented and open a Github issue or send a pull-request
    with your idea.

ATTRIBUTES
  testing
    Rule for setting status to 'testing'. Must be one of the "Status Rules".

    The default is "none".

  unstable
    Rule for setting status to 'unstable'. Must be one of the "Status
    rules".

    This setting takes precedence over "testing".

    The default is "none".

EXAMPLE
    Here is a somewhat contrived example demonstrating precedence:

        [ReleaseStatus::FromVersion]

        unstable = second_decimal_odd
        testing  = fourth_decimal_odd

        # results for different possible version

        1.0000 — stable
        1.0100 — unstable
        1.0101 — unstable
        1.0200 — stable
        1.0201 — testing
        1.0202 — stable
