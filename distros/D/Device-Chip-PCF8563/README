NAME

    Device::Chip::PCF8563 - chip driver for a PCF8563

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a NXP
    PCF8563 chip attached to a computer via an I²C adapter.

METHODS

    The following methods documented with a trailing call to ->get return
    Future instances.

 read_time

       @tm = $pcf->read_time->get

    Returns a 7-element struct tm-compatible list of values by reading the
    timekeeping registers, suitable for passing to POSIX::mktime, etc...
    Note that the returned list does not contain the yday or is_dst fields.

    Because the PCF8563 only stores a 2-digit year number plus a single
    century bit, the year is presumed to be in the range 2000-2199.

    This method presumes POSIX-compatible semantics for the wday field
    stored on the chip; i.e. that 0 is Sunday.

    This method performs an atomic reading of all the timekeeping registers
    as a single I²C transaction, so is preferrable to invoking multiple
    calls to individual read methods.

 write_time

       $pcf->write_time( @tm )->get

    Writes the timekeeping registers from a 7-element struct tm-compatible
    list of values. This method ignores the yday and is_dst fields, if
    present.

    Because the PCF8563 only stores a 2-digit year number and a century
    bit, the year must be in the range 2000-2199 (i.e. numerical values of
    100 to 299).

    This method performs an atomic writing of all the timekeeping registers
    as a single I²C transaction, so is preferrable to invoking multiple
    calls to individual write methods.
