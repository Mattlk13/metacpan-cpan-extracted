NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::Authority - Add the $AUTHORITY variable
    and metadata to your distribution

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PERLANCAR::Authority (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PERLANCAR-Authority), released on 2020-08-10.

DESCRIPTION
    Fork note: This plugin is a fork of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority. When
    PAUSE credential is not found, this plugin will set $AUTHORITY to
    "cpan:<none>" instead of bailing out. TODO: bail if PAUSE credentials is
    not found and we are doing a release (instead of just 'dzil test' or
    'dzil build'). The rest is Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority's
    documentation.

    This plugin adds the authority data to your distribution. It adds the
    data to your modules and metadata. Normally it looks for the PAUSE
    author id in your Dist::Zilla configuration. If you want to override it,
    please use the 'authority' attribute.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [Authority]

    This code will be added to any package declarations in your perl files:

            our $AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';

    Your metadata ( META.yml or META.json ) will have an entry looking like
    this:

            x_authority => 'cpan:APOCAL'

ATTRIBUTES
  authority
    The authority you want to use. It should be something like
    "cpan:APOCAL".

    Defaults to the username set in the %PAUSE stash in the global
    config.ini or dist.ini ( Dist::Zilla v4 addition! )

    If you prefer to not put it in config/dist.ini you can put it in
    "~/.pause" just like Dist::Zilla did before v4.

  do_metadata
    A boolean value to control if the authority should be added to the
    metadata.

    Defaults to true.

  do_munging
    A boolean value to control if the $AUTHORITY variable should be added to
    the modules.

    Defaults to true.

  locate_comment
    A boolean value to control if the $AUTHORITY variable should be added
    where a "# AUTHORITY" comment is found. If this is set then an
    appropriate comment is found, and "our $AUTHORITY = 'cpan:PAUSEID';" is
    inserted preceding the comment on the same line.

    This basically implements what OurPkgVersion does for PkgVersion.

    Defaults to false.

    NOTE: If you use this method, then we will not use the pkg style of
    declaration! That way, we keep the line numbering consistent.

  authority_style
    A value to control the type of the $AUTHORITY declaration. There are two
    styles: 'pkg' or 'our'. In the past this module defaulted to the 'pkg'
    style but due to various issues 'our' is now the default. Here's what
    both styles would look like in the resulting code:

            # pkg
            BEGIN {
                    $Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';
            }

            # our
            our $AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';
