Data-Money

The README  is  used  to  introduce the module and provide instructions on how to
install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for example C compilers
and installed libraries) and any other information that should be provided before
the module is installed.

A  README  file  is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README file
from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive can use it to  get
an  idea  of  the  module's  uses.  It  is usually a good idea to provide version
information here so that people can decide whether fixes for the module are worth
downloading.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module  was  originally based on Data::Currency by Christopher H. Laco but I
opted to fork and create a whole new module because my work was wildly  different
from the original.I decided it was better to make a new module than to break back
compat and surprise users. Many thanks to him for the great module.

Inspiration and ideas were also drawn from Math::Currency and Math::BigFloat.
