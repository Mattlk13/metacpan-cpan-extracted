NAME
    Dancer2::Logger::LogAny - Use Log::Any to log from your Dancer2 app

VERSION
    version 0.9907

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a Dancer2 logging engine using "Log::Any". You
    can then use any "Log::Any::Adapter"-based output class on the backend.

METHODS
  log( @args )
    This is the function required by "Dancer2::Core::Role::Logger"

CONFIGURATION
    In your Dancer2 config:

      logger: LogAny
 
      engines:
          logger:
              LogAny:
                  category: Important Messages
                  logger:
                      - Stderr
                      - newline
                      - 1

    If you omit the category setting, "Log::Any::Adapter" will use the name
    of this class as the category.
