Dancer2::Logger::LogAny Sample App

This directory contains a simple Dancer2 app that demonstrates
use of Dancer2::Logger::LogAny.

Besides the logger (and Dancer2) you will have to install 
Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch.

Run the app with:

  $ perl example app.pl

And in a separate terminal run:

  $ tail -f /tmp/Dancer2_LogAny_example.log

Then in a browser load http://localhost:3000

You will see that the logger logs all messages to the file but
only those with level debug or higher to the console.

You don't have to use Log::Dispatch -- any Log::Any::Adapter-based
logging class will work. If you use only one logging class, refer to
the POD for configuration example.
