Release history for perl-Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Manifest-Read

v0.5.0 @ 2016-11-21 19:18 UTC

    -   **BREAKING CHANGE** `Manifest::Read` file finder now returns the *complete* list of all the
        manifested files, including the files which are not going to the distribution (files with
        `-` mark). Replace `Manifest::Read` with `Manifest::Read/:AllFiles` to keep your code
        working.

    -   All the sub-finders now have colon in name to better mimic standard `Dist::Zilla` finders,
        e. g.: `Manifest::Read/:AllFiles`, `Manifest::Read/:InstallModules`. Old finders (e. g.
        `Manifest::Read/AllFiles`) are also available but will be removed in future.

    -   Few more file finders added: `:IncModules`, `:NoFiles`, `:ShareFiles`.

v0.4.2 @ 2015-11-05 14:08 UTC

    -   Test: `:AllFiles` file finder was introduced in `Dist::Zilla` 5.007. So, a test fails with
        older `Dist::Zilla` due to lack of this finder. Test modified not to use these finders if
        `Dist::Zilla` is older than required.

v0.4.1 @ 2015-11-02 21:58 UTC

    -   Test: `:ExtraTestFiles` and `:PerlExecFiles` file finders were introduced in `Dist::Zilla`
        5.038. So, a test fails with older `Dist::Zilla` due to lack of these finders. Test
        modified not to use these finders if `Dist::Zilla` is older than required.

v0.4.0 @ 2015-11-01 17:30 UTC

    -   Additional file finders are implemented: `Manifest::Read/AllFiles`,
        `Manifest::Read/InstallModules`, etc.

    -   Test reworked: `Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Templates` is not used in tests any more.

v0.3.5 @ 2015-10-29 22:42 UTC

    -   Test fails if `Dist::Zilla::Role::ErrorLogger` is older than v0.9.0. Fixed by requiring
        this version.

v0.3.4 @ 2015-10-22 13:20 UTC

    [Overall]

    -   Distribution is rebuilt with the latest `Dist::Zilla` plugin bundle `@Author::VDB` v0.10.0.
        It includes few more tests. Most of the changes are made to make these new tests pass.

    [Code]

    -   `use version 0.77;` added. Just in case.

    [Documentation]

    -   Bad link found by the `Test::Pod::LinkCheck`, bad link fixed, `Test::Pod::LinkCheck`
        passes.

    [Tests]

    -   Test uses `# REQUIRE:` hint instead of direct `use`.

    -   Explicit requiring `Dist::Zilla::Tester::DieHard` v0.4.0 (added in v0.3.0) now dropped.
        The problem debugged and fixed, there is no need in this requirement any more.

    -   Test code simplified a bit.

    [Internals]

    -   `aspell.en.pws` file renamed to `aspell-en.pws` to make `Test::Portability` happy.

    -   Minor fixes in POD to make `Test::Synopsis` happy.

v0.3.3 @ 2015-10-03 11:56 UTC

    [Documentation]

    -   Documentation improved a bit.

    [Tests]

    -   Cygwin also has troubles with filenames containing backslashes. Such filenames are not used
        when tests run on Cygwin.

    -   Version v0.3.3 of `Test::Dist::Zilla::BuiltFiles` is explicitly required â€” it contains a
        workaround for `Path::Tiny` bug which affects tests.

v0.3.2 @ 2015-09-25 21:26 UTC

    [Tests]

    -   On MSWin32 platform `Dist::Zilla` rejects filenames containing backslashes with error "File
        name 'source/filename\3' does not seem to be legal on the current OS". To avoid test
        failure, let's exclude such names from testing on the problem platform.

v0.3.1 @ 2015-09-23 11:45 UTC

    -   Mostly internal changes:

        -   `log_errors_in_file` (from `ErrorLogger`) utilized. Error messages are slightly
            changed.

        -   Bunch of obsolete source files removed.

        -   A typo found and fixed in the test. Not sure it affects test failure on MSWin32, but
            let me see.

v0.3.0 @ 2015-09-20 21:56 UTC

    -   The test does not explicitly use but requires `Dist::Zilla::Tester::DieHard` v0.4.0 because
        the latter includes few debug warnings which (I hope) help me to debug strange test failure
        on MSWin32 machines.

    -   Decimal version switched to new dotted-decimal style.

0.002 @ 2015-08-29 18:32 UTC

    -   Bug #106739 "Test suite may fail with non-English locale". Fixed.

0.001 @ 2015-08-28 21:09 UTC

    -   Initial release
