=head1 WHAT?

C<Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Manifest-Read> (or C<Manifest::Read> for brevity) is a C<Dist::Zilla> plugin. It reads
I<annotated source> manifest, checks existence of all listed files and directories, and adds
selected files to the distribution. C<Manifest::Read> also does C<FileFinder> role, providing the
list of files for other plugins.

This is C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Manifest::Read> module documentation. Read this if you are going to hack or
extend C<Manifest::Read>, or use it programmatically.

If you want to have annotated source manifest, read the L<user manual|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Manifest::Read::Manual>.
General topics like getting source, building, installing, bug reporting and some others are covered
in the F<README>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your plugin:

    # Iterate through the distribution files listed in MANIFEST:
    my $finder = $self->zilla->plugin_named( 'Manifest::Read/:AllFiles' );
    for my $file ( @{ $finder->find_files() } ) {

This class consumes L<Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer> and C<Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> roles.
In order to fulfill requirements, the class implements C<gather_files> and C<find_files> methods.
Other methods are supporting.

The class also consumes L<Dist::Zilla::Role::ErrorLogger> role. It allows the class not to stop
at the first problem but continue and report multiple errors to user.
