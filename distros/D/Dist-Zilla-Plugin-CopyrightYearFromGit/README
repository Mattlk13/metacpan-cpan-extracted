SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [CopyrightYearFromGit]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will set copyright year to something like:

     2017, 2015, 2014, 2013

    where the years will be retrieved from 1) the date of git tags that
    resemble version string (qr/^(version|ver|v)?\d/); 2) current date; and
    will be listed in descending order in a comma-separated list. This
    format is commonly used in books, where the year of each
    revision/edition is mentioned, e.g.:

     Copyright (c) 2013, 2010, 2008, 2006 by Pearson Education, Inc.
