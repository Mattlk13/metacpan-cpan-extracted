NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyrightYearFromGit - Set copyright year from git

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyrightYearFromGit (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-CopyrightYearFromGit), released on 2021-08-24.

SYNOPSIS
    Suppose the current year is 2021 and you have release git tags for 2019,
    2017, 2016. The default setting will make copyright_year to be:

     2021, 2019, 2017, 2016

    In dist.ini:

     [CopyrightYearFromGit]
     ; release_tag_regex = ^v    ; optional, default is ^(version|ver|v)\d
     ; author_name_regex = foo   ; optional, default is none (any author name will be included)
     ; author_email_regex = foo  ; optional, default is none (any author email will be included)

     ; min_year = 2017           ; optional, setting this would make copyright_year become: 2021, 2019, 2017.

     ; include_year = 2015
     ; include_year = 2013       ; optional, setting this two lines would make copyright_year become: 2021, 2019, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2013.

     ; exclude_year = 2016
     ; exclude_year = 2017       ; optional, setting this two lines would make copyright_year become: 2021, 2019

     ; continuous_year = 1       ; optional, setting this would make copyright_year become: 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will set copyright_year to something like:

     2021, 2019, 2017, 2016

    where the years will be retrieved from: 1) the date of git tags that
    resemble version string (qr/^(version|ver|v)?\d/); 2) the current year.
    Years that do not see version tags and are not the current year will not
    be included, unless you set "continuous_year" or "include_year". On the
    other hand, years that see version tags or the current year can be
    excluded via "min_year" or "exclude_year".

    The included years will be listed in descending order in a
    comma-separated list. This format is commonly used in books, where the
    year of each revision/edition is mentioned, e.g.:

     Copyright (c) 2013, 2010, 2008, 2006 by Pearson Education, Inc.

CONFIGURATION
  release_tag_regex
    String (regex pattern). Specify a custom regular expression for matching
    git release tags.

    An old alias "regex" is still recognized, but deprecated.

  author_name_regex
    String (regex pattern). Only consider release commits where author name
    matches this regex.

  author_email_regex
    String (regex pattern). Only consider release commits where author email
    matches this regex.

  min_year
    Integer. Instruct the plugin to not include years below this year. If
    "min_year" is (incorrectly) set to a value larger than the current year,
    then the current year will be used instead. Note that "include_year" and
    "exclude_year" override "min_year".

  include_year
    Integer (can be specified multiple times). Force-include one or more
    years. Note that "exclude_year" overrides "include_year".

  exclude_year
    Integer (can be specified multiple times). Force-exclude one or more
    years. Note that "continuous_year" overrides "exclude_year".

  continuous_year
    Boolean. If set to true, will make copyright_year a continuous range
    from the smallest included year to the largest included year, with no
    gap inside.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
