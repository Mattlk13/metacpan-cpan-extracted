NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyrightYearFromGit - Set copyright year from git

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyrightYearFromGit (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-CopyrightYearFromGit), released on 2019-10-24.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [CopyrightYearFromGit]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will set copyright year to something like:

     2017, 2015, 2014, 2013

    where the years will be retrieved from 1) the date of git tags that
    resemble version string (qr/^(version|ver|v)?\d/); 2) current date; and
    will be listed in descending order in a comma-separated list. This
    format is commonly used in books, where the year of each
    revision/edition is mentioned, e.g.:

     Copyright (c) 2013, 2010, 2008, 2006 by Pearson Education, Inc.

CONFIGURATION
  min_year
    Instruct the plugin to not include years below this year. Note that the
    current year will always be used, even though "min_year" is
    (incorrectly) set to a value larger than the current year.

  release_tag_regex
    Specify a custom regular expression for matching git release tags.

    An old alias "regex" is still recognized, but deprecated.

  author_name_regex
    Only consider release commits where author name matches this regex.

  author_email_regex
    Only consider release commits where author email matches this regex.
