NAME
    Devel::Caller::Util - caller()-related utility routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.042 of Devel::Caller::Util (from Perl
    distribution Devel-Caller-Util), released on 2019-04-12.

SYNOPSIS
     use Devel::Util::Caller qw(caller callers);

     my @info = caller(3);

     my @callers = callers();

FUNCTIONS
  caller
    Usage:

     caller([ $offset [, $with_args [, $packages_to_ignore [, $subroutines_to_ignore ] ] ] ]) => LIST

    Just like the built-in "caller()", except with three additional optional
    arguments. Will return this list:

         #  0          1           2       3             4          5            6           7             8        9          10
         ($package1, $filename1, $line1, $subroutine1, $hasargs1, $wantarray1, $evaltext1, $is_require1, $hints1, $bitmask1, $hinthash1)

    If $with_args is true, will also return subroutine arguments in the 11th
    element of the result, produced by retrieving @DB::args.

    $packages_to_ignore can be set to a regex (will be matched against
    $packageI) or an arrayref of package names.

    Similarly, $subroutines_to_ignore can be set to a regex or an arrayref
    of subroutine names. Note that subroutine names are fully qualified
    names.

  callers([ $start=0 [, $with_args [, $packages_to_ignore [, $subroutines_to_ignore ] ] ] ]) => LIST
    A convenience function to return the whole callers stack, produced by
    calling "caller()" repeatedly from frame "$start+1" until "caller()"
    returns empty. Result will be like:

     (
         #  0          1           2       3             4          5            6           7             8        9          10
         [$package1, $filename1, $line1, $subroutine1, $hasargs1, $wantarray1, $evaltext1, $is_require1, $hints1, $bitmask1, $hinthash1],
         [$package2, $filename2, $line2, ...],
         ...
     )

    See "caller" for more information about the three additional, optional
    arguments.
