NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::TemplateFlute - Dancer2 form handler for
    Template::Flute template engine

VERSION
    Version 0.202

SYNOPSIS
    Display template with checkout form:

        get '/checkout' => sub {
            my $form;

            $form = form( name => 'checkout', source => 'session' );
        
            template 'checkout', { form => $form };
        };

    Retrieve form input from checkout form body:

        post '/checkout' => sub {
            my ($form, $values);

            $form = form( name => 'checkout', source => 'body' );
            $values = $form->values;
        };

    Reset form after completion to prevent old data from showing up on new
    form:

        form('checkout')->reset;

    If you have multiple forms then just pass the form token as an array
    reference:

        get '/cart' => sub {
            my ( $cart_form, $inquiry_form );

            # 'source' defaults to 'session' if not provided
            $cart_form    = form( name => 'cart' );

            # equivalent to form( name => 'inquiry' )
            $inquiry_form = form( 'inquiry' );
        
            template 'checkout', { form => [ $cart_form, $inquiry_form ] };
        };

KEYWORDS
  form <$name|%params>
    The following %params are recognised:

   name
    The name of the form. Defaults to 'main'.

   values
        my $form = form( 'main', values => $params );

    The form parameters as a Hash::MultiValue object or something that can
    be coerced into one.

    Instead of "values" you can also use "source" to set initial values.

   source
        my $form = form( name => 'main', source => 'body' );

    The following values are valid:

    body
        This sets the form values to the request body parameters
        Dancer2::Core::Request::body_parameters.

    query
        This sets the form values to the request query parameters
        Dancer2::Core::Request::query_parameters.

    parameters
        This sets the form values to the combined body and request query
        parameters Dancer2::Core::Request::parameters.

    session
        Reads in values from the session. This is the default if no "source"
        or "parameters" are specified.

    NOTE: if both "source" and "values" are supplied then values is ignored.

    See Dancer2::Plugin::TemplateFlute::Form for details of other parameters
    that can be used.

DESCRIPTION
    "Dancer2::Plugin::TemplateFlute" is used for forms with the
    Dancer2::Template::TemplateFlute templating engine.

    Form fields, values and errors are stored into and loaded from the
    session key "form".
