NAME

    Device::Chip::TSL256x - chip driver for TSL256x

SYNOPSIS

       use Device::Chip::TSL256x;
       use Future::AsyncAwait;
    
       my $chip = Device::Chip::TSL256x->new;
       await $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new );
    
       await $chip->power(1);
    
       sleep 1; # Wait for one integration cycle
    
       printf "Current ambient light level is %.2f lux\n",
          scalar await $chip->read_lux;

DESCRIPTION

    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a TAOS
    TSL2560 or TSL2561 attached to a computer via an I²C adapter.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of
    this chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

ACCESSORS

    The following methods documented in an await expression return Future
    instances.

 read_config

       $config = await $chip->read_config;

    Returns a HASH reference of the contents of control and timing
    registers, using fields named from the data sheet.

       POWER => OFF | ON
       GAIN  => 1 | 16
       INTEG => 13ms | 101ms | 402ms

    Additionally, the following keys are provided calculated from those, as
    a convenience.

       integ_msec => 13.7 | 101 | 402

 change_config

       await $chip->change_config( %changes );

    Writes updates to the control and timing registers.

    Note that this method will ignore the integ_msec convenience value.

    Note that these two methods use a cache of configuration bytes to make
    subsequent modifications more efficient. This cache will not respect
    the "one-shot" nature of the Manual bit.

 enable_agc

       $chip->enable_agc( $agc )

    Accessor for the internal gain-control algorithm. If enabled, the GAIN
    configuration will be automatically controlled to switch between high-
    and low-level settings.

 read_id

       $id = await $chip->read_id;

    Returns the chip's ID register value.

 read_data0

 read_data1

       $data0 = await $chip->read_data0;
    
       $data1 = await $chip->read_data1;

    Reads the current values of the ADC channels.

 read_data

       ( $data0, $data1 ) = await $chip->read_data;

    Read the current values of both ADC channels in a single I²C
    transaction.

METHODS

 power

       await $chip->power( $on );

    Enables or disables the main power control bits in the CONTROL
    register.

 read_lux

       $lux = await $chip->read_lux;
    
       ( $lux, $data0, $data1 ) = await $chip->read_lux;

    Reads the two data registers then performs the appropriate scaling
    calculations to return a floating-point number that approximates the
    light level in Lux.

    Currently this conversion code presumes the contants for the T, FN and
    CL chip types.

    In list context, also returns the raw $data0 and $data1 channel values.
    The controlling code may wish to use these to adjust the gain if
    required.
