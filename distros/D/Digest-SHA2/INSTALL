INSTALLATION

To install Digest::SHA2, type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are using a C compiler that does not support 64-bit operations,
i.e., does not understand "long long" types, please comment out the
line

    'DEFINE' => '-DSHA2_USE_INTTYPES_H',

in the Makefile.PL.
