0.63 Not Released

 - Added CODE as another :type, rmap_code to only replace CODE refs
   (in :all export too) and also recurse into the CODE slot of a glob.
   Note that CODE is not part of ALL, you need rmap_to with (ALL | CODE).
   Recursing the CODE slot of GLOB *IS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE*
   (but rare enough and hard to work-around).
