NAME
    Data::TableData::Pick - Pick randomly one or more table rows, with some
    options

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Data::TableData::Pick (from
    Perl distribution Data-TableData-Pick), released on 2022-05-20.

FUNCTIONS
  pick_table_rows
    Usage:

     pick_table_rows(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Pick randomly one or more table rows, with some options.

    This function takes "table", a table data (either aos, aoaos, aohos, or
    a Data::TableData::Object instance) and picks one or more random rows
    from it and return the rows in the form of of aoaos or aohos.

    No duplicates are picked (i.e. no resampling a.k.a. sampling without
    replacement), but of course duplicate rows can still happen if the input
    table itself contain duplicate rows.

    If the requested number of rows ("n") exceed the number of rows of the
    table, only up to the number of rows of the table are returned.

    Weighting option. You can specify the name of column that contains
    weight.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   n => *posint* (default: 1)

        Number of rows to pick.

    *   table* => *any*

        A table data (either aos, aoaos, aohos, or a Data::TableData::Object
        instance).

    *   weight_column => *str*

        Specify column name that contains weight.

        If not specified, all rows will have the equal weight of 1.

        Weight must be a non-negative real number.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
