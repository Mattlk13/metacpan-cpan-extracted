METHODS

 $obj->check_dist_defines_rinci_meta => bool

    Will return true if dist defines Rinci metadata. Currently this is done
    via the following: 1) load all the module files and check whether %SPEC
    in the corresponding package contains stuffs; 2) analyze all the
    scripts using PPI and try to find any assignment like $SPEC{something}
    = { ... } (this might miss some stuffs).
