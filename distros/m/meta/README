NAME

    meta - meta-programming API (PLACEHOLDER)

DESCRIPTION

    This is a placeholder module for what will hopefully become a new
    dual-life core module, which is currently in development.

    The module description may eventually be something like:

    This package provides an API for metaprogramming; that is, allowing
    code to inspect or manipulate parts of its own program structure. Parts
    of the perl interpreter itself can be accessed by means of
    "meta"-objects provided by this package. Methods on these objects allow
    inspection of details, as well as creating new items or removing
    existing ones.

    The intention of this API is to provide a nicer replacement for
    existing tricks such as no strict 'refs' and using globrefs, and also
    to be a more consistent place to add new abilities, such as more APIs
    for inspection and alteration of internal structures, metaprogramming
    around the new 'class' feature, and other such uses.
