# Contributing to this project

Before you go crazy with huge changes, send some small e-mail to check
that we want to change the tools in that way. E-mail that have one logical
change are better.

Good e-mail, patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help.
They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant e-mail (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project
(indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such
as test coverage).

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner
to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
