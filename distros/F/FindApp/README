FindApp

version 0.0.1: alpha

This is an early alpha pre-release of the FindApp module suite.  
Two scripts are installed, and around three dozen libraries.
Since it's alpha, some low-level details may change.

Everything works and all low-level classes are exaustively tests,
but the documentation needs to be written and a few of the high-level
tests need fleshing out.

The public interface is intended to be the top-level FindApp module itself,
or its two pragmata.  However, the exported functions under FindApp::Utils
are also fair game, as are the objects in FindApp::Utils::Package::Object.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
standard Unix man command:

    man FindApp

If that fails, your MANPATH is probably set up wrong and you
will probably be forced to use the awful perldoc program instead.
