NAME

    File::Find::utf8 - Fully UTF-8 aware File::Find

VERSION

    version 0.013

SYNOPSIS

        # Use the utf-8 versions of find and finddepth
        use File::Find::utf8;
        find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
    
        # Revert back to non-utf-8 versions
        no File::Find::utf8;
        finddepth(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
    
        # Export only the find function
        use File::Find::utf8 qw(find);
        find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
    
        # Export no functions
        use File::Find::utf8 qw(:none); # NOT "use File::Find::utf8 qw();"!
        File::Find::find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);

DESCRIPTION

    While the original File::Find functions are capable of handling UTF-8
    quite well, they expect and return all data as bytes, not as
    characters.

    This module replaces the File::Find functions with fully UTF-8 aware
    versions, both expecting and returning characters.

    Note: Replacement of functions is not done on DOS, Windows, and OS/2 as
    these systems do not have full UTF-8 file system support.

 Behaviour

    The module behaves as a pragma so you can use both use File::Find::utf8
    and no File::Find::utf8 to turn utf-8 support on or off.

    By default, both find() and finddepth() are exported (as with the
    original File::Find), if you want to prevent this, use use
    File::Find::utf8 qw(:none). (As all the magic happens in the module's
    import function, you can not simply use use File::Find::utf8 qw())

    File::Find warning levels are properly propagated. Note though that for
    propagation of fatal File::Find warnings, Perl 5.12 or higher is
    required (or the appropriate version of warnings).

ATTRIBUTES

 $File::Find::utf8::SPECIALVARS

    By default File::Find::utf8 only decodes the normal File::Find
    variables $_, $File::Find::name, $File::Find::dir, and (when follow or
    follow_fast is in effect) $File::Find::fullname for use in the
    preprocess, wanted, and postporcess functions.

    If for any reason (e.g., compatibility with find.pl or find2perl) you
    also need the special variables $File::Find::topdir,
    $File::Find::topdev, $File::Find::topino, $File::Find::topmode, and
    $File::Find::topnlink to be decoded, specify local
    $File::Find::utf8::COMPATILBILITY = 1; in your code. The extra decoding
    that needs to happen will impact performance though, so use only when
    absolutely necessary.

 $File::Find::utf8::UTF8_CHECK

    By default File::Find::utf8 marks decoding errors as fatal (default
    value for this setting is Encode::FB_CROAK). If you want, you can
    change this by setting File::Find::utf8::UTF8_CHECK. The value
    Encode::FB_WARN reports the encoding errors as warnings, and
    Encode::FB_DEFAULT will completely ignore them. Please see Encode for
    details. Note: Encode::LEAVE_SRC is always enforced.

BUGS

    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://github.com/HayoBaan/File-Find-utf8/issues>.

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

COMPATIBILITY

    The filesystems of Dos, Windows, and OS/2 do not (fully) support UTF-8.
    The File::Find function will therefore not be replaced on these
    systems.

      * utf8::all -- Turn on utf-8, all of it. This was also the module I
      first added the utf-8 aware versions of Cwd and File::Find to before
      moving them to their own package.
