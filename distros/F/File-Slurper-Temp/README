NAME
    File::Slurper::Temp - File::Slurper + File::Temp

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of File::Slurper::Temp (from Perl
    distribution File-Slurper-Temp), released on 2019-07-16.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use File::Slurper's "write_text" or "write_binary":

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text write_binary);
     write_text("/tmp/foo.txt", "some text");
     write_binary("/tmp/bar", $somedata);

    Use "write_text_to_tempfile" and "write_binary_to_tempfile":

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text_to_tempfile write_binary_to_tempfile);
     my $filename1 = write_text_to_tempfile("some text");
     my $filename2 = write_binary_to_tempfile($somedata);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple combination of File::Slurper and File::Temp. It
    provides "write_text" and "write_binary" (as well as a couple of
    functions of its own). The two functions are the same as their original
    in File::Slurper but they will first write to a temporary file created
    by File::Temp's "tempfile", then "rename()" the temporary file to the
    originally specified name. If the filename is originally a symlink, it
    will be replaced with a regular file by "rename()". This can avoid
    symlink attack.

    In addition to that, this module also provides
    L/<write_text_to_tempfile> and write_binary_to_tempfile. You don't have
    to specify filename but just content to write and the functions will
    return the temporay filename created.

FUNCTIONS
  write_text
    Usage:

     write_text($filename, $content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

    Just like the original File::Slurper's version, except will write to
    temporary file created by File::Temp's "tempfile" first, then rename the
    temporary file using "rename()". The function will croak if "rename()"
    fails.

    To make sure that "rename()" doesn't fail when the default temporary
    directory (e.g. "/tmp") is on a different filesystem (because "rename()"
    does not work across filesystem boundary), the temporary file is created
    with option "DIR => dirname($filename)" . If you want to set a specific
    temporary directory, set $FILE_TEMP_DIR (see source code).

  write_binary
    Usage:

     write_binary($filename, $content)

  write_text_to_tempfile
    Usage:

     $tempname = write_text_to_tempfile($content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

    Temporary file is created with default option
    ("File::Temp::tempfile()").

  write_binary_to_tempfile
    Usage:

     $tempname = write_binary_to_tempfile($content)
