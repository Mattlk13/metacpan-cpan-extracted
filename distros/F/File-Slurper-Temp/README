SYNOPSIS

    Use like you would use File::Slurper's write_text or write_binary:

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text write_binary);
     write_text("/tmp/foo.txt", "some text");
     write_binary("/tmp/bar", $somedata);

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a simple combination of File::Slurper and File::Temp. It
    provides write_text and write_binary. The functions are the same as
    their original in File::Slurper but they will first write to a
    temporary file created by File::Temp's tempfile, then rename the
    temporary file to the originally specified name. If the filename is
    originally a symlink, it will be replaced with a regular file. This can
    avoid symlink attack.
