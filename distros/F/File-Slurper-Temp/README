NAME
    File::Slurper::Temp - File::Slurper + File::Temp

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of File::Slurper::Temp (from Perl
    distribution File-Slurper-Temp), released on 2019-07-21.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use File::Slurper's "write_text" and "write_binary":

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text write_binary);
     write_text("/tmp/foo.txt", "some text");
     write_binary("/tmp/bar", $somedata);

    Use "write_text_to_tempfile" and "write_binary_to_tempfile":

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text_to_tempfile write_binary_to_tempfile);
     my $filename1 = write_text_to_tempfile("some text");
     my $filename2 = write_binary_to_tempfile($somedata);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple combination of File::Slurper and File::Temp. It
    provides its version of "write_text" and "write_binary", as well as a
    couple of functions of its own.

    This module's version of "write_text" and "write_binary" write to
    temporary file first using File::Temp's tempfile() before renaming to
    the final destination path using Perl's rename(). If the destination
    path is originally a symlink, it will be replaced with a regular file by
    "rename()". This can avoid symlink attack.

    In addition the above two functions, this module also provides
    "write_text_to_tempfile" and "write_binary_to_tempfile". You don't have
    to specify destination path but just content to write, and the functions
    will return the temporary filename created.

FUNCTIONS
  write_text
    Usage:

     write_text($filename, $content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

    Just like the original File::Slurper's version, except will write to
    temporary file created by File::Temp's "tempfile" first, then rename the
    temporary file using Perl's "rename()". The function will croak if
    "rename()" fails.

    By default, the temporary file is created in the same directory as
    $filename, using "tempfile()"'s option "DIR => dirname($filename)". If
    you want to set a specific temporary directory, set $FILE_TEMP_DIR (see
    source code). But keep in mind that "rename()" doesn't work
    cross-device.

  write_binary
    Usage:

     write_binary($filename, $content)

  write_text_to_tempfile
    Usage:

     $tempname = write_text_to_tempfile($content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

    Temporary file is created with default option
    ("File::Temp::tempfile()").

  write_binary_to_tempfile
    Usage:

     $tempname = write_binary_to_tempfile($content)
