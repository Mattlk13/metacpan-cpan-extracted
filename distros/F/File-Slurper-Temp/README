NAME
    File::Slurper::Temp - File::Slurper + File::Temp

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of File::Slurper::Temp (from Perl
    distribution File-Slurper-Temp), released on 2019-01-14.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use File::Slurper's "write_text" or "write_binary":

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text write_binary);
     write_text("/tmp/foo.txt", "some text");
     write_binary("/tmp/bar", $somedata);

    Use "write_text_to_tempfile" and "write_binary_to_tempfile":

     use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text_to_tempfile write_binary_to_tempfile);
     my $filename1 = write_text_to_tempfile("some text");
     my $filename2 = write_binary_to_tempfile($somedata);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple combination of File::Slurper and File::Temp. It
    provides "write_text" and "write_binary". The functions are the same as
    their original in File::Slurper but they will first write to a temporary
    file created by File::Temp's "tempfile", then rename the temporary file
    to the originally specified name. If the filename is originally a
    symlink, it will be replaced with a regular file. This can avoid symlink
    attack.

    In addition to that, this module also provides "write_text_to_tempfile"
    and "write_binary_to_tempfile". You don't have to specify filename but
    just content to write and the functions will return the temporay
    filename created.

FUNCTIONS
  write_text
  write_binary
  write_text_to_tempfile
  write_binary_to_tempfile
