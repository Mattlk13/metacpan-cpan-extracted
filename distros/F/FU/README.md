## Build & Install

```sh
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
```

## Project ideas

Things that may or may not happen:

- FU::JSON - JSON::{XS,PP,etc}-compatible wrapper around FU::Util's JSON functions? I prolly won't need this myself, but could be handy.
- FU::DBI - DBI wrapper with a FU::Pg-like API, for easier integration into FU.
