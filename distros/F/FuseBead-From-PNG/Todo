TODO list for Perl module FuseBead::From::PNG

- add more bead colors
- indexed pngs break the color optimization process, needs to be true rgb mode, figure out solution
- add support for a 'paint-by-numbers' version of the instructions, allow custom mapping of colors to numbers / symbols
- add support to modify cells to change to different supported beads in the html view
- use perler bead images instead of cell background colors...
