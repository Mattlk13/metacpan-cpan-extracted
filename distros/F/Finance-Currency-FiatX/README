VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Finance::Currency::FiatX (from
    Perl distribution Finance-Currency-FiatX), released on 2018-05-10.

SYNOPSIS
    See fiatx from App::fiatx for an example on how to use this module.

DESCRIPTION
    FiatX is a library/application to convert one fiat currency to another
    using several backend modules ("Finance::Currency::Convert::*") and
    store the rates in DBI database.

FUNCTIONS
  convert_fiat_currency
    Usage:

     convert_fiat_currency(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Convert fiat currency using current rate.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   amount => *num* (default: 1)

    *   dbh => *obj*

    *   from* => *currency::code*

    *   max_age_cache => *posint* (default: 14400)

        Above this age (in seconds), we retrieve rate from remote source
        again.

    *   max_age_current => *posint* (default: 86400)

        Above this age (in seconds), we no longer consider the rate to be
        "current" but "historical".

    *   table_prefix => *str* (default: "fiatx_")

    *   to* => *currency::code*

    *   type => *str* (default: "sell")

        Which rate is wanted? e.g. sell, buy.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
