Changelog for FCGI-Daemon
#########################

2015-12-26 Dmitry Smirnov <onlyjob@cpan.org>  

  Maintenance release:
  * Minor doc, formatting and perlcritic corrections.
  * "use 5.14.2;" due to know memory leak in earlier versions.
  * Don't blame "fcgiwrap" for not forwarding STDERR: "fcgiwrap" redirects
    STDERR output from executed CGI if started with "-f".
  * Make list in the docs actually render as a list in POD (Closes: #84697)
    Thanks, Michael Stevens.
  * Set RLIMITS using BSD::Resource.
    Perl 5.14.2 (and earlier releases) provided "sys/resource.ph" which is
    no longer present in 5.20.2 (and later versions).

  * Evaluated scripts no longer pollute error log on exit
  * Error message for non-executable scripts goes to STDERR and to the STDOUT
  * Added regex pattern (-f) to match file name and identify perl scripts with
    any extension (not only .pl as previously) for evaluation so
    .cgi scripts can be accelerated too, if written in Perl.
  * Documentation update
  * Configuration examples for use with nginx
