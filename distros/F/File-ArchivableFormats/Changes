Revision history for File::ArchivableFormats

1.8       2020-06-02 03:20:25Z

    * Fix Path::Tiny glitches. Path::Tiny doesn't have a `seek` method
      and thus fails in combination with File::MimeInfo::Magic.
      It does however sees text/x-readme and text/markdown correctly,
      added then to the DANS. Since it is text I consider this to be
      valid (the spec might say differently, but Markdown is text and so
      is a README file).
    * Remove version requirement of IO from 1.39, solved with Perl dep bump
    * Bump minimal perl version to 5.12
