=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functionalty for handling file name suffixes (aka
file name extensions).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 fileparse FILEPATH

=head2 fileparse FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

=head2 basename FILEPATH

=head2 basename FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

=head2 dirname FILEPATH

=head2 fileparse_set_fstype FSTYPE

These functions are exactly the same as the corresponding ones from
L<File::Basename> except that they aren't exported by default.

=head2 basename_suffix FILEPATH

=head2 basename_suffix FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Returns the file name suffix part of the given filepath. The default
suffix patterns are used if none are provided. Behaves the same as
C<basename>, i.e., it uses the last last level of a filepath as
filename, even if the last level is clearly directory.

Also, like C<basename>, files that consist of only a matched suffix
are treated as if they do not have a suffix. So, using the default
suffix pattern, C<basename_suffix('/Users/home/.profile')> would
return an empty string.

Note: Like the original C<basename> function from L<File::Basename>,
suffix patterns are automatically escaped so pattern C<.bar> only
matches C<.bar> and not e.g., C<_bar> (this is B<not> done for the
default suffix patterns, nor for patterns provided to the non-basename
family functions of this module!).

=head2 basename_nosuffix FILEPATH

=head2 basename_nosuffix FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Acts basically the same as the original C<basename> function, except
that the default suffix patterns are used to strip the name of its
suffixes when none are provided.

Also, like C<basename>, files that consist of only a matched suffix
are treated as if they do not have a suffix. So, using the default
suffix pattern, C<basename_nosuffix('/Users/home/.profile')> would
return C<.profile>.

Note: Like the original C<basename> function from L<File::Basename>,
suffix patterns are automatically escaped so pattern C<.bar> only
matches C<.bar> and not e.g., C<_bar> (this is B<not> done for the
default suffix patterns, nor for patterns provided to the non-basename
family of functions of this module!).

=head2 filename FILEPATH

=head2 filename FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Returns just the filename of the filepath, optionally stripping the
suffix when it matches a provided suffix patterns. Basically the same
as calling C<fileparse> in scalar context.

=head2 filename_suffix FILEPATH

=head2 filename_suffix FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Returns the matched suffix of the filename. The default suffix
patterns are used when none are provided.

=head2 filename_nosuffix FILEPATH

=head2 filename_nosuffix FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Returns the filename with the the matched suffix stripped. The default
suffix patterns are used when none are provided.

=head2 pathname FILEPATH

Returns the path part of the file. Contrary to C<dirname>, a filepath
that is clearly a directory, is treated as such (e.g., on Unix,
C<pathname('/foo/bar/')> returns C</foo/bar/>).

=head2 fullname FILEPATH

=head2 fullname FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Returns the provided filepath, optionally stripping the filename of
its matching suffix.

=head2 fullname_suffix FILEPATH

=head2 fullname_suffix FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Synonym for filename_suffix.

=head2 fullname_nosuffix FILEPATH

=head2 fullname_nosuffix FILEPATH PATTERN_LIST

Returns the full filepath with the the matched suffix stripped. The
default suffix patterns are used when none are provided.

=head2 default_suffix_patterns

=head2 default_suffix_patterns NEW_PATTERN_LIST

The default suffix pattern list (see the C<fileparse> function in
L<File::Basename> for details) is C<qr/\.[^.]*/>. Meaning that this
defines the suffix as the part of the filename from (and including)
the last dot. In other words, the part of a filename that is popularly
known as the file extension.

You can alter the suffix matching by proving this function with a
different pattern list.

This function returns the pattern list that was effective I<before>
optionally changing it.
