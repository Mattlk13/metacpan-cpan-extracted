=head1 NAME

dbcoltype - define (or redefine) types for columns of an Fsdb file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dbcol [-v] [column type...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Define the type of each column, where COLUMN and TYPE are pairs.
Or, with the C<-v> option, redefine all types as string.

The data does not change (just the header).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-v> or B<--clear-types>

Remove definitions from columns that are listed,
or from all columns if none are listed.
The effect is to restore types to their default type of "a" (string).

begin_standard_fsdb_options

and the standard fsdb options:

=over 4

=item B<-d>

Enable debugging output.

=item B<-i> or B<--input> InputSource

Read from InputSource, typically a file, or - for standard input,
or (if in Perl) a IO::Handle, Fsdb::IO or Fsdb::BoundedQueue objects.

=item B<-o> or B<--output> OutputDestination

Write to OutputDestination, typically a file, or - for standard output,
or (if in Perl) a IO::Handle, Fsdb::IO or Fsdb::BoundedQueue objects.

=item B<--autorun> or B<--noautorun>

By default, programs process automatically,
but Fsdb::Filter objects in Perl do not run until you invoke
the run() method.
The C<--(no)autorun> option controls that behavior within Perl.

=item B<--header> H

Use H as the full Fsdb header, rather than reading a header from
then input.

=item B<--help>

Show help.

=item B<--man>

Show full manual.
