NAME

    Future::AsyncAwait::Metrics - report metrics from Future::AsyncAwait to
    Metrics::Any

SYNOPSIS

       use Future::AsyncAwait::Metrics;
    
       # Additional metrics will now be reported

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides no functions or other import symbols. Instead, by
    simply loading it somewhere in the program, additional metrics are
    created and reported to Metrics::Any about the operation of
    Future::AsyncAwait.

METRICS

    The following metrics are reported:

 asyncawait_suspends

    A counter of the number of times an async sub has been suspended.

 asyncawait_resumes

    A counter of the number of times an async sub has been resumed.

 asyncawait_current_subs

    A gauge giving the current count of async sub instances currently
    suspended.

 asyncawait_states_created

    A counter of the number of times that async sub context storage has
    been created. This may be less than asyncawait_suspends because storage
    is reused for multiple await calls within any one function invocation.

 asyncawait_states_destroyed

    A counter giving the number of times that async sub context storage has
    been destroyed.

 asyncawait_current_states

    A gauge giving the current count of async sub context storage
    instances. This may be less than asyncawait_current_subs because not
    all of them may be currently suspended.
