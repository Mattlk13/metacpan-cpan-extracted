Thoughts about future releases, in no particular order.
Feel free to share your thoughts with me at  mob@cpan.org 
or through  http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Forks-Super

Possible TODOs:

    _x_ support sockets/pipes for cmd-style forks like IPC::Open3 does.
	_X_ for Unixy systems
	___ for MSWin32
	    IPC::Open3 supports MSWin32/os2 with the <system 1, @_>
	    construction. Don't think that is appropriate for this module.

    ___ There's enough stuff in here now that performance is affected,
	especially when there are lots of short tasks. What can be done
	to tighten up performance? What can be done to reduce overhead
	when there are many short tasks?
	___ disable $FSJ::Ipc::USE_TIE_?H? need to benchmark
	_X_ tighten some delays in file-based IPC
        ___ shorten $Forks::Super::Deferred::QUEUE_MONITOR_FREQ

    ___ fork { run => [ \@cmd, ... ] }
	to invoke or emulate IPC::Run's rich feature set
	___ What else can I learn by studying IPC::Run?

    ___ What other key-value pairs should FSJ::read_stdxxx handle?
	_X_ warn => 0|1
	_X_ timeout => max number of seconds to wait for input
        ___ log => 0|1|*handle|\@list?

    ___ No complaints yet, but is there a smarter way to
        set the IPC directory?
        ___ detect NFS and search for alternatives? NFS affects flock sync, too
    ___ Refactor how we create and remove the temp IPC directory.

    _X_ Runtime IPC cleanup routine for long running programs. For long
	completed jobs: close the open filehandles that have slipped
	through the cracks; remove the IPC files; move from 
	%ALL_JOBS,@ALL_JOBS to %ARCHIVED_JOBS,@ARCHIVED_JOBS

    ___ Demos/examples/cookbook section.
        ___ Perform 1000's of jobs, 20 at a time
            ___ with queueing to perform other tasks
            ___ example: web crawler
	    _x_ example: multi-threaded du
        _x_ timeout long running jobs
        _x_ manipulate CPU affinities
        ___ dependencies
        ___ interactive client/server example of IPC
        ___ run a server using Forks::Super
        _x_ see t/forked_harness.pl
        _X_ load management
            _X_ block while system is busy
            _X_ suspend/resume
            _X_ suspend/resume callback
        ___ bg_eval, bg_qx examples
	    _X_ factorial.pl for bg_eval
        ___ can_launch examples
        ___ how to: use sleep with Forks::Super
        ___ how to: use alarm with Forks::Super
        ___ changing IPC_DIR
        ___ tuning Forks::Super for fast jobs, slow jobs,
	    memory intensive jobs, cpu intensive jobs,
	    I/O bound jobs
        ___ scheduler app that can run for days at a time
	___ reuse
	___ share
	___ daemon

    ___ POSIX::RT::Timer as possible replacement for get/set itimer?

    ___ Does anything bad happen when you set $SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE' ?
        'DEFAULT'? sub {} ? undef ?
        _X_ Yes. ANY setting for $SIG{CHLD} will let system calls
	    like  sleep  get interrupted by SIGCHLD events. Maybe.
	    See t/31. 

	    It's curious that we can assign to $XSIG{CHLD}[-1]
	    (which does set a handler for SIGCHLD) but that DOESN'T
	    trigger interruption of system calls. It's as if perl
            is just checking  defined $SIG{CHLD}  instead of whether
	    an actual signal handler is registered to decide whether
	    to interrupt sleep.

	    ___ Setting  $SIG{CHLD}=undef  makes FS subtly wrong, though
                setting  $SIG{CHLD}=\&bogus  is ok. How to keep $SIG{CHLD}
                from getting undefined?
`		___ Override $Signals::XSIG::SIGTie::STORE, ::DELETE ?
		___ Should we periodically set  $SIG{CHLD}=\&garbage?

        ___ Yes again. When $SIG{CHLD}='IGNORE', calling wait or waitpid
	    NEVER returns a pid; it's always either 0 or -1
	    (actually, this is platform dependent).
 	    ___ Should  Forks::Super  check the value of $SIG{CHLD}
	        and emulate this behavior?

        ___ Actually, this would be part of a good XSIG framework workout.
            Some scripts with natural forks and wait/waitpid calls
            should produce the same results with and without Forks::Super
            (i.e., F::S is a drop-in replacement)

        _X_ Test F::S as a drop in replacement to a program that
            has a SIGCHLD handler. -- looks good

    ___ reinstate t/31? ok on Cygwin, MSWin32, Linux, FreeBSD ?
        _X_ still doesn't work on Linux? Sure it does.

    ___ a "wrapper" script that executes an arbitrary command in a
        separate process, but as if it had come from a fork call within
        a program using Forks::Super. The purpose is to make sure that
        a program runs in a detached process. The wrapper will set up
        all the (almost surely file based) IPC and then run the desired
        program. The other purpose is to execute a <XXX>command </XXX>
        subroutine on a remote 	host.

    _O_ are %CHILD_STDxxx variables obsolete? How to deprecate?
        Not obsolete. At least not until we remove the setting
	$Forks::Super::OVERLOAD_ENABLED.

    _o_ setuid =>  option to fork

    _x_ daemon support depends on file-based IPC?
        make a socket-based alternative. Let $job->{signal_ipc}, {daemon_ipc}
	be sockets?

    ___ Anything to learn from python  multiprocessing  module? See   
        stackoverflow.com/questions/7931455/
	_X_ synchronization objects, acquire and release methods
	    ___ perm fix for 48b with sync?
	___ anything else

    ___ exercise every method of FS::Tie::IPCDupSTDIN 
        (__config_fh_child_stdin_file, $job->{fh_config}{f_in},
	sub/natural-style)

    ___ use shared memory between processes, where supported
        ___ synchronization based on shared memory
	___ process pools based on shared memory
        ___ IPC by shared memory
        ___ job queue on shared memory

    ___ encryption and other layers on IO channels

    ___ parent_dump enhancements:
        _X_ get and display stack trace of natural/sub-style children
	___ measure input and output for IPCxxxHandle classes

    ___ CPAN testers find lots of timing errors in openbsd. Is pause(n)
        on openbsd prone to returning significantly more or less than n
	seconds later? Would a busy wait just for openbsd make things
	better or worse?

    _o_ async  method like threads, forks, Coro?
        bg_eval is like the async method

    ___ $job->{child_stdin}, {child_stdout}, {child_xxx} should be
        restructured as $job->{child_fh}{stdin}, {stdout}, etc.
        i.e., a dedicated member that holds a collection of iohandles

    ___ what happens if you mix Forks::Super and forks?
        I'm guessing it's not good.
          meh, it matters less than I thought
            t/forked_harness.pl times out after 30 seconds but tests pass
            regular make test worked?
            t/24e-kill.t does not terminate

    ___ have a "remote_host" option to go with "cmd" option
        _X_ remote_host => host
        _X_ remote_host => [host, user, pwd]
            to run on a remote server that requires some credentials
        _X_ remote_host => [ \@hosts ]  or  [ \@hosts, user, pwd ]
            to run on any of a cluster of available remote hosts
        _X_ allow a separate MAX_PROC-like setting to be used for
            remote hosts
        ___ remote_host_proto => 'ssh'
            default is ssh and requires Net::OpenSSH
            ___ Net::OpenSSH doesn't work on cygwin, MSWin32. Alternatives?
        ___ support remote && dir
        ___ support remote && env

    ___ FS::Config::enable_signal_config not being tested?

    ___ Pool, Queue objects to share data between parent and children (workers)
        ___ Are there existing modules for this? To add and subtract from a
            queue or stack from separate processes?
        _X_ rename Forks::Super::Queue so this package name is available later

    ___ determine in system-limits.PL if alternate alarm is needed
