This should work anyplace File::Spec can split directories, which 
should be anywhere Perl runs.

This may not do much good on Windows: the crazy directory structure 
common to Windows systems do not seem very amenable to using 
$FindBin::Bin as the starting point for locating libraries.

Anyone with access to VMS warn me if this works at all -- through 
judicious use of virtual devices should make it useful.

The pod describes using the module in a few situations, any 
suggestions appreciated. In particular, I toyed with several ways of 
passing in switches. The one used here was chosen because it supports 
qw( ... ) syntax with optional parameters (e.g., qw(export) and 
qw(export=foo)).

Older versions of the module support earlier versions of perl
(see ./versions for list of Perl versions supported). Older
versions of modules are left in the ./versions directory for 
backwards compatibility for anyone stuck on those versions; they
are unmaintained execpt for bugfixes specific to the version.

Installation:

    perl Makefile.PL;
    make all test install;
    perldoc FindBin::libs;

also see ./examples for come common use cases.
