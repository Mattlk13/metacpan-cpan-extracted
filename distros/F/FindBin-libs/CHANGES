-   4.0.4 Fri Oct 25 22:48:57 EDT 2024

    Saner way to add sub-paths; not visible. 

-   4.0.3 Fri Oct 25 22:48:57 EDT 2024

    Add missing '' to catpath. 

    Move canonpath into rel2abs, saves re-running it for each
    directory up the tree. 

-   4.0.2 Fri Oct 25 00:33:15 EDT 2024

    Avoid undef value in m// with defined check.

-   4.0.1 Wed Oct 23 23:03:01 EDT 2024

    Fixes to setup-dist shell script for creating the placeholder
    FindBin/libs.pm file with the correct version.

-   4.0.0 Wed Oct 23 00:59:04 EDT 2024

    Remove all use of abs_path, including FindBin; this will
    now handle symlinks properly using rel2abs.

    Replace FindBin with FindBin::Bin & FindBin::Parents
    modeled after their Raku counterparts.

    Update the test numbers a bit to test the separte modules
    with 0*.t; push tests and MANIFEST into the version dir's.

    Update the dist prepare script to extrac its package 
    line from the installed lib/FindBin/libs.pm so that the
    Makefile.PL can use VERSION_FROM again. 

-   3.0.2 Fri Sep 16 07:45:00 PM EDT 2022

    Bin=X uses dirname( X ) if X is a file, otherwise if X is
    a dir it uses X, otherwise it dies. This mainly simplifies
    testing where libs or config dirs are below the ./t in the
    path. 

-   3.0.1 Thu Feb 24 04:39:00 PM EST 2022

    Remove extraneous breakpoints

-   3.0.0 Thu Feb 24 04:39:00 PM EST 2022

    Rewerite the search to use a saner, multi-stage 
    process. Still uses abs_path to avoid duplicates
    working up the stack due to multi-level symlinks,
    skips things earlier in the process & is a bit 
    easier to read. 

    noignore is handled properly, as is ignore=

    taint extraction on $Bin uses m{^ (.+) /? }x
    to strip the trailing '/' in some RHEL versions
    of catpath. 


-   2.21.0 Mon Mar  8 01:04:13 PM EST 2021

    Minor change in taint extraction: Check for non-whitespace
    in library path after m{ (.+) }x, remove 's' in regex to
    avoid issues with paths including embedded newlines. Up the
    minor number: if anyone really does depend on locating all-
    whitespace paths or ones with embedded newlines warn me.

-   2.20.2 Thu Dec 31 09:38:28 AM EST 2020

    Fix: Revise the 08* test to use generic regexen on non-word 
    directory element separators to deal with MSW inconsistent
    use of them confusing File::Spec::catpath.

    Added die, notes in placeholder lib.pm -- only visible
    when the  Makefile.PL is bypassed and Perl version check
    is skipped.

    Replace VERSION_FROM with VERSION in Makefile.PL to keep release
    info consistent between Perl installation versions.

-   2.20.1 Tue Dec 15 02:32:43 PM EST 2020

    Add ./version/v5.32.1
    Strict is unnecessary in 5.32.
    Test cleanups.
    Use canonpat on subdir and lib args to avoid including
    dir's with '//' in them.

-   2.19.2 Mon May 14 15:23:26 UTC 2018

    Push version out of package declaration since 
    5.8 cannot handle it.

-   2.19.1 Thu May 10 08:12:08 CDT 2018

    Replace the 'v' on v-strings.

-   2.19 Wed May  9 14:21:47 CDT 2018

    Include dummy lib/FindBin/libs.pm in filesystem
    and MANIFEST. This is overwritten by execution of
    Makefile.PL but puts the necessary operatoin into
    the Makefile produced to have the real libs.pm
    copied when necesary.


-   2.18 Wed Apr 25 12:13:34 CDT 2018

    Bump version.


-   2.17.14 Thu Apr 19 00:17:37 CDT 2018

    POD.

    Makefile.PL boilerplate.

    add config_requires.

-   2.17.11 Wed Apr 18 10:46:42 CDT 2018

    Avoid issues with File::Copy::Recursive, see
    rt.cpan.org #125104, which currently breaks
    Module::FromPerlVer.

-   2.17.10 Thu Apr  5 01:57:37 CDT 2018

    Bump version of Module::FromPerlVer

-   2.17.9 Mon Apr  2 12:41:30 CDT 2018

    Missing dependencies in Makefile.PL.

    Bump M::FPV version to 0.3.2.

-   2.17.5 Sun Mar 18 17:19:43 CDT 2018

    Bump dependency version.

-   2.17.4 Sun Mar 18 13:05:04 CDT 2018

    Update Makefile.PL, thanks to Slaven_Rezic.

-   2.17.3 Fri Mar 16 16:32:47 CDT 2018

    Up required version of Module::FromPerlVer.

-   2.17.2 Thu Mar 15 20:25:13 CDT 2018

    Correct version dir path to v5.14 to match "use" value
    in libs.pm.

-   2.17.0 Tue Mar  6 12:49:05 CST 2018

    POD

    Notes on '//' sanity check.


-   2.16.4 Mon Mar  5 22:58:10 CST 2018

    Error in Makefile.PL, remove "::Dir".

-   2.16.3 Mon Mar  5 22:03:52 CST 2018

    Various typos in comments and POD.

    Makefile.PL has explicit version (vs. tracking post-5.8 file).

    Version via version->parse( blah )->numify, makes it simpler 
    to keep versions straight with older perl's that can't handle
    qv-string formats.

    Minor change in CHANGE file format, makes searching for
    releases easier..

-   2.16.2 Sun Mar  4 15:42:32 CST 2018

    Require Cwd 3.73 to avoid issue with infinite recursion in
    abs_path. Hopefully this fixes issues with FB::l croaking
    on sanity check for "abs_path '//'" (RT #124335).

    If this doesn't work I'll have to replace the abs_path check with "-e 
    '/.' && -e '/..'" as test for working abs_path (vs. using rel2abs).

-   2.16.1  Sun Feb 25 16:53:30 CST 2018

    Require Module::FromPerlVer 0.000005, avoids bug in 0.000004 that
    calls the wrong sub to make the source copy.

-   2.16    Sun Feb 25 16:53:30 CST 2018

    Replace various hacks in Makefile.PL with Module::FromPerlVer. At this 
    point there may be multiple versions going forward which use features 
    of Perl after 5.14; older versions will be frozen (aside from bugfixes).

    Note that the new arrangement leaves ./lib out of the tarball: it is 
    created by Module::FromPerlVer from ./version/<appropriate>/lib when 
    Makefile.PL is processed.

    This file is now CHANGES.

-   2.15.02 Tue Jan 30 12:18:00 CST 2018

    use explicit LICENSE key in Extutils metadata.

-   2.15.01 Fri Jan 26 10:10:37 CST 2018

    Add 'same terms as perl 5.24 or any later version' license.

-   2.15    Tue Sep  1 14:33:49 CDT 2015

    Explictly export empty string w/ scalar export if no lib's found
    to avoid undefined variable errors in caller.

    Added test for explicitly looking up non-existant directory and
    exporting it as a scalar.

    Test cleanups.

-   2.14    Tue Sep  1 13:55:19 CDT 2015

    Minor refactoring: Return immediately from import if no lib's are found.

    Minor comment and POD issues.

-   2.13    Thu Jan 15 11:26:45 CST 2015

    Patch old version, thanks to Dominic Humphries.

    Use v5.14 in new version.

-   2.11    Tue Sep  2 13:28:18 CDT 2014

    "append" causes appends array exports from multiple searches using the 
    same variable to append (vs. overwrite) their values. default is old 
    behavior (i.e., "noappend" which overwrites).

    e.g., from t/10*t:

        FindBin::libs->import
        (
            qw
            (
                base=foo
                subdir=etc
                subonly
                export=etc
                append
            )
        );
        FindBin::libs->import
        (
            qw
            (
                base=bar
                subdir=etc
                subonly
                export=etc
                append
            )
        );

    generates:

        # Second pass looks for bar/etc:[
        #   '/sandbox/lembark/Modules/FindBin-libs/foo/etc',
        #   '/sandbox/lembark/Modules/FindBin-libs/bar/etc'
        # ]


    Main use is finding, say, multiple ./etc dir's and exporting
    them all into a search list for config files. 

    Given:

        ./myproj/etc
        ./shared/etc

    then #! code in ./myproj/bin could:

        use FindBin::libs qw( export base=etc                       );    
        use FindBin::libs qw( export base=shared subdir=etc subonly );

    and get @etc of ( .../myproj/etc, .../shared/etc ). 

    The old behavior, 'noappend' overwrites the variable (which can be
    handy for re-setting the dirs also).

-   2.10    Tue Sep  2 10:30:12 CDT 2014

    "scalar" seems to work; update POD so that people know to use it.

-   2.07    Mon Jul 28 02:48:49 CDT 2014

    Try one more time to deal with version issues.

-   2.01    Sat Jul 26 01:52:46 CDT 2014

    Version numbers now come from the current build rather than Makefile.PL.
    Upping the version to v2.00 makes it easier to keep track of it all.
    Makefile uses stringy, .pm uses v-string.
    Hopefully that will keep everyone happy.

    For libs_curr:

    Avoid truncating dirent's with embedded newlines in taint-hack
    by using single-line mode: m{ (.+) }xs

    Add "scalar" option to export the first directory found only as
    a scalar (vs list). Mainly useful with things like config dir's
    where the first one will always be used in any case:

        use FindBin::libs qw( base=etc scalar );

    exports "$etc" rather than "@etc" (saves using $etc[0]
    everyplace). Also works with 

        use FindBin::libs qw( base=etc export=config scalar );

    to export $config rather than an array.

    Added some examples.

    Replace given block to avoid nastygrams from post-5.16 perls.

    Add stub libs.pm as placeholder for version.

    Finally remembered to fix typo (thanks to x.guimard).


    1.11   Wed Jul  2 22:34:00 CDT 2014

    R.I.P. Build.PL.
    see Makefile.PL

    Fix broken assignment of rel2abs from Cwd rather than 
    File::Spec::Functions.

    Add test for abs_path or rel2abs surviving both '//' and 'cwd' --
    if neither of them is available or working the rest of this is
    a waste.

    Note: I don't have access to windows for testing. If any of this
    fails please contact me and we can figure out what is wrong.


    1.9.1   Tue May 27 08:20:41 CDT 2014

    Minor cleanup blows up in 5.12; works in 5.14. Given that 5.20 is
    about to be on the street: the current version is pushed 
    up to 5.14 (i.e., if ref $^V and v5.14 le $^V then the 
    installed version is *_curr, otherwise it is *_5_8).

    1.9     Sat May 24 09:15:15 CDT 2014

    Minor cleanup in handling abs_path replacement.
    Seems to work for people with original issue so this one goes
    on CPAN.


    1.8.1   Sun Mar 23 14:29:44 CDT 2014

    Assign local abs_path rather than shuffle the symbol table after using Cwd.
    Avoids issues with munging symbol table in Cwd itself.

    1.8 Tue May 28 21:04:30 CDT 2013

    Update to work with v5.18

    1.7 Thu Mar 14 15:23:30 GMT 2013

    Up version to 1.7, avoids issues with mutliple dots.

    1.65.2 Tue Feb 19 20:00:27 CST 2013

    Fix tests for Windows (thanks to Alexandr Ciornii 
    for patches).

    1.65.1 Sat Dec 22 22:47:55 CST 2012

    Pod Errors.

    1.65

    Skip unusable tests on windows; use abs_path for
    path checks to avoid symlinks botching the tests.

    Cleanups in libs_curr.pm to use 5.10 features.

    Add "blib" option to prefer "blib" to "lib" at the 
    first level only where blib exists, mainly for use
    in testing.

    1.64

    Update Build.PL to use '0' instead of '>0' for the
    dependencies. 


    1.63 

    Avoid indexing the older version by splitting the
    package name onto a separate line in the source. 


    1.62 Tue Feb 14 14:11:17 EST 2012

    Switch to Module::Build. This allows installing a 
    single file based on $^V of the Perl used for
    installation. This leaves a single "libs.pm" 
    insalled as either the source's 5.8 version or 
    the newer one for 5.10 or later.

    I have no way to test this on Windows or VMS;
    any feedback would be appreciated.

    1.61 Fri Feb 10 11:10:30 EST 2012

    $^V does not compare gracefully prior to 5.10 or
    5.12 (not sure which). Either way, this leaves the
    comparison of $^V useless. Choices are unpack and
    printf or use Config to get the version.

    So... libs.pm now uses Config and version to generate
    comparable objects. 

    1.59 Tue Dec 20 17:05:10 CST 2011

    Fix typo; update tests to expliclty include
    both of the back-end modules.

    1.58 Fri Dec 16 13:06:42 CST 2011

    Hopefully the metadata is un-screwed up enough for
    the thing to succeed at this point.

    1.57 Fri Dec 16 12:26:13 CST 2011

    So much for midnight hacks... simplified
    the test for older versions: libs.pm is
    the current version, libs_5_8.pm is stable
    for the older perl's.

    1.56 Thu Nov 24 10:26:00 CST 2011

    Added "use if $^V < v5.12" to pull in version
    of code useful with v5.8 and later. Basically
    this just puts a rather thin layer in front of
    the older code vs. newer (which will use switches
    for some of the logic, among other things). 

    1.55 Wed Nov 23 16:50:57 CST 2011

    Fix version-string bug in Makefile.PL

    1.54 Wed Nov  9 17:00:09 CST 2011

    OK, seems to make more sense if the code
    uses 5.10, which is still supported.

    1.53 Sun Oct  9 11:02:50 CDT 2011

    oops... should have upped the module version number
    when I upped the Perl version... also makes more sense
    to use v-strings at this point with v5.12.

    1.52 Fri Sep  9 17:10:29 EDT 2011

    Add "realbin" option that bases the lookup on 
    $FindBin::RealBin. This allows a command line
    executable to be symlinked back to wherever it
    lives and find configuration files adjacent
    to the "real" file. This saves having to symlink
    the configuration files next to the symlinked
    executable.

    Up the use to v5.10 now that 5.8 is no longer
    supported.

    1.51    Thu Sep  2 18:26:55 EDT 2010

    Fix MANIFEST.
    Internal changes.

    1.43 Thu Sep  2 12:34:52 EDT 2010

    Fix bug that required use=1 instead of "use" alone in 
    argument processing.

    Add POD for mixing git repositories using git repository
    as base with  ( subdir=lib subonly ).

    1.41 Sat Jun 13 23:02:36 EDT 2009

    Fix errors in tests 06, 07.

    1.40 Wed Jun 10 07:22:48 EDT 2009

    Blindly regex the lib's before returning them
    from find_libs. This avoids issues running 
    tainted.

    1.39 Tue Jun  9 18:14:02 EDT 2009

    Remove an extraneous $DB::single.

    1.38 Tue Jun  9 17:00:29 EDT 2009

    Catch: "-T" doesn't like eval-ed code. 
    Fix:
        require lib;
        lib->import( @lib_dirs )

    It doesn't seem as though lib depends on 
    the caller's namespace, so there isn't
    any harm in calling it this way. Otherwise
    I'll have to find some other way of working
    around -T.


    1.36 Mon Mar 31 19:06:25 EDT 2008

    Add tests for mulitple use or require + multiple
    calls to import. Check that calling import once
    with a subdir followed by a second without any
    arg's still gives the same results (t/0[67]).

    Update Makefile.PL to use 5.00601.

    1.35 Fri Mar 30 13:05:45 EDT 2007

    Add additional check for broken abs_path on W32.

    Update tests to add ./bin for cases where the 

    O/S does not supply one.

    1.34 Thu Mar 29 15:42:26 EDT 2007

    Add block eval for 'abs_path' calls in the 
    sub-dir checks to avoid croaking MS platforms 
    (not an issue for *NIX or VMS that I can tell). 

    1.33 Tue Feb  6 11:40:10 EST 2007

    Add subdir and subonly to look below the ./lib
    dir's for things like ../lib/perl5.

    1.32 Sat Jan 20 15:58:36 EST 2007

    Repair botched MANIFEST

    1.31 Thu Dec  7 14:34:24 EST 2006

    POD

    ./exmaple/p5run sets PERL5LIB and exec's whatever else
    is on the command line.

    MANIFEST cleanups

    1.30 Thu Dec  7 14:34:24 EST 2006

    Added 'p5lib' to prefix the lib's found to $ENV{ PERL5LIB }.

    POD for p5lib, doc cleanups.

    1.26 Tue Aug  1 12:26:13 EDT 2006

- Added Bin argument to allow overriding $FindBin::Bin
      as the root of all evil.

    1.25 Fri Mar  3 08:37:49 EST 2006

- POD: using prove without a blib.

    1.23 Mon Feb 27 12:49:02 EST 2006

- Fix paren bug in catpath.

- Update POD format bugs.

-   1.21 Wed Feb  8 16:20:44 EST 2006

    Trying to fix regex oddity on VMS...

    Use ".+" to untaint $FindBin::Bin instead of "(.+)/?".

-   1.20 Sun Jan 29 19:29:03 EST 2006

    Use File::Spec to split, assemble directory paths. 

    Optinally stub Cwd::abs_path if it failes to resolve
      cwd at startup.

    Replaced test.pl with t/*.t.

    POD

-   1.07 Thu Sep  8 09:33:29 EDT 2005

    RedHat Enterprise Version 4 has a bug that leaves $FindBin::Bin
    with a trailing slash. Fix is to regex it off before using the
    variable.

    Added "debug" argument to set $DB::single = 1 after processing
    the arguments; saves having to hack the code to test where the 
    things come from.

-   1.06 Sat Apr 30 00:24:23 EDT 2005

    Set print to undef -- should've been that way
      to begin with.

-   1.05 Thu Nov  4 17:35:31 EST 2004

    Wrap abs_path in an eval to handle systems that die on
      non-existant directories.

-   1.03 Wed Oct 20 12:03:30 EDT 2004

    Fix doc bug -- added /jowbloe/ below /home on the 
    sandbox examples.

-   1.03 Tue Oct 19 17:13:04 EDT 2004

    Update doc's to include sandbox manglement.

-   1.02 Thu Jun 10 14:26:53 CDT 2004

    Fix typo in version number.

-   1.01 Mon May 31 21:13:13 CDT 2004

    Modify the split for ignored arguments to ignore whitespace
    around the comma separators. This only applies to cases where
    the caller doesn't use qw() for the arguments and ends up 
    with something like: 'ignore=/, /foo'.

    Repair default arg's to successfully ignore '/' and
    '/usr' by default.

    Eval symlink creation to handle systems without symlinks.

    Caveat utilitor: this module has only been tested by me on
    *NIX, the assumed directory separation on '/' is most
    likely broken on ms-dos, VMS, or related filesystems. If
    any currently available *NIX lacks symlinks please warn
    me, otherwise YMMV.

    Cleaned up some comments.

-   1.00 Mon Mar 22 11:18:45 CST 2004

    Up the version number. Thing seems stable enough to call it
    1.00 at this point.

    Reverse the order of CHANGES, with most recent at the top.

-   0.18 Tue Mar 16 22:22:02 CST 2004

    Added -e test before abs_path to avoid nastygrams
    from Cwd on abs_path of dangling links.

-   0.17 Mon Mar  8 23:25:20 CST 2004

    Removed leftover $DB::single (d'oh...)

-   0.16 Sat Jan 24 14:52:23 CST 2004

    Replaced 0 with undef for default print. noprint is
    now the default.

-   0.15 Sat Jan 24 14:46:22 CST 2004

    POD

-   0.14 Wed Dec  3 12:23:42 CST 2003

    Modify Makefile.PL to use ABSTRACT_FROM, NAME entry of POD to 
    add abstract.

    Added notes to README.

    Included test for bogus directory (unless you DO have a 
    ./frobnicatorium) w/ exported array empty.
