0.51    2023-02-08
        [CHANGES]
         * Allow specifying a different class, prototype instance, or
           constructor-like coderef for creating pending Future instances
           (helps with RT146025)
         * Swap all unit tests from `Test::More` to `Test2::V0`

0.50    2023-01-16
        [CHANGES]
         * Optional maximum size; push will return a pending future until
           there's room
         * Added bulk push and shift API for efficiently handling multiple
           items at once
         * Added concept of "finished" queue, where shift returns empty
