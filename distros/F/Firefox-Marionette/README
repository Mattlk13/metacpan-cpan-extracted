DESCRIPTION

    This is a client module to automate the Mozilla Firefox browser via the
    Marionette protocol
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/Protocol>

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new

    accepts an optional hash as a parameter. Allowed keys are below;

      * firefox_binary - use the specified path to the Firefox
      <https://firefox.org/> binary, rather than the default path.

      * capabilities - use the supplied capabilities object, for example to
      set whether the browser should accept insecure certs

      * profile_name - pick a specific existing profile to automate, rather
      than creating a new profile. Note that firefox <https://firefox.com>
      refuses to allow more than one instance of a profile to run at the
      same time.

    This method returns a new Firefox::Marionette object, connected to an
    instance of firefox <https://firefox.com>

 go

    Navigates the current browsing context to the given URI and waits for
    the document to load or the session's page timeout duration to elapse
    before returning. This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods

 uri

    returns the current URI of current top level browsing context for
    Desktop. It is equivalent to the javascript 'document.location.href'

 title

    returns the current title of the window.

 find_element

    returns the first element in the current browsing context that matches
    the search parameters supplied;

      * the first parameter is a scalar search value. This can be an xpath
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath> expression such as
      //button[@name="foo"] to find all button elements that have a 'name'
      of 'foo'.

      * the second optional parameter is a scalar search strategy. This
      defaults to 'xpath'

      This method is subject to the implicit timeout.

 find_elements

    returns the elements in the current browsing context that match the
    search parameters supplied;

      * the first parameter is a scalar search value. This can be an xpath
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath> expression such as
      //button[@name="foo"] to find all button elements that have a 'name'
      of 'foo'.

      * the second optional parameter is a scalar search strategy. This
      defaults to 'xpath'

    This method is subject to the implicit timeout.

 css

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a scalar CSS property
    name as the second parameter. It returns the value of the computed
    style for that property.

 attribute

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a scalar attribute name
    as the second parameter. It returns the value of the attribute with the
    supplied name.

 script

    accepts a scalar containing a javascript function that is executed in
    the browser. Returns the result of the javascript function.

    The executing javascript is subject to the scripts timeout.

 async_script

    accepts a scalar containing a javascript function that is executed in
    the browser. This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

    The executing javascript is subject to the scripts timeout.

 page_source

    returns the page source of the content document.

 context

    returns the context type that is Marionette's current target for
    browsing context scoped commands.

 add_cookie

    accepts a single cookie object as the first parameter and adds it to
    the current cookie jar. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 delete_cookie

    deletes a single cookie by name. Accepts a scalar containing the cookie
    name as a parameter. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 delete_cookies

    here be cookie monsters! This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 cookies

    returns the contents of the cookie jar in scalar or list context.

 send_keys

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a string as the second
    parameter. It sends the string to the specified element in the current
    page, such as filling out a text box. This method returns itself to aid
    in chaining methods.

 is_displayed

    accepts an element as the first parameter. This method returns true or
    false depending on if the element is displayed.

 is_enabled

    accepts an element as the first parameter. This method returns true or
    false depending on if the element is enabled.

 is_selected

    accepts an element as the first parameter. This method returns true or
    false depending on if the element is selected.

 active_element

    returns the active element of the current browsing context's document
    element, if the document element is non-null.

 back

    causes the browser to traverse one step backward in the joint history
    of the current browsing context. The browser will wait for the one step
    backward to complete or the session's page timeout duration to elapse
    before returning. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 forward

    causes the browser to traverse one step forward in the joint history of
    the current browsing context. The browser will wait for the one step
    forward to complete or the session's page timeout duration to elapse
    before returning. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 active_frame

    returns the current active frame if there is one in the current
    browsing context. Otherwise, this method returns undef.

 switch_to_frame

    accepts a frame as a parameter and switches to it within the current
    window.

 switch_to_parent_frame

    set the current browsing context for future commands to the parent of
    the current browsing context

 full_screen

    full screens the firefox window. This method returns itself to aid in
    chaining methods.

 minimise

    minimises the firefox window. This method returns itself to aid in
    chaining methods.

 maximise

    maximises the firefox window. This method returns itself to aid in
    chaining methods.

 refresh

    refreshes the current page. The browser will wait for the page to
    completely refresh or the session's page timeout duration to elapse
    before returning. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 alert_text

    Returns the message shown in a currently displayed modal message box

 dismiss_alert

    dismisses a currently displayed modal message box

 accept_dialog

    accepts a currently displayed modal message box

 send_alert_text

    sends keys to the input field of a currently displayed modal message
    box

 capabilities

    returns the capabilities of the current firefox binary

 screen_orientation

    returns the current browser orientation. This will be one of the valid
    primary orientation values 'portrait-primary', 'landscape-primary',
    'portrait-secondary', or 'landscape-secondary'.

 selfie

    returns a File::Temp object containing a lossless PNG image screenshot.
    If an element is passed as a parameter, the screenshot will be
    restricted to the element.

    If an element is not passed as a parameter and the current context is
    'chrome', a screenshot of the current viewport will be returned.

    If an element is not passed as a parameter and the current context is
    'content', a screenshot of the current frame will be returned.

    The parameters after the element parameter are taken to be a optional
    hash with the following allowed keys;

      * hash - return a SHA256 hex encoded digest of the PNG image rather
      than the image itself

      * full - take a screenshot of the whole document unless the first
      element parameter has been supplied.

      * scroll - scroll to the element supplied

      * highlights - a reference to a list containing elements to draw a
      highlight around

 tag_name

    accepts a Firefox::Marionette::Element object as the first parameter
    and returns the relevant tag name. For example 'a' or 'input'.

 window_rect

    accepts an optional <position and
    size|Firefox::Marionette::Window::Rect> as a parameter, sets the
    current browser window to that position and size and returns the
    previous position, size and state of the browser window. If no
    parameter is supplied, it returns the current position, size and state
    of the browser window.

 rect

    accepts a element as the first parameter and returns the current
    position and size of the element

 text

    accepts a element as the first parameter and returns the text that is
    contained by that element (if any)

 clear

    accepts a element as the first parameter and clears any user supplied
    input

 click

    accepts a element as the first parameter and sends a 'click' to it. The
    browser will wait for any page load to complete or the session's page
    timeout duration to elapse before returning.

 timeouts

    returns the current timeouts for page loading, searching, and scripts.

 new_session

    creates a new WebDriver session. It is expected that the caller
    performs the necessary checks on the requested capabilities to be
    WebDriver conforming. The WebDriver service offered by Marionette does
    not match or negotiate capabilities beyond type and bounds checks.

 window_type

    returns the current window's type. This should be 'navigator:browser'.

 window_handle

    returns the current window's handle. On desktop this typically
    corresponds to the currently selected tab. returns an opaque
    server-assigned identifier to this window that uniquely identifies it
    within this Marionette instance. This can be used to switch to this
    window at a later point.

 window_handles

    returns a list of top-level browsing contexts. On desktop this
    typically corresponds to the set of open tabs for browser windows, or
    the window itself for non-browser chrome windows. Each window handle is
    assigned by the server and is guaranteed unique, however the return
    array does not have a specified ordering.

 accept_connections

    Enables or disables accepting new socket connections. By calling this
    method with `false` the server will not accept any further connections,
    but existing connections will not be forcible closed. Use `true` to
    re-enable accepting connections.

    Please note that when closing the connection via the client you can
    end-up in a non-recoverable state if it hasn't been enabled before.

 current_chrome_window_handle

    see chrome_window_handle.

 chrome_window_handle

    returns an server-assigned integer identifiers for the current chrome
    window that uniquely identifies it within this Marionette instance.
    This can be used to switch to this window at a later point. This
    corresponds to a window that may itself contain tabs.

 chrome_window_handles

    returns identifiers for each open chrome window for tests interested in
    managing a set of chrome windows and tabs separately.

 application_type

    returns the application type for the Marionette protocol. Should be
    'gecko'.

 marionette_protocol

    returns the version for the Marionette protocol. Current most recent
    version is '3'.

 quit

    Marionette will stop accepting new connections before ending the
    current session, and finally attempting to quit the application

DIAGNOSTICS

    Failed to create a socket: %s

      The module was unable to even create a socket. Something is seriously
      wrong with your environment

    Failed to send request to firefox: %s

      The module was unable to perform a syswrite on the socket connected
      to firefox.

    Failed to correctly determined the Firefox process id through the
    initial connection capabilities

      The module was found that firefox is reporting through it's
      Capabilities object a different process id than this module was
      using. This is probably a bug in this module's logic. Please report
      as described in the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section below.
