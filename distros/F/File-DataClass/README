Synopsis

       use File::DataClass::Schema;
    
       $schema = File::DataClass::Schema->new
          ( path    => [ 'path to a file' ],
            result_source_attributes => { source_name => {}, },
            tempdir => [ 'path to a directory' ] );
    
       $schema->source( 'source_name' )->attributes( [ qw( list of attr names ) ] );
       $rs = $schema->resultset( 'source_name' );
       $result = $rs->find( { name => 'id of field element to find' } );
       $result->$attr_name( $some_new_value );
       $result->update;
       @result = $rs->search( { 'attr name' => 'some value' } );

Description

    Provides methods for manipulating structured data stored in files of
    different formats

    The documentation for this distribution starts in the class
    File::DataClass::Schema

    File::DataClass::IO is a Moo based implementation of IO::Alls API. It
    implements the file and directory methods only

Configuration and Environment

    Defines the distributions VERSION number using a polyglot interpreted
    by both Perl and hooks in the VCS

Subroutines/Methods

    None

Diagnostics

    None

Dependencies

    version

Incompatibilities

    On mswin32 and cygwin it is assumed that NTFS is being used and that it
    does not support mtime so caching on those platforms is disabled

    Due to the absence of an mswin32 environment for testing purposes that
    platform is not supported

Bugs and Limitations
