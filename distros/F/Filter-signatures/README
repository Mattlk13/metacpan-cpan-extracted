SEE ALSO

L<perlsub/Signatures>

L<App::sigfix>, which transforms your source code directly between
the different notations without employing a source filter

L<signatures> - a module that doesn't use a source filter but optree
modification instead

L<Sub::Signatures> - uses signatures to dispatch to different subroutines
based on which subroutine matches the signature

L<Method::Signatures> - this module implements subroutine signatures
closer to Perl 6, but requires L<PPI> and L<Devel::Declare>

L<Function::Parameters> - adds two new keywords for declaring subroutines and
parses their signatures. It supports more features than core Perl, closer to
Perl 6, but requires a C compiler and Perl 5.14+.
