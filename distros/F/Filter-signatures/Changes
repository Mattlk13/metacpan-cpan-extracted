    + Support parentheses in default assignments on Perl 5.10 onwards
	    sub foo( $now = time() ) {

0.10 20170628
    + Support multiline signatures
	. We also attempt to keep the line numbers correct

0.09 20170116
    + Support single-line functions
      In fact, we simply don't require the subroutine declaration to be on a
      separate line from other code.
      This adresses RT #119843

    + Actually allow for empty parameter lists
    + Allow for unnamed/ignored parameters sub ($foo,$,$bar) { ... }
    . Adresses Github issue #1

    + Don't crash on empty function parameter lists.
	+ Make module internals more testable
	. Add a test that verifies function default parameters actually parse
	  as we expect. Thanks to Rolf Langsdorf for the discussion.

    . Bump Filter::Simple prerequisite to 0.91
      Earlier versions gave problems with some of my modules
      If it works for you, no need to upgrade

0.04 20160906
    + Add support for defaults, and our own, very, _very_
      simplicistic "expression parser" (which blindly splits on comma.
      This means that the following is now supported:
        sub foo( $bar, $baz='default' ) {
          return $baz
        };
        print foo("two","parameters"); # parameters
        print foo("one");              # default

      The following will still fail horribly, because we don't parse expressions:
        sub foo( $bar, $baz=bar(1,2) ) {
          print $baz # "default"
        };

0.03 20160519
    + Add our own fake 'experimental::signatures' warning category
      if we install our filter so that "no warnings 'experimental::signatures'"
      doesn't raise an error on Perl versions where we install our filter

0.02 20160423
    + Check does now not use the version of Perl but checks
      `use feature 'signatures'`
    + You can force the use of the module using an environment variable
      (not that you should)
