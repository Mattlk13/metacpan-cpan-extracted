NAME
    "Future::AsyncAwait::Frozen" - deferred subroutine syntax for futures

SYNOPSIS
       use Future::AsyncAwait::Frozen;

       async sub do_a_thing
       {
          my $first = await do_first_thing();

          my $second = await do_second_thing();

          return combine_things( $first, $second );
       }

       do_a_thing()->get;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is merely a frozen release of Future::AsyncAwait to test
    experimental async/await support in Mojolicious. Just the namespace has
    been changed. All code belongs to the original authors.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    With thanks to "Zefram", "ilmari" and others from "irc.perl.org/#p5p"

    Thanks to "genio" for project management and actually reminding me to
    write some code.

    Thanks to The Perl Foundation for sponsoring me to continue working on
    the implementation.
