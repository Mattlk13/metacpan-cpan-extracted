File-TVShow-Info

This module is a reworking of Video::Filename. This module will work with TV
Shows only and does not support identifying movies.

It has enhanced support for identifying Episode names and other attributes.

need these values as integers, please call the {attr}_to_int functions or
manually cast the output.
