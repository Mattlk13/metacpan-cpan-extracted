     if ($res) {
         printf "File is an executable (type: %s, ext: %s)\n",

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  check_executable_filename
    Usage:

     check_executable_filename(%args) -> bool|hash

    Check whether filename indicates being an executable program/script.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.pm"); # -> [200, "OK", 0, {}]

    *   Example #2:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.appimage");

        Result:

         [
           200,
           "OK",
           { exec_ext => ".appimage", exec_name => "foo", exec_type => "appimage" },
           {},
         ]

    *   Case-insensitive by default:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.Appimage");

        Result:

         [
           200,
           "OK",
           { exec_ext => ".Appimage", exec_name => "foo", exec_type => "appimage" },
           {},
         ]

    *   Case-sensitive:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.Appimage", ci => 0); # -> [200, "OK", 0, {}]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to match case-insensitively.

    *   filename* => *str*

    Return value: (bool|hash)

    Return false if no archive suffixes detected. Otherwise return a hash of
    information, which contains these keys: "exec_type", "exec_ext",
    "exec_name".
