NAME

    Future::IO::Impl::Glib - implement Future::IO using Glib

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an implementation for Future::IO which uses Glib.
    This is likely the preferred method of providing the API from Glib or
    Gtk programs.

    There are no additional methods to use in this module; it simply has to
    be loaded, and will provide the Future::IO implementation methods:

       use Future::IO;
       use Future::IO::Impl::Glib;
    
       my $f = Future::IO->sleep(5);
       ...
