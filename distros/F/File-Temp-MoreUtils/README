NAME
    File::Temp::MoreUtils - Provide more routines related to creating
    temporary files/dirs

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of File::Temp::MoreUtils (from
    Perl distribution File-Temp-MoreUtils), released on 2021-07-20.

SYNOPSIS
FUNCTIONS
  tempdir_named
    Usage:

     tempdir_named(%args) -> any

    Try to create a temporary directory with certain name (but used .1, .2,
    ... suffix if already exists) .

    Examples:

    *   Attempt to create /foo/source.dir/, and if already exists
        /foo/source.1.dir/ instead, and so on:

         tempdir_named(name => "/foo/source.dir");

    *   Attempt to create source/ inside another temporary directory, and if
        already exists source.1/, and so on:

         tempdir_named(name => "source", dir => undef);

    *   Attempt to create source.dir/, and if already exists
        source.tmp1.dir/, then source.tmp2.pdf, and so on:

         tempdir_named(name => "source.dir", suffix_start => "tmp1");

    This is similar to "tempfile_named()", but since there is no "O_EXCL"
    flag similar to opening a file, there is a race condition possible where
    you create a certain temporary directory and before you open/read the
    directory, someone else has replaced the directory with another.
    Therefore it is best if you create the specifically-named temporary
    directory *inside* another temporary directory.

    Like File::Temp's "tempdir()", it will return the path of the created
    temporary directory:

     $dir

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dir => *dirname*

        If specified, will create the temporary directory here.

        If specified and set to "undef", will create new temporary directory
        using File::Temp's "tempdir" (with CLEANUP option set to true unless
        DEBUG environment variable is set to true) and use this temporary
        directory for the directory, including for subsequent invocation for
        the same process whenever "dir" is set to "undef" again.

    *   name* => *filename*

    *   suffix_start => *str* (default: 1)

        Will use Perl's post-increment operator ("++") to increment the
        suffix, so this works with number as well as letter combinations,
        e.g. "aa" will be incremented to "ab", "ac" and so on.

    Return value: (any)

  tempfile_named
    Usage:

     tempfile_named(%args) -> any

    Try to create a temporary file with certain name (but used .1, .2, ...
    suffix if already exists) .

    Examples:

    *   Attempt to create source.pdf, and if already exists source.1.pdf,
        and so on:

         tempfile_named(name => "source.pdf");

    *   Attempt to create source.pdf in a temporary directory, and if
        already exists source.1, and so on:

         tempfile_named(name => "source", dir => undef);

    *   Attempt to create source.pdf, and if already exists source.tmp1.pdf,
        then source.tmp2.pdf, and so on:

         tempfile_named(name => "source.pdf", suffix_start => "tmp1");

    Unlike File::Temp's "tempfile()" which creates a temporary file with a
    unique random name, this routine tries to create a temporary file with a
    specific name, but adds a counter suffix when the specified name already
    exists. Care has been taken to avoid race condition (using "O_EXCL" flag
    of "sysopen"). This is often desirable in the case when we want the
    temporary file to have a name similarity with another file.

    And like File::Temp's "tempfile()", will return:

     ($fh, $filename)

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dir => *dirname*

        If specified, will create the temporary file here.

        If specified and set to "undef", will create new temporary directory
        using File::Temp's "tempdir" (with CLEANUP option set to true unless
        DEBUG environment variable is set to true) and use this temporary
        directory for the directory, including for subsequent invocation for
        the same process whenever "dir" is set to "undef" again.

    *   name* => *filename*

    *   suffix_start => *str* (default: 1)

        Will use Perl's post-increment operator ("++") to increment the
        suffix, so this works with number as well as letter combinations,
        e.g. "aa" will be incremented to "ab", "ac" and so on.

    Return value: (any)
