VERSION

    (from Perl distribution Finance-SE-IDX-Static), released on 2021-01-18.

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    This module is the static (offline) version of Finance::SE::IDX. It
    provides the same functions and arguments, but the data is cached in the
    source code. It is useful as a fallback when the source that
    Finance::SE::IDX uses is unavailable. As a consequence, the data will be
    somewhat out of date.
