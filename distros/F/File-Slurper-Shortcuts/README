NAME
    File::Slurper::Shortcuts - Some convenience additions for File::Slurper

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of File::Slurper::Shortcuts (from
    Perl distribution File-Slurper-Shortcuts), released on 2021-08-02.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Slurper::Shortcuts qw(modify_text modify_binary);
     modify_text("dist.ini", sub { s/One/Two/ });

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  modify_text
    Usage:

     $orig_content = modify_text($filename, $code, $encoding, $crlf);

    This is File::Slurper's "read_text" and "write_text" combined. First,
    "read_text" is performed then the content of file is put into $_. Then
    $code will be called and should modify $_ to modify the content of file.
    Finally, "write_text" is called to write the new content. If content
    ($_) does not change, file will not be written.

    If file can't be read with "read_text()" an exception will be thrown by
    File::Slurper.

    This function will also die if code does not return true.

    If file can't be written with "write_text()" an exception will be thrown
    by File::Slurper.

    Return the original content of file.

    Note that no locking is performed and file is opened twice, so there
    might be race condition etc.
