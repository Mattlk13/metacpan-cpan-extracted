NAME
    File::Slurper::Shortcuts - Some convenience additions for File::Slurper

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of File::Slurper::Shortcuts (from
    Perl distribution File-Slurper-Shortcuts), released on 2018-09-22.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Slurper::Shortcuts qw(replace_text replace_binary);
     replace_text("dist.ini", sub { s/One/Two/ });

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  replace_text
    Usage:

     replace_text($filename, $code, $encoding, $crlf);

    This is like File::Slurper's "write_text" except that instead of
    $content in the second argument, this routine accepts $code. Code should
    modify $_ (which contains the content of the file) and return true. This
    routine will die if: file can't be read with "read_text()", code does
    not return true, file can't be written to with "write_text()".
