NAME
    File::Truncate::Undoable - Truncate a file, with undo support

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.05 of File::Truncate::Undoable (from
    Perl distribution File-Truncate-Undoable), released on 2017-07-10.

FUNCTIONS
  truncate
    Usage:

     truncate(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Truncate a file, with undo support.

    On do, will trash file then create an empty file (with the same
    permission and ownership as the original). On undo, will trash the new
    file and untrash the old file.

    Note: chown will not be done if we are not running as root. Symlink is
    currently not permitted.

    Fixed state: file exists and size is not zero.

    Fixable state: file exists and size is not zero.

    Unfixable state: file does not exist or path is not a regular file
    (directory and symlink included).

    This function is not exported.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   path* => *str*

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
