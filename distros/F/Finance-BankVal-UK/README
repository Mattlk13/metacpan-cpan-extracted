  $ans = bankValUK('01-01-01','12345678');

  ===================== or for OO ========================

DESCRIPTION

This module handles all of the restful web service calls to Unified Software's
BankValUK service. It also handles fail over to the back up services transparently to the
calling script. It can be called either in a procedural sense or an OO one (see synopsis)

The exposed method &bankValUK(); takes a number of parameters including;

1: Sort code	- 6 digit number either 00-00-00, 00 00 00 or 000000

2: Account no.	- 6 to 12 digit (unseparated i.e. 00000000)

3: UserID	- available from www.unifiedsoftware.co.uk

4: PIN		- available from www.unifiedsoftware.co.uk

(UserID and PIN are available from https://www.unifiedsoftware.co.uk/request-a-free-trial/)

The order of the parameters MUST be as above.
The UserID and PIN can also be stored in the LoginConfig.txt file bundled with this module, the
use of this file saves passing the PIN and user ID data with each call to bankValUK.
For example a call to validate a UK bank account passing the user ID and PIN as parameters
and printing the reply to console should follow this form:

=====================================================================

 #!/usr/bin/perl

 use Finance::BankVal::UK qw(&bankValUK);

 my $ans = bankValUK('01-02-03','12345678','xmpl123','12345');

 print $ans;

=====================OR for Object Orientation=======================

 use Finance::BankVal::UK

 my $bvObj = Finance::BankVal::UK->new();
 my $ans = $bvObj->bankValUK('01-02-03','12345678','xmpl123','12345');

 print $ans;

=====================================================================

valid parameter lists are:-

bankValUK('$sortcode','$account_no','$userID','$PIN');

bankValUK('$sortcode','$account_no');

n.b. the last parameter list requires that the user ID and PIN are stored
in the LoginConfig.txt file bundled with this module.


EXPORT

Nothing is exported by default.
&bankValUK is exported on request i.e. "use Finance::BankVal::UK qw(&bankValUK);"
