NAME
    Finance::SE::IDX - Get information from Indonesian Stock Exchange

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of Finance::SE::IDX (from Perl
    distribution Finance-SE-IDX), released on 2021-01-18.

FUNCTIONS
  get_idx_daily_trading_summary
    Usage:

     get_idx_daily_trading_summary(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Get daily trading summary.

    This will retrieve end-of-day data for a single trading day, containing
    list of stock names along with their opening price, closing price,
    highest price, lowest price, volume, frequency, foreign buy & sell
    volume, etc.

    To specify date you can either specify "date" (epoch, or YYYY-MM-DD
    string in command-line, which will be coerced to epoch) or "day",
    "month", "year".

    The data for still-trading current day will not be available, so if you
    are looking for intraday data, this is not it.

    At the time of this writing (2021-01-17), the data goes back to Jan 1st,
    2015. If you are looking for older data, you can visit one of the
    financial data websites like Bloomberg.
