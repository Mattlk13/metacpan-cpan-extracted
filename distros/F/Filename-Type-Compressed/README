DESCRIPTION

         check_compressed_filename(filename => "foo.bar"); # -> 0

    *   Example #2:

         check_compressed_filename(filename => "baz.xz");

        Result:

         {
           compressor_name       => "XZ",

           uncompressed_filename => "baz",
         }

    *   Example #3:

         check_compressed_filename(filename => "qux.Bz2");

        Result:

         {
           compressor_name       => "Bzip2",
           compressor_suffix     => ".Bz2",
           uncompressed_filename => "qux",
         }

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
