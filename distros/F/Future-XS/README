NAME

    Future::XS - experimental XS implementation of Future

SYNOPSIS

       my $future = Future::XS->new;
    
       perform_some_operation(
          on_complete => sub {
             $future->done( @_ );
          }
       );
    
       $future->on_ready( sub {
          say "The operation is complete";
       } );

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an XS-based implementation of the Future class. It
    is currently experimental and shipped in its own distribution for
    testing purposes, though once it seems stable the plan is to move it
    into the main Future distribution and load it automatically in favour
    of the pureperl implementation on supported systems.
