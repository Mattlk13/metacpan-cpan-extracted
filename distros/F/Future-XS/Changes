         * Many other small refcount-related bugfixes

0.07    2022-12-06
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Ensure that `$f->retain` on a completed Future::XS returns the

        [CHANGES]
         * Implement remaining bits of API and behaviour in order to make the
           full set of Future dist tests pass
