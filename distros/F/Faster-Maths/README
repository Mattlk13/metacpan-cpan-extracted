NAME

    Faster::Maths - make mathematically-intense programs faster

SYNOPSIS

       use Faster::Maths;
    
       # and that's it :)

DESCRIPTION

    This module installs an optimizer into the perl compiler that looks for
    sequences of maths operations that it can make faster.

    When this module is lexically in scope, mathematical expressions
    composed of the four basic operators (+, -, *, /) operating on lexical
    variables and constants will be compiled into a form that is more
    efficient at runtime.

TODO

      * Recognise more potential arguments - padrange and package variables
      at least.

      * Recognise more operators - %, unary - and sqrt, possibly other
      unary operators like sin.

      * Recognise the presence of overloading magic on variables and fall
      back to slower-but-correct operation in that case.

      * Split the runtime loop into IV/UV/NV cases, further optimise the
      accumulator value in each case.

      * Store IV/UV constants as values directly in the UNOP_AUX structure
      avoiding the need for SV lookup on them.

      * Back-compatibility to perls older than 5.22.0 by providing an
      UNOP_AUX implementation.
