0.08 2016-06-27T19:49:09Z

    - Updating several examples due to API changes and (mostly) lazy bugs
    - Though meaningless for market orders, the 'price' value is now required by the API
        If it's missing in your call to ::Order->new(...), quote data is requested for
        the instrument and the current bid price is used.

0.07 2016-05-29T20:46:30Z

	- Historical quotes correctly request a defined span
