Revision history for Perl extension File::Append::TempFile.

0.07	2015/11/16
	- switch from META.yml to META.json
	- remove the $Ringlet version control tags
	- rename the test files dropping the File-Append-Tempfile prefix
	- drag the Perl source kicking and screaming into the Century of
	  the Fruitbat:
	  - bump the minimum Perl version to 5.010
	  - use barewords as hash indices whenever possible
	  - do not use parentheses unless really needed
	  - convert the tests to use Test::More
	  - use File::Temp for the handling of temporary files
	- do not attempt to examine the return value of Pod::Checker's
	  parse_from_file() method - it is not documented to return
	  anything, and the return value seems to be a bit unreliable
	  across Perl installations.  Let's just hope it dies on error.
	  This should take care of RT#108984.
	- switch to Module::Build::Tiny
