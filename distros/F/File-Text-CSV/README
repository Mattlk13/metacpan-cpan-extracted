File-Text-CSV

Text::Text::CSV is like many other CSV processing modules, but it
focuses on the file side.

CSV data is a file data format, so in practice one has to work with a
file, reading lines, then unpacking the data from the lines using some
other module, and so on. This module combines all that.

It uses Text::CSV_XS to handle the CSV details.
