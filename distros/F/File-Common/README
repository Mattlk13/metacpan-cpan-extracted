DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  list_common_files
    Usage:

     list_common_files(%args) -> any

    List files that are found in {all,more than one} directories.

    This routine lists files that are found in all specified directories
    (or, when "min_occurrences" option is specified, files that are found in
    at least a certain number of occurrences. Note that only filenames are
    compared, not content/checksum. Directories are excluded.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

        Whether to return detailed result per file.

        If set to true, instead of an array of filenames:

         ["file1", "file2"]

        it will instead return a hash with filename as key and another hash
        containing detailed information:

         {
             "file1" => {
                 dirs => ["dir1", "dir2"], # in which dirs the file is found
             },
             "file2" => {
                 ...
             },
         }

    *   dirs* => *array[dirname]*

    *   min_occurrence => *posint*

    Return value: (any)
