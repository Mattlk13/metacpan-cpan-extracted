File::Same

The README  is  used  to  introduce the module and provide instructions on how to
install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for example C compilers
and installed libraries) and any other information that should be provided before
the module is installed.

A  README  file  is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README file
from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive can use it to  get
an  idea  of  the  module's  uses.  It  is usually a good idea to provide version
information here so that people can decide whether fixes for the module are worth
downloading.

DESCRIPTION

File::Same allows  you  to compare a whole bunch of files (or directories full of
files) for "sameness".

Essentially this  was written to detect which files in a multitude of directories
are the same, and allow us to do further processing on those files.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Replace make for nmake on Win32.

    Digest::MD5
    File::Spec (included with core perl)
