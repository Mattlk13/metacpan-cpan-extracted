NAME
    Finance::SE::IDX::Any - Get information from Indonesian Stock Exchange

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of Finance::SE::IDX::Any (from
    Perl distribution Finance-SE-IDX-Any), released on 2021-08-01.

SYNOPSIS
    Use like you would use Finance::SE::IDX.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the same functions as Finance::SE::IDX, e.g.
    "list_idx_firms", and will call the Finance::SE::IDX version but will
    fallback for a while (default: 4 hours) to the Finance::SE::IDX::Static
    version when the functions fail.

VARIABLES
  $FALLBACK_PERIOD
    Specify, in seconds, how long should the fallback (static) version be
    used after a failure. Default is 4*3600 (4 hours).

FUNCTIONS
  get_idx_daily_trading_summary
    Usage:

     get_idx_daily_trading_summary(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Get daily trading summary.

    This will retrieve end-of-day data for a single trading day, containing
    list of stock names along with their opening price, closing price,
    highest price, lowest price, volume, frequency, foreign buy & sell
    volume, etc.

    To specify date you can either specify "date" (epoch, or YYYY-MM-DD
    string in command-line, which will be coerced to epoch) or "day",
    "month", "year".

    The data for still-trading current day will not be available, so if you
    are looking for intraday data, this is not it.

    At the time of this writing (2021-01-17), the data goes back to Jan 1st,
    2015. If you are looking for older data, you can visit one of the
    financial data websites like Bloomberg.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   date => *date*

    *   day => *int*

    *   month => *int*

    *   year => *int*

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  list_idx_boards
    Usage:

     list_idx_boards() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List boards.

    By default caches results for 8 hours (by locally setting
    CACHE_MAX_AGE). Can be overriden by using HTTP_TINY_CACHE_MAX_AGE.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    No arguments.
