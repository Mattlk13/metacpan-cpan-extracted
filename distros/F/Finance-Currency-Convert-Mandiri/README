FUNCTIONS
  convert_currency
    Usage:

     convert_currency($n, $from, $to, $which) -> any

    Convert currency using Bank Mandiri.

    Currently can only handle conversion "to" IDR. Dies if given other
    currency.

    Will warn if failed getting currencies from the webpage.

    Currency rate is not cached (retrieved from the website every time).
    Employ your own caching.

    Will return undef if no conversion rate is available for the requested
    currency.

    Use "get_currencies()", which actually retrieves and scrapes the source
    web page, if you need the more complete result.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   $from* => *str*

    *   $n* => *float*

    *   $to* => *str*

    *   $which => *str* (default: "avg_sr")

        Select which rate to use (default is average buy+sell for e-Rate).

        {buy,sell,avg}_{bn,er,ttc}.

    Return value: (any)

  get_currencies
    Usage:

     get_currencies() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Extract data from Bank Mandiri page.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

    Will return a hash containing key "currencies".

    The currencies is a hash with currency symbols as keys and prices as
    values.

    Tha values is a hash with these keys: "buy_bn" and "sell_bn" (Bank Note
    buy/sell rates), "buy_sr" and "sell_sr" (Special Rate buy/sell rates),
    "buy_ttc" and "sell_ttc" (Telegraphic Transfer Counter buy/sell rates).

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
