     if ($res) {
         printf "File is an executable (type: %s, ext: %s)\n",

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  check_executable_filename
    Usage:

     check_executable_filename(%args) -> bool|hash

    Check whether filename indicates being an executable program/script.

    Examples:

    *   Example #1:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.pm"); # -> 0

    *   Example #2:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.appimage");

        Result:

         { exec_ext => ".appimage", exec_name => "foo", exec_type => "appimage" }

    *   Case-insensitive by default:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.Appimage");

        Result:

         { exec_ext => ".Appimage", exec_name => "foo", exec_type => "appimage" }

    *   Case-sensitive:

         check_executable_filename(filename => "foo.Appimage", ci => 0); # -> 0

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to match case-insensitively.

    *   filename* => *str*

        (No description)

    Return value: (bool|hash)

    Return false if no archive suffixes detected. Otherwise return a hash of
    information, which contains these keys: "exec_type", "exec_ext",
    "exec_name".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
