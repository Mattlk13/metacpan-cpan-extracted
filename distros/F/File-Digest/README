NAME
    File::Digest - Calculate digests of files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.010 of File::Digest (from Perl
    distribution File-Digest), released on 2019-09-12.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Digest qw(digest_files);

     my $res = digest_files(
         files => ["file1", "file2"],
         algorithm => 'md5', # default md5, available also: crc32, sha1, sha256
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides some convenience when you want to use Digest
    against files.

FUNCTIONS
  digest_file
    Usage:

     digest_file(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Calculate digest of file.

    Return 400 status when algorithm is unknown/unsupported.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str* (default: "md5")

    *   digest_args => *array[str]*

    *   file* => *filename*

        Filename ("-" means stdin).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  digest_files
    Usage:

     digest_files(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Calculate digests of files.

    Dies when algorithm is unsupported/unknown.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str* (default: "md5")

    *   digest_args => *array[str]*

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

        Array of filenames (filename "-" means stdin).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

    original files.
