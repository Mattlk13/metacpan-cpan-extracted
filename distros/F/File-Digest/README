NAME
    File::Digest - Calculate file checksum/digest (using various algorithms)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.008 of File::Digest (from Perl
    distribution File-Digest), released on 2019-08-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Digest qw(digest_files);

     my $res = digest_files(
         files => ["file1", "file2"],
         algorithm => 'md5', # default md5, available also: crc32, sha1, sha256
     );

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  digest_file
    Usage:

     digest_file(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Calculate file checksum/digest (using various algorithms).

    Return 400 status when algorithm is unknown/unsupported.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str* (default: "md5")

    *   file* => *filename*

        Filename ("-" means stdin).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  digest_files
    Usage:

     digest_files(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Calculate file checksum/digest (using various algorithms).

    Dies when algorithm is unsupported/unknown.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   algorithm => *str* (default: "md5")

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

        Array of filenames (filename "-" means stdin).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

    file e.g. MD5SUMS.
