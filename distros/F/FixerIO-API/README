DESCRIPTION
    This is a Perl module for accessing the API provided by fixer.io. See,
    "http://fixer.io/documentation".

    This module doesn't export anything. Nor does it keep any data, other
    than your API access key. Your script will keep or do what it wants with
    the data.

    You have to obtain your own API key from the fixer.io web site. There is
    a free option.

IMPLEMENTED ENDPOINTS
    Please note that depending on your subscription plan, certain API
    endpoints may not be available.

  LATEST RATES
    Returns real-time exchange rate data for all available or a specific set
    of currencies.

    Specifying symbols is not implemented. Changing the base is not
    implemented. The etags optimization is not implemented.

EXPORT
    No exports.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Instantiate a new API access object. Pass in your API access key as an
    argument.

  api_call
    Perform the HTTP(S) request, return the response data.

  latest
