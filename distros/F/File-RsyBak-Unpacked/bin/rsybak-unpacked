=head1 NAME

rsybak-unpacked - Backup files/directories with histories, using rsync

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.29 of rsybak-unpacked (from Perl distribution File-RsyBak-Unpacked), released on 2015-10-22.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % rsybak-unpacked [options] <source> <target>

Examples:

 % rsybak-unpacked /home/jajang/mydata /backup/jajang/mydata
 ERROR 500: Error: Can't create target directory : No such file or directory

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C rsybak-unpacked rsybak-unpacked

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete rsybak-unpacked 'p/*/`rsybak-unpacked`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 RSYBAK_UNPACKED_OPT => str

Specify additional command-line options

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration file, which by default is searched at C<~/.config/rsybak-unpacked.conf>, C<~/rsybak-unpacked.conf> or C</etc/rsybak-unpacked.conf> (can be changed by specifying C<--config-path>). All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

Configuration file is in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features. 

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

List of available configuration parameters:

 backup (see --no-backup)
 extra_dir (see --extra-dir)
 extra_rsync_opts (see --extra-rsync-opts)
 format (see --format)
 format_options (see --format-options)
 histories (see --histories)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)
 rotate (see --no-rotate)
 source (see --source)
 target (see --target)

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format-options>=I<s>

Pass options to formatter.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Equivalent to --format=json-pretty.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--extra-dir>

Whether to force creation of source directory in target.

If set to 1, then backup(source => '/a', target => '/backup/a') will create
another 'a' directory in target, i.e. /backup/a/current/a. Otherwise, contents
of a/ will be directly copied under /backup/a/current/.

Will always be set to 1 if source is more than one, but default to 0 if source
is a single directory. You can set this to 1 to so that behaviour when there is
a single source is the same as behaviour when there are several sources.


=item B<--extra-rsync-opts-json>=I<s>

Pass extra options to rsync command (JSON-encoded).

See C<--extra-rsync-opts>.

=item B<--extra-rsync-opts-yaml>=I<s>

Pass extra options to rsync command (YAML-encoded).

See C<--extra-rsync-opts>.

=item B<--extra-rsync-opts>=I<s@>

Pass extra options to rsync command.

Extra options to pass to rsync command when doing backup. Note that the options
will be shell quoted, , so you should pass it unquoted, e.g. ['--exclude',
'/Program Files'].


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--histories-json>=I<s>

Histories/history levels (JSON-encoded).

See C<--histories>.

=item B<--histories-yaml>=I<s>

Histories/history levels (YAML-encoded).

See C<--histories>.

=item B<--histories>=I<s@>

Histories/history levels.

Default value:

 [-7,4,3]

Specifies number of backup histories to keep for level 1, 2, and so on. If
number is negative, specifies number of days to keep instead (regardless of
number of histories).


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--no-backup>

If backup=1 and rotate=0 then will only create new backup without rotating
histories.


=item B<--no-rotate>

If backup=0 and rotate=1 then will only do history rotating.


=item B<--source>=I<s>*

Director(y|ies) to backup.

=item B<--target>=I<s>*

Backup destination.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back
