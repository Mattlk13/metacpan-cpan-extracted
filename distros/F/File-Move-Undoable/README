FAQ

 Why do you use rsync? Why not, say, File::Copy::Recursive?

    With rsync, we can continue interrupted transfer. We need this ability
    for recovery. Also, rsync can handle hardlinks and preservation of
    ownership, something which File::Copy::Recursive currently does not do.
    And, being implemented in C, it might be faster when processing large
    files/trees.
