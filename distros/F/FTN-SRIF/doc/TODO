To Do
======

- Add test scripts for testing the module itself.

- Add FTN::SRIF::Tutorial

- Move doc/TODO to lib/FTN/SRIF/ToDo.pod

- Add example doc/binkd.srf to FTN::SRIF::Tutorial.

- Move TEST::* modules to BUILD_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL

- Move contents of bin/sriftst.sh to FTN::SRIF::Tutorial as an example.

- Add a reference to the ftsc.org site for the SRIF documentation.

- Whitespace/tags cleanup in both the module and the script.

- Subroutines need to end with a return(); add that line to the subroutines as
  they are being moved from the script to the module, and add in place to any
  subroutines not being moved.

- Add a note to the README regarding the need for Config::Tiny.


lib/FTN/SRIF.pm
----------------
- Add documentation of the 'Perl for FTN Systems' project at SourceForge.

- Does reading the Sysop field require needing to allow more than one space?

- Move subroutines from ftn-srif script to FTN::SRIF module? (send_response,
send_default_file, send_packet_response?)

- Need tp be able to allow for blank or empty lines at the end of an SRIF file
that is being parsed; currently it comes up with an error message about an the
'$keyword' variable being undefined at line 222 of the file reading loop.


bin/ftn-srif
-------------

- Add an explicit exit() to the main body of the code.

- Log the lines that are being requested.

- Create a results message as a text file.

- Use "freqerr.txt" as a paragraph to be included in the results message,
to indicate files that could not be found, instead of it being an entire
msg?   Or as part of a response sentance for each file requested?

- Read through a magic file list (magic.txt) for matches, & send any files
found. If not found there, search through an okfiles.txt file for the
file being requested.

- Add a configurable option to return an FTN packet file instead of just
the default of sending the results message back as a text file. Make it
a call using FTN::Packet or FTN::Pkt for creating the packet.

- Add a configurable option to set the logging ID ($log_id)?

- Add a configurable option to save a copy of the SRIF if debug is set?

- Add a configurable option to log the command line if debug is set?

- Set debug option in configuration file instead of in script.  Default to set?

- Getting an extra newline (at least on a Linux system) when logging the name
of the request file, when logging that the request file is being read, and when
logging the name of the response file.

- The removal of the request file is apparantly not working but there is no
error being generated either.

- Rename to reflect that it is an SRIF processor explicitly for file requests?


Testing
-------

- Add extra lines to the requests file t/FTN/00000001.REQ and add code to
t/03-RequestList.t test for those lines.

- Add a check of an environmental variable like RELEASE_DEBUGGING to enable
  things like the use of Data::Dumper in the test scripts.
