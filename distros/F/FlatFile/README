FlatFile

"FlatFile" is a class for manipulating flat-file (plain text) databases.
One first opens the database, obtaining a database object. Queries may be
perfomed on the database object, yielding record objects, which can be
queried to retrieve information from the database. If the database is
writable, the objects can be updated, and the updates written back to the
file.

Subclasses of this module can be created to represent specific files,
such as the Unix password file or the Account Management "db.list" file.
