Net::OAuth2Server

A server-side OAuth2 framework with the following aims:

* Well designed for direct use as-is within a web application

  Application programmers should have a reasonable abstraction to build
  on so they can fill in the specifics of their application without
  having to reimplement significant parts of the protocol anyway.

* Extensible enough as a framework to implement any OAuth2 extension

  It should be possible to implement any OAuth2 extension such that it
  can easily be shipped as a CPAN module.

* Independent from specific web frameworks

  It should not be necessary to reimplement OAuth2 as a plugin or
  extension for every single framework.

* Frugal in dependencies and means of implementation

  OAuth2 is not deep or clever technology, it is glue. There is no need
  for anything deep or clever in an implementation of it.
