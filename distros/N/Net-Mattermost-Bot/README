Net-Mattermost-Bot version 0.03
===============================

A base class for Mattermost bots. Provides a websocket connection and basic API
controls for creating a simple Mattermost bot.

Several methods are provided which may be overridden in your own bot:

    - event_connected() - The bot connected to the chat server ($self).
    - event_typing() - Someone started typing ($self, $args).
    - event_channel_viewed() - A channel was viewed ($self, $args).
    - event_posted() - A message was posted to a channel ($self, $args).
    - event_generic() - Catch-all for other events ($self, $args).

    Extend Net::Mattermost::Bot in a C<Moo> or C<Moose> package.

    my $bot = Local::MyBot->new({
        username  => 'username here',
        password  => 'password here',
        team_name => 'team name here',
        base_url  => 'Mattermost server\'s base URL here',
    });

    $bot->connect();

    package Local::MyBot;

    use Moo;

    extends 'Net::Mattermost::Bot';

    # A message was posted to the channel
    sub event_posted {
        my $self = shift;
        my $args = shift;

        # $args contains data from Mattermost

        return $self->_post_to_channel({
            channel_id => 1234,
            message    => 'This will be output to channel with ID "1234"',
        });
    }

    1;

API calls can also be made directly to Mattermost using their v4 API (using
Furl):

    sub event_posted {
        my $self = shift;

        # Get a list of your team's custom emoticons
        my $res = $self->furl->get($self->api_url.'/emoji', $self->headers);

        # ...
    }
