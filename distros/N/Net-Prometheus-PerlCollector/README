NAME

    Net::Prometheus::PerlCollector - obtain statistics about the perl
    interpreter

SYNOPSIS

       use Net::Prometheus;
       use Net::Prometheus::PerlCollector;
    
       my $client = Net::Prometheus->new;
       $client->register( Net::Prometheus::PerlCollector->new );

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a class that collects metrics about the perl
    interpreter itself.

 Metrics

    The following metrics are collected:

      * perl_heap_arenas

      A gauge giving the number of arenas the heap is split into.

      * perl_heap_svs

      A gauge giving the total number of SVs allocated on the heap.

    Note that the way these metrics are collected requires counting them
    all every time. While this code is relatively efficient, it is still a
    linear scan, and may itself cause some slowdown of the process at the
    time it is collected, if the heap has grown very large, containing a
    great number of SVs.
