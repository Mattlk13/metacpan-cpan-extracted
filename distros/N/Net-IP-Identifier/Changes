0.106     2015-05-25 14:23:10-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
    Significant improvements to extra/check_plugin:
        add modules for parsing and caching WHOIS results.
        each successful WHOIS fetch is cached into an SQLite database (file
            is ~/.whois_cache.sqlite by default).  subsequent fetches of
            the same netblock come from the cache instead of re-fetching.
            cached entries are considered 'stale' after 30 days (default).
        Net::IP::Identifier::WhoisCache is a 'modulino', so it can be used
            as a standalone script.
        much better handling of candidate netblocks.
        improved reporting of netblocks that fail parsing or that don't
            belong to the entity.
        output in a format more suitable for including in the Plugin
            module.
        output chunks are combined into a single netblock when possible.

    All plugins re-checked with improved check_plugin, leading to better,
        more accurate coverage.

    Add plugins for DigitalOcean, Koffi-vend, LeaseWeb, Centarra (Avante),
        and ChinaNet (163data.com.cn).

    Add a plugin for internal (non-routable) netblocks (such as 10.0.0.0
        and 192.168.0.0).  The entity is 'internal'.
