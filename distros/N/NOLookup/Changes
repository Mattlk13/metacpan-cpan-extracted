       Norid whois output (rdap2whois behaviour).
       Useful for testing, for users familiar with the whois output

     - NOLookup::Brreg::DataLookup, NOLookup::BrregDifi::DataLookup:
       $mech->text should not be called unless content is html, so
       clone version 1.16 change.
       This will make the module it more future safe in case '<' or
       other problematic html char should be allowed in a company name
       or other field. None problematic chars seen so far though.

1.16 2019-03-28

     - NOLookup::Patent::DataLookup: use
       $mech->content(format=>'text') instead of $mech->text, since
       decode_json() on the the latter fails and dies if a json key
       contains letter '<'.

1.15 2019-02-25

     - Support NOLookup::Brreg::DataLookup version accept_header
       request, ref.

       - Also search search on changed orgs (-d/-i).

       The version supported by v1.11 are removed because Brreg
       will remove it eventually, e.g:
       https://data.brreg.no/oppslag/enhetsregisteret/enheter.xhtml

1.11 2018-08-09

     - Handle case that holder info is missing when using the Norid
