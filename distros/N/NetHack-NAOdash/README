NetHack-NAOdash version 0.003
=============================

NetHack is a roguelike (a kind of video game) and NAO
(http://alt.org/nethack/) is a popular NetHack public server.

NetHack::NAOdash is a library that analyzes the games played by a user
on NAO and extracts some statistics from them. One use case is
answering the question "What should I play in NetHack now?". Besides
NAO, it works on any NetHack installation that supports extended
logfiles.

This distribution also includes a web interface to the library
(App::Web::NAOdash) and a command-line interface (App::NAOdash).
