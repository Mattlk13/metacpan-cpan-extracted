This is cool:


#pod     $parent = path("foo/bar/baz")->parent(2); # foo


sub parent {
    my ( $self, $level ) = @_;
    return $level == 1 ? $parent : $parent->parent( $level - 1 );
}



__PACKAGE__->create_children inflates the shit out of anything.. we could make
it do this on package need, but then we would need to be able to figure out
child regexes without loading the modules.. :(



we need to get rid of add_method.  We can use Package::Variant as an
alternative.
