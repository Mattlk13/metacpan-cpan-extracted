National numbering plans:
  http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/nnp/index.html

Coverage:
  stubs at 100% except:
    JE: mysterious!
    MF: because of overlapping number ranges with GP and BL
    VA: because it's part of Italy as far as libphonenumber is concerned
  NANP at 100% except:
    NANP.pm: appears to be some oddity around eval "use ..."

  Number::Phone needs branch/cond coverage improving
