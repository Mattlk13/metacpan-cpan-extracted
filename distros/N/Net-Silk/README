Net-Silk
========

Net::Silk is a perl binding to the SiLK library:

  SiLK, the System for Internet-Level Knowledge, is a collection of
  traffic analysis tools developed by the CERT Network Situational
  Awareness Team (CERT NetSA) to facilitate security analysis of large
  networks. The SiLK tool suite supports the efficient collection,
  storage, and analysis of network flow data, enabling network security
  analysts to rapidly query large historical traffic data sets. SiLK is
  ideally suited for analyzing traffic on the backbone or border of a
  large, distributed enterprise or mid-sized ISP.

SiLK is available for download here:

This release was tested on SiLK version 3.17.2.
