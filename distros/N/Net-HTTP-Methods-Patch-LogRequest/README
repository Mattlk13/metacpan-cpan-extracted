    Sample script and output:

     % LOG_SHOW_CATEGORY=1 TRACE=1 perl -MLog::ger::Output=Screen \

     [cat Net.HTTP.Methods.Patch.LogRequest][23] HTTP request (142 bytes):
     GET / HTTP/1.1
     TE: deflate,gzip;q=0.3
     Connection: TE, close
     Accept-Encoding: gzip
     Host: www.google.com
     User-Agent: WWW-Mechanize/1.71

     [cat Net.HTTP.Methods.Patch.LogRequest][70] HTTP request (144 bytes):
     GET / HTTP/1.1
     TE: deflate,gzip;q=0.3

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches Net::HTTP::Methods so that raw LWP HTTP request is
    logged using Log::ger. If you look into LWP::Protocol::http's source
    code, you'll see that it is already doing that (albeit commented):

      my $req_buf = $socket->format_request($method, $fullpath, @h);
      #print "------\n$req_buf\n------\n";

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP (or WWW::Mechanize, etc).

  How to log request content?
    See LWP::UserAgent::Patch::LogRequestContent.
