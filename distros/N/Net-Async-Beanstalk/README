A non-blocking beanstalk client based on IO::Async. It is loosely
based on Graham Barr's AnyEvent::Beanstalk.

This is the first release of this software and lacks any tests so
although the API is unlikely to change it is nevertheless marked as
version 0.1.

Version 0.2 brings in a marginally more sane UI and basic usage
documented and tested.
