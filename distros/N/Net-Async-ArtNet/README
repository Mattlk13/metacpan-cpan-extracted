NAME

    Net::Async::ArtNet - use ArtNet with IO::Async

SYNOPSIS

       use IO::Async::Loop;
       use Net::Async::ArtNet;
    
       my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
    
       $loop->add( Net::Async::ArtNet->new(
          on_dmx => sub {
             my $self = shift;
             my ( $seq, $phy, $universe, $data ) = @_;
    
             return unless $phy == 0 and $universe == 0;
    
             my $ch10 = $data->[10 - 1];  # DMX channels are 1-indexed
             print "Channel 10 now set to: $ch10\n";
          }
       ) );
    
       $loop->run;

DESCRIPTION

    This object class allows you to use the Art-Net protocol with
    IO::Async. It receives Art-Net frames containing DMX data.

EVENTS

 on_dmx $seq, $phy, $uni, $data

    A new set of DMX control values has been received. $seq contains the
    sequence number from the packet, $phy and $uni the physical and
    universe numbers, and $data will be an ARRAY reference containing up to
    512 DMX control values.

PARAMETERS

    The following named parameters may be passed to new or configure.
    Additionally, CODE references to set callbacks for events may be
    passed.

    port => INT

      Optional. Port number to listen for Art-Net packets on.
