0.03 Wed May 3 2017
- BREAKING: Endpoint’s “out” parameter must now be an instance of
  IO::Framed::Write (or implement the same behavior).

- BREAKING: Parse’s parameter must now implement IO::Framed::Read.

- BREAKING: Because we now farm the I/O out to IO::Framed
  (or whatever replacement class you may prefer), some of the thrown
  exceptions are changed:

    Net::WebSocket::X::ReadFilehandle is gone. If you use IO::Framed,
    you’ll now receive IO::Framed::X::ReadError

    Net::WebSocket::X::EmptyRead is gone. If you use IO::Framed,
    you’ll now receive IO::Framed::X::EmptyRead.

- BREAKING: I’ve removed the before_send_control_frame() handler.

- Net::WebSocket::Parser now instantiates the “target” frame class object,
  not the base Net::WebSocket::Frame class. So there’s no more of the
  AUTOLOAD shenanigans of before.

- Removed the Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny dependency. It doesn’t seem we
  really need cryptographically strong random numbers for masking or
  handshakes.

- Frame I/O logic is now distributed separately as IO::Framed. It’s not
  a strict dependency of this library, but you’re probably going to want
  it nonetheless, unless you want to reimplement that logic yourself.

- EINTR-trapping logic is now distributed separatedly as IO::SigGuard.
  (… which is used in IO::Framed)

- Added documentation for Net::WebSocket::Streamer

- Refactor ping handling behavior into its own module. It could be
  reusable potentially?

- Demos now favor IO::Events.

- Shell server demo now included. Hook it up to a nice JavaScript terminal
  emulator like xterm.js, and impress all your friends. :)
