    - Thanks to Eric Smid for reporting, tracking down the cause of, 
      proposing a fix for and testing the pesky newline issue in RT 122919.
    - Fix RT 122919: _normalize() always running.  Moves to waitfor()
    - _normalize() changed to address Net::Telnet::Cisco RT 118170.
      Also changed in Net::Telnet::Cisco 1.11.
    - Change -binmode to emulate Net::Telnet:
      Replace \015\012 with \012 in waitfor() via _interpret_cr().
      NOTE:  Dump and input logs were already and still are the same 
      between us and Net::Telnet::Cisco.
    - Added _interpret_cr() from Net::Telnet to address above.
    - Fix undiscovered bug in enable() removing $error.
    - Change put() to print() in enable() to better align with 
      Net::Telnet::Cisco.
    - Check for '' instead of not defined for $en_level to catch enable() 
      success or failure (also changed in Net::Telnet::Cisco 1.11).
    - Added more_prompt named arg to new() (bug, was missing).

    - Fix ignore_warnings parameter and added warnings() sub.  Seems this 
      was missing in Net::Telnet::Cisco so wasn't ported.  Thanks to 
      Joe Knecht for both discovering the issue and testing the fix.
    - Fix Timeout option deprecated in Net::SSH2 connect() method after 
      version 0.58.
    - Fix version compare for Socket module (for IPv6) with 'use version'.
    - Fix some POD spelling.
