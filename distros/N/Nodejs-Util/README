append:FUNCTIONS

 system_nodejs([ \%opts ], @argv)

    Will call IPC::System::Options's system(), but with node.js binary as
    the first argument. Known options:

      * harmony_scoping => bool

      If set to 1, will attempt to enable block scoping. This means at
      least node.js v0.5.10 (where --harmony_scoping is first recognized).
      But --harmony_scoping is no longer needed after v2.0.0 and no longer
      recognized in later versions.

      * path => str

      Will be passed to nodejs_available().

    Other options will be passed to IPC::System::Options's system().
