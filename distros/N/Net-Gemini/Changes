        Somehow Encode.pm had gone AWOL, and other bugfixes. Parse for

        Sneakily rely on URI.pm for URL handling. Add a bin/gmitool
        utility script, gets gemini resources. Various breaking
        interface changes. Better ensure that the socket gets closed
        when not needed.

        Various network tests as expected are not portable, require
