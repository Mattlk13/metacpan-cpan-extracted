Net-IPAM-Tree

Net::IPAM::Tree - A CIDR/Block tree library for fast IP lookup with longest-prefix-match.

A module for fast IP-routing-table lookups and IP-ACLs (Access Control Lists).

It is NOT a standard patricia-trie implementation.
This isn't possible for general blocks not represented by bitmasks.
Every tree item is a Net::IPAM::Block or a subclass of it.
