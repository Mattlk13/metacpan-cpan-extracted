DESCRIPTION

FAQ

 How do I find closest numbers that are {smaller, larger} than specified
 number?

    You can filter (grep) your list of numbers first, for example to find
    numbers that are closest and smaller or equal to 3:

     my @nums = grep {$_ <= 3} 1, 3, 5, 2, 4;
     my $res = find_closest_number(number => 3, numbers => \@nums);

 How do I find unique closest number(s)?

    Perform uniq() (see List::MoreUtils) on the resulting numbers.
