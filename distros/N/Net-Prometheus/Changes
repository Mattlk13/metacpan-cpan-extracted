         * Module style updates:
            + use v5.14

0.12    2022-01-07
        [CHANGES]
         * Added ->export_to_Future_IO

        [CHANGES]
         * Include the Net::Prometheus::PerlCollector module
         * Optionally skip building the XS part of PerlCollector if a C

0.09    2020-05-01
        [CHANGES]
         * Pass additional options from query params or ->render method into
           collector ->collect methods

        [CHANGES]
         * Added Net::Prometheus::Registry

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Prometheus needs all the labelsets of every variable grouped
           together; so rearrange the ->collect results

        [CHANGES]
         * Implement a process collector for Linux
