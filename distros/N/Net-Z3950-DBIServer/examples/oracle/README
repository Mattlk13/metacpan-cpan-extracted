This directory is not strictly an example zSQLgate configuration, but
an example of how to get zSQLgate to talk to Oracle.  It contains
various notes on various aspects of Oracle lore, including some
specific to particular installations.


Connecting Oracle's own command-line client
-------------------------------------------

It seems that the ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID environment variables
must be set in order for the basic command-line SQL client to work.
For example, on Index Data's installation:

	mike@test:~$ :mike@test:~$ ORACLE_SID=test ORACLE_HOME=/home/oracle/app/oracle/product/9.2.0 strace -o /tmp/xx /home/oracle/app/oracle/product/9.2.0/bin/sqlplus
	SQL*Plus: Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production on Wed Oct 3 12:53:08 2007

	Copyright (c) 1982, 2002, Oracle Corporation.  All rights reserved.

	Enter user-name: mike
	Enter password: ********

	Connected to:
	Oracle9i Enterprise Edition Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production
	With the Partitioning, OLAP and Oracle Data Mining options
	JServer Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production

	SQL> 

Other important environment variable settings are described at:

Building and testing DBD::Oracle on test.indexdata.com
------------------------------------------------------

$ cd /home/mike/download/DBD-Oracle-1.19/
$ ORACLE_HOME=/home/oracle/app/oracle/product/9.2.0 perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/mike/universe OPTIMIZE="-O0 -g"
$ make
$ ORACLE_HOME=/home/oracle/app/oracle/product/9.2.0 ORACLE_SID=test ORACLE_USERID=mike/mike3636 make test

This does not pass all tests, but passes enough that we can see it's
basically working.  Failures are to do with LOB support (Large
OBject?), and skips to do with funny character sets.
