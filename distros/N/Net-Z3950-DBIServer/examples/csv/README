Years ago, I used to keep a spreadsheet of every book I read (yes,
yes, I know that's pathetic.)  Shortly before I gave it up in favour
of a life, I exported that spreadsheet from "sc" into CSV format --
that's the utterly trivial Comma Separated Values format.

The file called "books" in this directory is that exported CSV file,
totally un-retouched.  I created a small but perfectly formed zSQLgate
configuration file, "csv.nzd", to go with it; and the result is that
you can now search that database via Z39.50.  From the root directory
of the zSQLgate distribution (../..), start the server like this:

	$ zSQLgate examples/csv/csv.nzd
	[...]

And away you go with your favourite client:

	$ yaz-client tcp:@:9999
	Z> base books
	Z> find @attr 1=4 @attr 5=1 The
	Number of hits: 156
	Z> format xml
	Z> show 1+10
	<book>
