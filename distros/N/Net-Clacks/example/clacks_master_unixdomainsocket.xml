    <!-- This is the magic that makes Unix domain sockets possible
         In most (is not all) cases, you should use absolute paths.
         The only reason this one isn't: I don't know anything about
         *your* system, so i used only the filename.

         If you are so inclined, you can specify multiple <socket> lines
         to listen on multiple unix domain sockets...
         ...for whatever reason you might have -->
