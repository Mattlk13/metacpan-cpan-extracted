- forward keep-alive \r\n in TCP in stateless proxy. See RFC 5626 4.4.1
- support TLS
- Redirect only specific domains, ignore rest so that it can be
  chained with proxy for the rest
- document dns_host2ip and dns_domain2srv in Net::SIP::Dispatcher
- do not look up tcp in Dispatcher::resolve_uri  if we have no leg
  which can do tcp
- more tests
- more documentation
  * samples for integration with other loops
