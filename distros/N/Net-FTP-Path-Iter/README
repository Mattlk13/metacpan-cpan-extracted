Net::FTP::Path::Iter

Net::FTP::Path::Iter is a subclass of Path::Iterator::Rule which
iterates over an FTP site rather than a local filesystem.

See the documentation Path::Iterator::Rule for how to filter and
traverse paths. When Net::FTP::Path::Iter passes a path to a callback or
returns one from an iterator, it will be in the form of a
Net::FTP::Path::Iter::Entry object.

Net::FTP::Path::Iter uses Net::FTP to connect to the FTP site.

  Symbolic Links

At present, Net::FTP::Path::Iter does not handle symbolic links. It will
output an error and skip them.
