1.000     2017-12-09 16:51:40+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    First stable release. Note that there are some API changes, but
    previous code should work mostly unmodified.

    New features:

    - Dropped Protocol::Redis in favour of local implementation
    - Separated out commands into an autogenerated class to make
    it easier to keep up to date with protocol changes
    - Better support for subscriptions (see `examples/pub|sub.pl`)
    - Dropped JSON::MaybeXS and Mixin::Event::Dispatch deps, events
    are now handled through Ryu

    Known issues:

    - All data is assumed to be binary, callers need their own
    Encode::encode()/::decode() calls - future versions are likely
    to include an `->encoding` setting and/or `_utf8` versions of
    string methods.
