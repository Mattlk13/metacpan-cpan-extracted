    forwarding databases

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::SNMP;
      use Net::SNMP::Mixin;

      my $session = Net::SNMP->session( -hostname => 'foo.bar.com' );
      $session->mixer('Net::SNMP::Mixin::NXOSDot1qFdb');
      $session->init_mixins();
      snmp_dispatcher()   if $session->nonblocking;
      $session->init_ok();
      die $session->errors if $session->errors;

      foreach my $fdb_entry ( $session->get_dot1q_fdb_entries() ) {
        my $mac     = $fdb_entry->{MacAddress};
        my $vlan_id = $fdb_entry->{vlanId};
        my $port    = $fdb_entry->{dot1dBasePort};
        my $status  = $fdb_entry->{fdbStatus};

        print "$mac, $vlan_id, $port, $status\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    A Net::SNMP mixin class for forwarding database info of NXOS 802.1-Q
    limited MIBs.

MIXIN METHODS
  @fdb = OBJ->get_dot1q_fdb_entries()
    Returns a list of fdb entries. Every list element is a reference to a
    hash with the following fields and values:

        {
          MacAddress      => 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX',
          dot1dBasePort   => Integer,
          vlanId          => Integer,
          fdbStatus       => Integer,
          fdbStatusString => String,
        }

    MacAddress
        MacAddress received, in normalized IEEE form XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.

    dot1dBasePort
        The receiving bride-port for the MAC address.

    vlanId
        Every MacAdress is related to a distinct vlanId.

    fdbStatus
        The status of this entry. The meanings of the values are:

            1 = other
            2 = invalid
            3 = learned
            4 = self
            5 = mgmt

        For more information please see the corresponding Q-BRIDGE-MIB.

    fdbStatusString
        The status of this entry in string form, see above.

INITIALIZATION
  OBJ->_init($reload)
    Fetch the fdb related snmp values from the host. Don't call this method
    direct!

PRIVATE METHODS
    Only for developers or maintainers.

  _fetch_dot1q_tp_fdb_table()
    Fetch the forwarding databases from the dot1qTpFdbTable once during
    object initialization.

SEE ALSO
    Net::SNMP::Mixin::Dot1dBase for a mapping between ifIndexes and
    dot1dBasePorts.

REQUIREMENTS
    Net::SNMP, Net::SNMP::Mixin
