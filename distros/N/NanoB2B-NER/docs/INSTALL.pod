=head1 INSTALLATION 

If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local 
install, you can install via: 

 perl -MCPAN -e shell
 > install NanoB2B-NER 


If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,  
unpacking, and executing the following commands. 

                perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                make
                make test
                make install

Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you create 
a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access. 

You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment 
variable to access this module when running.

If you have the super-user access, then you can install NanoB2B-NER 
into system directories via :
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install
	 	make clean

The exact location of where NanoB2B-NER will be installed 
depends on your system configuration. A message will be printed 
out after 'make install' telling your exactly where it was installed.
