NAME
    Number::Util::Range - Find sequences in number arrays & convert to range
    (e.g. 100,2,3,4,5,101 -> 100,"2..5",101)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Number::Util::Range (from Perl
    distribution Number-Util-Range), released on 2023-01-04.

FUNCTIONS
  convert_number_sequence_to_range
    Usage:

     convert_number_sequence_to_range(%args) -> any

    Find sequences in number arrays & convert to range (e.g. 100,2,3,4,5,101
    -> 100,"2..5",101).

    Examples:

    *   basic, non-numbers ignored:

         convert_number_sequence_to_range(array => [100, 2 .. 5, 101, "foo"]); # -> [100, "2..5", 101, "foo"]

    *   option: separator:

         convert_number_sequence_to_range(array => [100, 2 .. 5, 101], separator => "-"); # -> [100, "2-5", 101]

    *   multiple ranges, negative number:

         convert_number_sequence_to_range(array => [100, 2 .. 6, 101, 102, -5 .. -2, 103]);

        Result:

         [100, "2..6", 101, 102, "-5..-2", 103]

    *   option: threshold:

         convert_number_sequence_to_range(array => [100, 2 .. 5, 101], threshold => 5); # -> [100, 2 .. 5, 101]

    *   option: ignore_duplicates:

         convert_number_sequence_to_range(array => [1 .. 4, 2, 9, 9, 9], ignore_duplicates => 1); # -> ["1..4", 9]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   array => *array[str]*

        (No description)

    *   ignore_duplicates => *true*

        (No description)

    *   separator => *str* (default: "..")

        (No description)

    *   threshold => *posint* (default: 4)

        (No description)

    Return value: (any)

SEE ALSO
    Data::Dump also does something similar when dumping arrays of numbers,
    e.g. if you say "dd [1,2,3,4];" it will dump the array as "[1..4]".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
