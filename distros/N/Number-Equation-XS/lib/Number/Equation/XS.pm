=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Number::Equation;
	my $foo = Number::Equation->new(42);
	my $n = Number::Equation->new(42);
	$n = $n - 2;
	$n /= 10;
	$n *= 3;
	$n += 1;
	my $m = 1 / $n;
	print $m->equation; # (1 / ((((42 - 2) / 10) * 3) + 1)) = 0.0769230769230769

	my $n = Number::Equation->new(42, .01);
	$n = $n - 2;
	$n /= 10;
	$n *= 3;
	$n += 1;
	my $m = 1 / $n;
	print $m->equation; # (1 / ((((42 - 2) / 10) * 3) + 1)) â‰ˆ 0.08

	my $n = Number::Equation->new(211, 0);
	$n = $n ** 2;
	print $n->equation; # (211 ** 2) = 44521
	$n = $n % 2;
	print $n->equation; # ((211 ** 2) % 7) = 1
