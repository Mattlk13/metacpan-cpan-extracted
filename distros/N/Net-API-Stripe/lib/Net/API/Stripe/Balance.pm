=head1 NAME

Net::API::Stripe::Balance - The Balance object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $object = $stripe->balances( 'retrieve' ) || die( $stripe->error );

=head1 VERSION

    v0.101.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account.

You can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of transactions (L<https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/balance-transaction-types>) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth).

The available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new( %ARG )

Creates a new L<Net::API::Stripe::Balance> object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 object string, value is "balance"

String representing the objectâ€™s type. Objects of the same type share the same value.

=head2 available array of L<Net::API::Stripe::Connect::Transfer>

Funds that are available to be transferred or paid out, whether automatically by Stripe or explicitly via the Transfers API or Payouts API. The available balance for each currency and payment type can be found in the source_types property.

Currently this is an array of L<Net::API::Stripe::Connect::Transfer>, but I am considering revising that in light of the documentation of the Stripe API.

Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.
