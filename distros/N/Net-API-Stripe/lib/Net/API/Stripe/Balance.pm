=head1 NAME

Net::API::Stripe::Balance - The Balance object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $object = $stripe->balances( 'retrieve' ) || die( $stripe->error );

=head1 VERSION

    0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account.

You can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of transactions (L<https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/balance-transaction-types>) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth).

The available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item B<new>( %ARG )

Creates a new L<Net::API::Stripe::Balance> object.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<object> string, value is "balance"

String representing the objectâ€™s type. Objects of the same type share the same value.

=item B<available> array of C<Net::API::Stripe::Connect::Transfer>

Funds that are available to be transferred or paid out, whether automatically by Stripe or explicitly via the Transfers API or Payouts API. The available balance for each currency and payment type can be found in the source_types property.

Currently this is an array of C<Net::API::Stripe::Connect::Transfer>, but I am considering revising that in light of the documentation of the Stripe API.

=over 8

=item B<amount> integer

Balance amount.

=item B<currency> currency

Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.

=item B<source_types> hash

Breakdown of balance by source types.

=item I<bank_account> integer

Amount for bank account.

=item I<card> integer

=back

=back

=item B<connect_reserved> array of C<Net::API::Stripe::Balance::ConnectReserved> objects.

=over 8

=item B<amount> integer

Balance amount.

=item B<currency> currency

Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.

=item B<source_types> hash

Breakdown of balance by source types.

=item B<pending> array of C<Net::API::Stripe::Balance::Pending> objects.

Funds that are not yet available in the balance, due to the 7-day rolling pay cycle. The pending balance for each currency, and for each payment type, can be found in the source_types property.
