NAME
    Number::Format::Metric - Format number with metric prefix

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.602 of Number::Format::Metric (from
    Perl distribution Number-Format-Metric), released on 2023-02-14.

SYNOPSIS
     use Number::Format::Metric qw(format_metric);

     format_metric(14     , {base=>10});               # => "14.0"
     format_metric(14     , {base=>10, precision=>0}); # => "14"
     format_metric(12001  , {base=> 2, precision=>1}); # => "11.7k"
     format_metric(12001  , {base=>10, precision=>3}); # => "12.001ki"
     format_metric(-0.0017, {base=>10});               # => "-1.7m"
     format_metric(1.26e6 , {base=>10});               # => "1.3Mi"

FUNCTIONS
    None exported by default but all of them exportable.

  format_metric($num, \%opts) => STR
    Format $num using metric prefix. Locale settings are respected (this
    module uses locale). Might produce non-Latin Unicode characters (e.g. Î¼
    for 1e-6 prefix). Known options:

    *   base => INT (either 2 or 10, default: 2)

    *   precision => INT

    *   i_mark => BOOL (default: 1)

        Give "i" suffix to prefixes when in base 10 for k, M, G, T, and so
        on.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
