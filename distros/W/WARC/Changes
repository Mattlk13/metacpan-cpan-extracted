Revision history for Perl module distribution WARC.

0.0.1		2020-04-16
	- first "open beta" release

0.0.0_12	2020-04-04
	- initial steps towards support for writing WARC volumes
	  - WARC::Record can now hold a data block
	  - WARC::Record::Sponge allows collecting data for a WARC record
            into a temporary file; permitting records too large for memory

	- WARC::Record now has a convenience getter for the record length

	- the "open_payload" method on WARC records now has an initial
          implementation with the caveat that transfer and content decoding
          are not yet implemented

	- inconsistencies fixed:
	  - the "segments" method now returns 1 when called on a
            non-segmented record in scalar context
	  - attempting to load a record at an undefined offset in a volume
            now raises an error instead of treating the undefined value as
            zero and returning the first record in the volume
	  - tied handles for reading record blocks now correctly handle the
            "readline" operation in list context, even though in practice
            this could easily cause the program to run out of memory

0.0.0_11	2020-02-22
	- Index support improvements:
	  - add support for building CDX indexes
	  - implement common WARC::Index->build class method

0.0.0_10	2020-02-12
	- quick release to improve signal-to-noise ratio on test reports

	- add missing dependencies on HTTP::Message, HTTP::Request,
          HTTP::Response modules used to replay HTTP exchanges

	- no actual code changes

0.0.0_9		2020-02-11
	- fix bug in WARC::Record::Logical::Heuristics tests that caused
          spurious failures in some automated test environments

	- add infrastructure for replay of WARC records
	  - WARC::Record::Replay registry and autoloader
	  - WARC::Record::FromVolume::replay object method
	  - implement replay of HTTP messages

	- add in-memory index support as WARC::Index::Volatile

	- coalescing a single index entry now simply returns that entry

	- add union index queries
	  - implement nested loop join in WARC::Collection
	  - support multiple values in distance method of WARC::Index::Entry

0.0.0_8		2019-10-22
	- quick release after previous release had a very high failure rate

	- fix bug in WARC::Record::Logical::Block tests that caused
          failures on nearly all perls except for my own environment

	- use the "if" pragma to select Carp's verbose mode when the test
          scripts are running with the environment variable
          AUTOMATED_TESTING set to a true value

0.0.0_7		2019-10-22
	- implement reassembly of segmented WARC records
	  - WARC::Record::Logical
	  - WARC::Record::Logical::Block
	  - WARC::Record::Logical::Heuristics

	- records now carry the WARC::Collection that provided them
	  - allow storing additional parameters in record stubs
	  - WARC::Collection can now report if any index can search on a key

	- WARC::Record POD now includes a quick reference for which WARC
          headers are required for the various WARC record types

	- fix incomplete cloning of WARC::Fields objects

	- improve performance of "next" method on compressed records when
          the "sl" GZIP extended header is used

0.0.0_6		2019-09-14
	- implement WARC::Collection

	- declare minimum version for dependency on Test::More

	- Index support improvements:
	  - indexes can now report ability to search on particular keys
	  - index entries can now be retrieved by position and can report
            their positions to provide for future metaindex support
	  - indexes can now search for WARC-Record-ID values
	  - CDX index files can now be read

0.0.0_5		2019-09-10
	- quick release after previous release had a very high failure rate

	- fix bug in WARC::Record::FromVolume tests that caused failures on
          perl 5.18+ due to improved hash randomization

	- kill a bogus inherited constructor in WARC::Record::FromVolume

	- implement WARC::Index::Entry
	- add WARC::Record::Stub for load-on-demand record objects

	- replace platform-based test with direct feature test in
          WARC::Volume to determine if inode numbers from stat are valid
	  - The new test assumes that stat either returns a constant bogus
            inode number, or that the dev:ino fields are as POSIX requires.

	- declare dependencies on core modules to ensure that the installed
          version is included in test reports

0.0.0_4		2019-09-08
	- quick release after previous release had 100% FAIL on CPAN Testers

	- fix bug in WARC::Record tests that was causing random failures
	- fix missing "use overload fallback => 1" in WARC::Volume
	  - bizarrely, the tests passed here without it

	- implement WARC::Index index system registration

0.0.0_3		2019-09-07
	- skip POD verification test if Pod::Checker is too old

	- implement WARC::Date
	- implement WARC::Volume
	- implement basic support for reading WARC files
	  - WARC::Record::Block
	  - part of WARC::Record
	  - part of WARC::Record::FromVolume

	- WARC::Fields
	  - test performance improved
	  - ->as_block now uses strict UTF-8
	  - parsing tests now skipped if Perl core lacks in-memory files

	- document 'sl' gzip extension header generated by GNU Wget
	  - WARC::Builder will also support writing this header
	  - WARC::Record uses this header if available

0.0.0_2		2019-08-31
	- skip POD verification test if Pod::Checker is not available

	- improve unit tests
	  - tests now "use strict" and "use warnings"
	  - tests now abort if loading target module fails

	- declare dependency on Scalar::Util for WARC::Fields
