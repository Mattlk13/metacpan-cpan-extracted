NAME
    WordList::FR::ODS3 - ODS3 wordlist

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of WordList::FR::ODS3 (from Perl
    distribution WordList-FR-ODS3), released on 2020-05-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use WordList::FR::ODS3;

     my $wl = WordList::FR::ODS3->new;

     # Pick a (or several) random word(s) from the list
     my $word = $wl->pick;
     my @words = $wl->pick(3);

     # Check if a word exists in the list
     if ($wl->word_exists('foo')) { ... }

     # Call a callback for each word
     $wl->each_word(sub { my $word = shift; ... });

     # Iterate
     my $first_word = $wl->first_word;
     while (defined(my $word = $wl->next_word)) { ... }

     # Get all the words
     my @all_words = $wl->all_words;

DESCRIPTION
    From <http://www.gtoal.com/scrabble/details/french/>: "The official
    French scrabble wordlist is ODS. There have been three major releases of
    this; ODS2 (aka ODS '94), ODS3 (aka ODS '99) and ODS 2000. ODS 2 and
    ODS3 are available on the net if you know where to look."

    The list of words is from <http://chr.amet.perso.infonie.fr/ods3.htm>.

    Some notes about this wordlist: unaccented, uses random-seek algorithm
    for pick() (which gives higher probability for longer words).
