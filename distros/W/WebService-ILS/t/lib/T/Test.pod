=head1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT

Testing C<WebService::ILS> modules is extremely difficult. It requires
test accounts with vendors, sometimes special setup for handling
redirect URLs.

In that respect for building purposes, all tests are skipped by default.
If you want to run tests for vendor specific modules during the build,
you need to set the corresponding WEBSERVICE_ILS_TEST_* env vars to true,
and supply values in vendor specific env vars. Those vendor specific vars
correspond to L<CONSTRUCTOR> params.

When set to true turns on tests from t/overdrve_library.t, which test
C<WebService::ILS::OverDrive::Library> module

=item B<WEBSERVICE_ILS_TEST_OVERDRIVE_PATRON>

When set to true turns on tests from t/overdrve_patron.t, which test
C<WebService::ILS::OverDrive::Patron> module

=item B<WEBSERVICE_ILS_TEST_OVERDRIVE_AUTH>

When set to true turns on tests from t/overdrve_auth.t, which test
OverDrive Granted (3-legged) authentication mechanism. It is separated
because of the challenges it presents

                                             the internet it will be the
                                             designated port above and your
                                             redirect url will look like

                                             Otherwise you'll need some port
                                             forwarding like
                                             ssh -R designated_port:localhost:listen_port host.facing.internet
