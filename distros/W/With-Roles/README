NAME
    With::Roles - Create role/class/object with composed roles

SYNOPSIS
      use With::Roles;
      # create class inheriting from My::Class, with My::Role applied
      my $class = My::Class->with::roles('My::Role');

      # create a role with My::Role, then Another::Role applied
      my $role = My::Role->with::roles('Another::Role');

      # generated role can be applied
      my $obj = My::Class->with::roles($role)->new;

      # apply role to object
      $obj->with::roles('Yet::Another::Role');

      # applies the role My::Class::Role::My::Role
      my $another_class = My::Class->with::roles('+My::Role');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an easy to use global function that can be used on
    any package to create a new package with a set of roles applied.

    When used on classes, generates a subclass with the given roles applied.

    When used on roles, generates a new role with the base and given roles
    applied.

    When used on objects, applies the roles to the object and returns the
    object. Unlike with roles and classes, this modifies the invocant.

    Compatible with Moose, Moo, Mouse, and Role::Tiny roles and classes.

    The generated packages will have names based on the original classes and
    roles to aid with debugging. The exact form of the generated names
    should not be relied on.

    A shorthand of "+RoleName" can be used for roles named like
    "MyClass::Role::RoleName". Additional roles applied will continue to
    base the name on the original class. The package can also provide a
    method "ROLE_BASE" to return a prefix to use other than "MyClass::Role".
    "ROLE_BASE" support is experimental, and may be removed or changed in a
    future version.
