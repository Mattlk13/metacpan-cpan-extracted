    lookup_symbol

      Binance works with symbols which represent the exchange rate between
      a pair of currencies. e.g. BTCETH represents exchnage rate from
      Bitcoin (BTC) -> Etherium (ETH). This method does a best-guess at
      what the two currencies are from a given symbol. Usage:

          my( $from, $to ) = $binance->lookup_symbol( 'BTCETH' );
