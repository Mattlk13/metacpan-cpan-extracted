NAME
    WordList::Password::10Million::Top1000000 - Top 1,000,000 passwords from
    10_million_password_list

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    WordList::Password::10Million::Top1000000 (from Perl distribution
    WordList-Password-10Million-Top1000000), released on 2020-05-24.

DESCRIPTION
    Source: <https://weakpass.com/wordlist/50> (retrieved 2018-02-20).

    Wordlist is sorted by popularity (most popular first).

    Duplicate entries in the original list have been removed: pedr (2).

    Uses random-seek pick() which gives higher probability for longer words.

    Uses bloom filter so word_exists() can give a small chance of false
    positive (bloom filter size=2.1M, k=13, false-positive rate=0.03259%).
