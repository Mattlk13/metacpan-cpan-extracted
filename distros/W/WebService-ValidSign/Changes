    * Failure is mandatory: CPAN-testers still report issues with
      JSON::XS 4.01 on various perl versions. Bump the requirement to
      4.02 in all cases when 4.01 is found.

    * CPAN-testers report issues with JSON::XS 4.01 which is buggy on
      perl 5.026 and up. This has been fixed by JSON::XS 4.02. Test with
      Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DynamicPrereqs to set the requirement to
      JSON::XS 4.02, otherwise we bump the required JSON::XS module to
      4.02
    * CPAN-testers report issues with Moo < 1.006000, bump the
      requirement for Moo to 1.006000
    * Testing with Zaaksysteem showed an issue with create_with_document
      where the package ID wasn't set after a create
    * Enhance the builders of objects to accept camelCase and snake_case for
      arguments so you can make an object directly from the JSON
    * Enhance the TO_JSON to automaticly convert snake_case to camelCase
      so objects are serialized to JSON correctly without having to
      override the TO_JSON every time.
