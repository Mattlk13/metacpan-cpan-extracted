NAME
    WebSocket - WebSocket Client & Server

SYNOPSIS
        use WebSocket qw( :ws ); # exports standard codes as constant

VERSION
        v0.1.6

DESCRIPTION
    This is the client (WebSocket::Client) and server (WebSocket::Server)
    implementation of WebSocket api. It provides a comprehensive well
    documented and hopefully easy-to-use implementation.

    Also, this api, by design, does not die, but rather returns "undef" and
    set an WebSocket::Exception that can be retrieved with the inherited
    "error" in Module::Generic method.

    It is important to always check the return value of a method. If it
    returns "undef" and unless this means something else, by default it
    means an error has occurred and you can retrieve it with the error
    method. If you fail to check return values, you are in for some trouble.
    If you would rather have error be fatal, you can instantiate objects
    with the option *fatal* set to a true value.

    Most of methods here allows chaining.

    You can also find a JavaScript WebSocket client library in this
    distribution under the "example" folder. The JavaScript library also has
    a pod documentation.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Create a new WebSocket object acting as an accessor.

    One object should be created per po file, because it stores internally
    the po data for that file in the Text::PO object instantiated.

    Returns the object.

METHODS
  client
    Convenient shortcut to instantiate a new WebSocket::Client object,
    passing it whatever argument was provided.

  compression_threshold
    Set or get the threshold in bytes above which the ut8 or binary messages
    will be compressed if the client and the server support compression and
    it is activated as an extension.

    See "extensions" in WebSocket::Client and "extensions" in
    WebSocket::Server.

  server
    Convenient shortcut to instantiate a new WebSocket::Server object,
    passing it whatever argument was provided.

CONSTANTS
    The following constants are available, but not exported by default. You
    can import them into your namespace using either the tag ":ws" or
    ":all", such as:

        use WebSocket qw( :ws );

  WS_OK
    Code 1000.

    The default, normal closure (used if no code supplied),

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1000 indicates a normal closure, meaning that the purpose for
    which the connection was established has been fulfilled."

  WS_GONE
    Code 1001

    The party is going away, e.g. server is shutting down, or a browser
    leaves the page.

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1001 indicates that an endpoint is "going away", such as a
    server going down or a browser having navigated away from a page."

  WS_PROTOCOL_ERROR
    Code 1002

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1002 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
    due to a protocol error."

  WS_NOT_ACCEPTABLE
    Code 1003

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1003 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
    because it has received a type of data it cannot accept (e.g., an
    endpoint that understands only text data MAY send this if it receives a
    binary message)."

  WS_NO_STATUS
    Code 1005

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1005 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code
    in a Close control frame by an endpoint. It is designated for use in
    applications expecting a status code to indicate that no status code was
    actually present."

  WS_CLOSED_ABNORMALLY
    Code 1006

    No way to set such code manually, indicates that the connection was lost
    (no close frame).

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1006 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code
    in a Close control frame by an endpoint. It is designated for use in
    applications expecting a status code to indicate that the connection was
    closed abnormally, e.g., without sending or receiving a Close control
    frame."

  WS_BAD_MESSAGE
    Code 1007

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1007 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
    because it has received data within a message that was not consistent
    with the type of the message (e.g., non-UTF-8 [RFC3629
    <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629>] data within a text
    message)."

  WS_FORBIDDEN
    Code 1008

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1008 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
    because it has received a message that violates its policy. This is a
    generic status code that can be returned when there is no other more
    suitable status code (e.g., 1003 or 1009) or if there is a need to hide
    specific details about the policy."

  WS_MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE
    Code 1009

    The message is too big to process.

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1009 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
    because it has received a message that is too big for it to process."

  WS_EXTENSIONS_NOT_AVAILABLE
    Code 1010

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1010 indicates that an endpoint (client) is terminating the
    connection because it has expected the server to negotiate one or more
    extension, but the server didn't return them in the response message of
    the WebSocket handshake. The list of extensions that are needed SHOULD
    appear in the /reason/ part of the Close frame. Note that this status
    code is not used by the server, because it can fail the WebSocket
    handshake instead."

  WS_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
    Code 1011

    Unexpected error on server.

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1011 indicates that a server is terminating the connection
    because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
    fulfilling the request."

  WS_TLS_HANDSHAKE_FAIL
    Code 1015

    rfc6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> describes
    this as: "1015 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code
    in a Close control frame by an endpoint. It is designated for use in
    applications expecting a status code to indicate that the connection was
    closed due to a failure to perform a TLS handshake (e.g., the server
    certificate can't be verified)."
