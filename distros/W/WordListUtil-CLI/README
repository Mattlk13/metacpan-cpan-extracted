NAME
    WordListUtil::CLI - Some utility routines related to WordList::* and the
    CLI

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of WordListUtil::CLI (from Perl
    distribution WordListUtil-CLI), released on 2020-05-22.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  instantiate_wordlist
    Usage:

     my $wl = instantiate_wordlist($name [ , $ignore ]);

    Examples:

     $wl1 = instantiate_wordlist("EN::Enable"); # dies on failure
     $wl2 = instantiate_wordlist("EN::Enable", 1); # return undef on failure
     $wl3 = instantiate_wordlist("MetaSyntactic::Any=theme,dangdut");

    Load WordList::* module and instantiate the class. In the above example,
    $wl1 will be an instance of WordList::EN::Enable class.

    Like Perl's "-M" option, you can also pass parameters to a parameterized
    wordlist using the "=val1,val2,..." syntax (see $wl3 example above).
