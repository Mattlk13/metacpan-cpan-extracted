=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents an error returned by MaxMind's minFraud web service. It
extends L<Throwable::Error> and adds attributes of its own.

=head1 METHODS

The C<< message >> and C<< stack_trace >> methods are
inherited from L<Throwable::Error>. The message will be the value provided by
the MaxMind web service. See L<https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud> for
details.

It also provides three methods of its own:

=head2 code

Returns the code returned by the MaxMind minFraud web service.

=head2 http_status

Returns the HTTP status. This should be either a 4xx or 5xx error.

=head2 uri

Returns the URI which gave the HTTP error.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs may be submitted through L<https://github.com/maxmind/minfraud-api-perl/issues>.
