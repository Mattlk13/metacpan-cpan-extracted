=head1 NAME

WebService::AbuseIPDB - Client for the API (version 2) of AbuseIPDB

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebService::AbuseIPDB;

    my $ipdb = WebService::AbuseIPDB->new (key => 'abc123...');
    my $res = $ipdb->check (ip => '127.0.0.2');
    die unless defined $res;
    printf "There is a %i%% chance this address is up to no good.\n",
        $res->score;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<https://www.abuseipdb.com/|AbuseIPDB> maintains a database of reports
of bad actors on the net. Users may interface with the database through
a web browser using forms on their site. An alternative is to use their
API. Version 1 of this API is to be retired in 2020. This module serves
as a client for Version 2 of the API.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

	my $ipdb = WebService::AbuseIPDB->new (%opts);

The constructor takes a hash of configuration details.

=over

=item ver

The API version - always set this as "2" to avoid potential problems
with mismatched versions.

=item key

Your key for the API as a scalar string. You must obtain one before
using this module.

=item timeout

The timeout in seconds to wait for the server to respond. Defaults to
20.

=item retry

The number of times to retry on timeout or network error. Defaults to 0
(ie. no retries).

=back

=head2 check

	my $res = $ipdb->check (ip => '127.0.0.2', max_age => 90);

This uses the C<check> endpoint and returns a
L<WebService::AbuseIPDB::CheckResponse> object to access the data held
in the database for the provided IP address. The argument is a hash with
these keys:

=over

=item ip

The IP address to be checked. This item is mandatory.

=item max_age

The age in integral days of the oldest report(s) to include. If
omitted the server default is used (currently 30).

=item verbose

If set to any true value, the data from each report itself is also returned.
B<Not yet impelemented>.

=back

=head2 report

    my $res = $ipdb->report (
        ip          => '127.0.0.2',
        categories  => [3, 4],
        comment     => 'This address is the worst'
    );

This uses the C<report> endpoint to report an abusive address. It takes a
single hash as the only argument with these elements:

=over 4

=item ip

The IP address to report. Must be a single, valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
This element is mandatory.

=item categories

An arrayref of categories as either scalar IDs or scalar names or
L<WebService::AbuseIPDB::Category> objects.
This element is mandatory.

=item comment

A scalar string with details of the offence. This is optional but
recommended in most cases. It must be no more than 1024 characters.
and should be decoded.

=back

The method will return undef on client error and a
WebService::AbuseIPDB::ReportResponse object otherwise.

=head1 STABILITY

This is currently alpha software. Be aware that both the internals and
the interface are liable to change.

=head1 TODO

Implement the C<verbose> option on the check method.

Add the other API endpoints: check-block, bulk-report, blacklist.

More validation/sanitation of inputs.

Consider using objects for errors instead of AoH.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<SendMail::AbuseIPDB> is a client for v1 of the API.

Full documentation for the API is at L<https://docs.abuseipdb.com/>.
