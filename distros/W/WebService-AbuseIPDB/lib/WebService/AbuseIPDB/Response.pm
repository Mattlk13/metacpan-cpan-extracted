=head1 NAME

WebService::AbuseIPDB::Response - Generic class for API responses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Any of the WebService::AbuseIPDB methods which send a request to the
server will return an object of this class (or its children).

    use WebService::AbuseIPDB;

    my $ipdb = WebService::AbuseIPDB->new (key => 'abc123...');
    my $res = $ipdb->check (ip => '127.0.0.2');
    unless ($res->successful) {
        for my $err (@{$res->errors}) {
            warn "Error $err->{status}: $err->{detail}\n";
        }
        die "Cannot continue.\n";
    }

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

	my $res = WebService::AbuseIPDB::Response->new ($href);

The constructor takes a hashref constructed from the JSON returned by
the API. If the argument is missing or not a reference it assumes a
catastrophic problem and sets the generic error code and message (500,
"Client could not connect");

=head2 successful

	my $ok = $res->successful;

Returns true if there were no errors, otherwise false.

=head2 errors

	my $err = $res->errors;

Returns a ref to an AoH of errors exactly as returned by the API.

=head1 STABILITY

This is currently alpha software. Be aware that both the internals and
the interface are liable to change.
