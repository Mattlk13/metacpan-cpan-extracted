Revision history for WWW-Pastebin-PastebinCom-API

1.001004   2016-12-26
        - Add META.json (ambs)

1.001003   2015-12-06
        - Re-upload to fix reset pass/fail counters, because fails
          were not due to the module, but due to pastebin.com API
          being broken for a few days. (#2)

1.001002   2015-03-13
        - Added 'owned' argument to ->paste()

1.001001   2014-10-26
        - Updated the module to reflect changes on pastebin.com
        - list_trends no longer has `format_short` and `format_long`
        - Fixed broken tests (RT#99797)
        - Updated packaging to DZIL

0.003   2013-10-29
        - Fixed a broken test

0.002   2013-10-28
        - Added the "Getting A Users Information And Settings" API
          feature that I somehow managed to miss the first time around.
        - Fixed t/kwalitee.t to run only with RELEASE_TESTING
        - Added examples/get_user_info.pl
        - Fixed a bug where the user of the module would get strange
          and confusing errors if they forgot to get a user key or
          provide an API key
        - Updated the docs to mention that
          WWW::Pastebin::PastebinCom::Retrieve provides a more
          featureful paste grab--relying on HTML parsing-- that
          pastebin's API doesn't (what would I likely want to know:
          user's settings or the expiry of the paste? The former is in
          the API the latter isn't... logic for you ~_~)

0.001   2013-10-26
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
