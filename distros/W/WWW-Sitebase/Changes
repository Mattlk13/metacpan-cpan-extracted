Revision history for WWW::Sitebase

0.15    2016-06-27
        - WWW::Sitebase::Navigator's submit_form method now uses the
          action and fields_ref arguments even if the form is provided
          via the form argument instead of read from a page.
0.14    2016-02-03
        - Added "use_defaults" option to WWW::Sitebase::Navigator to allow
          skipping the login prompts if a cached username and password
          already exists.  This allows scripts to only prompt once.
0.13    2016-01-18
        - WWW::Sitebase::Navigator now hides passwords as they're
          typed at the Password prompt.
        - WWW::Sitebase::Navigator now sets permissions on username/password
          cache file to 0600 when writing username and password (chmod
          is done after file is created/clobbered before data is written).
          The _get_acct method will also croak if the cache file cannot be
          closed.
0.12    2016-01-11
        - WWW::SiteBase::Navigator now hides password when displaying
          cached login and password information when prompting for
          username and password.
0.11    2016-01-07
        - WWW::Sitebase::Navigator's site_login method now leaves the
          current page set to the page that's reached after posting the
          login form instead of navigating to the site's home page.
          Navigating to the home page before completing
          login would in some cases return the module to a home page that is
          outside of the login area, making a login appear to fail when it had
          in fact succeeded.  If you experience difficulties logging in after
          upgrading to WWW:Sitebase v0.11, make sure your site_info's
          "login_verify_re" is testing for the page you land on after logging
          in, not the site's home page (although, if your script works,
          the home page is probably the page you land on after logging in).

        - Added Mozilla::CA prerequisite so that SSL works with
          LWP::UserAgent 6.0 defaults.
        - Changed "agent" setting in WWW::Sitebase::Navigator to report
          the browser as Safari running on MacOS 10.9.1.
        - When checking pages against regexps, WWW::Sitebase::Navigator
          now uses /ism instead of /i as the flags.  This means a regexp
          like "Sign Out.*My Accounts" will properly return true if the
          page contains "Sign Out" on one line and "My Accounts" on another.

0.09    2009-09-02
        - Improved handling of default_options to allow sub-classes
          more flexibility and backwards-compatibility when
          adding options.
        - Fixed examples in docs in Sitebase::Navigator to refer to
          using decoded_content instead of content method.
        - Fixed some Sitebase::Navigator docs that referred to Bebo.

0.08    2009-08-10
        - Fixed handling and documentation of default_options
        - Fixed bug in Sitebase::save method to make it work as
          documented

0.07    2009-08-08
        - Updated Navigor to use decoded_content instead of content method
          when checking pages for regular expressions. This solves
          problems that can occur when scanning pages with UTF-8
          encoding.

0.06    2007-08-04
        - Added use tests for Navigator and Poster in 01-load.t

0.05    2007-08-03
        - Added prerequisites to Makefile.PL
        - Updated Navigator docs to mention adding Crypt::SSLEay for
          subclasses that navigate SSL pages.

0.04    2007-08-02
        - Fixed capitalization of Sitebase module name.

0.03    2007-07-31
        - Corrected version 0.02 release date
        - Added "login_form_no" and "login_form_name" fields to site_info hash.
          This fixes an obvious bug in which logins would fail if the login form
          wasn't the second one on the page (which, oddly, it usually is...).
        - Added _submit_login method which can be overridden if needed to
          provide more control over the login form.
        - Fixed docs for submit_form.
        - Included Navigator and Poster in the distribution...

        - get_page now returns undef if it can't get the page or
          if the page doesn't match the provided RE after retrying
          20 times.
        - Added follow_to and follow_link methods.
        - _go_home method now goes to site's homepage if not
          logged in.
        - Fixed bugs in submit_form and _get_home.
        - Added debug method.
        - Cleaned Bebo-specific code from Base.pm
        - Changed "site" method name to "browser" in Sitebase.pm and
          Base.pm
        - Added Poster.pm (needs debugging).
        - Debugged Poster.pm. :)
        - Fixed max_count bug in Poster.pm (0.2).
        - Added post_count method to Poster.pm (0.3)
        - Renamed Sitebase::Base -> Sitebase.
        - Renamed Sitebase -> Sitebase::Navigator.
          - Structure now is:
            - Sitebase contains basic param validation, etc. It really
              could be used for almost any module.
            - Sitebase::Navigator is the base class for navigating
              web sites
            - Sitebase::Poster is an iterator for calling a posting method
              and remembering who was posted to.
        - Fixed documentation and package names
        - Updated Changes file with previous changes.

0.01    2006-09-30
        First version.
        Includes WWW::Sitebase and WWW::Sitebase::Base, which
        is my general base class with handy generic parsing and
        load/save methods and should probably be renamed to
        "BaseClass" or something.
