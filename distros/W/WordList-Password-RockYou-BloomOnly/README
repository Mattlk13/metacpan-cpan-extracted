NAME
    WordList::Password::RockYou::BloomOnly - RockYou password wordlist
    (~14.3mil passwords) (bloom-only edition)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of
    WordList::Password::RockYou::BloomOnly (from Perl distribution
    WordList-Password-RockYou-BloomOnly), released on 2022-08-20.

DESCRIPTION
    "word_exists()" can be used to test a string against the RockYou
    password wordlist (~14.3 million passwords). You can use it with, e.g.
    App::PasswordWordListUtils's exists-in-password-wordlist. Uses bloom
    filter (bloom size=33M, k=13, false-positve rate=0.01245%).

    The other methods like "each_word()", "all_words()", "first_word()",
    "next_word()" will return empty list of words, because this distribution
    only contains the bloom filter and not the actual wordlist.

METHODS
  word_exists

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
