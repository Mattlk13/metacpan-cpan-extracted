NAME
    WordList::Password::RockYou::BloomOnly - RockYou password wordlist
    (~14.3mil passwords) (bloom-only edition)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    WordList::Password::RockYou::BloomOnly (from Perl distribution
    WordList-Password-RockYou-BloomOnly), released on 2020-05-24.

DESCRIPTION
    "word_exists()" can be used to test a string against the RockYou
    password wordlist (~14.3 million passwords). You can use it with, e.g.
    App::PasswordWordListUtils's exists-in-password-wordlist. Uses bloom
    filter (bloom size=33M, k=13, false-positve rate=0.01245%).

    The other methods like "each_word()", "all_words()", "first_word()",
    "next_word()" will return empty list of words, because this distribution
    only contains the bloom filter and not the actual wordlist.

METHODS
  word_exists
