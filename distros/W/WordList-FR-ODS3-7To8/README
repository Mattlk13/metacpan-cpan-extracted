DESCRIPTION

    From http://www.gtoal.com/scrabble/details/french/: The official French
    scrabble wordlist is ODS. There have been three major releases of this;
    ODS2 (aka ODS '94), ODS3 (aka ODS '99) and ODS 2000. ODS 2 and ODS3 are
    available on the net if you know where to look.

    Well, I've looked but so far have only managed to find the 7- and
    8-letter ODS3 words from http://chr.amet.perso.infonie.fr/economec.htm.
    If you know a more complete list, feel free to contact me.

    Also note that words from ODS are unaccented.
