# noss
**noss** is a command-line RSS/Atom feed reader and aggregator written in

* `curl` (>= `7.68.0`)
* `lynx`
* `sqlite3` (>= `3.35.0`)

**noss** optionally depends on the following:
* `JSON::XS`: For faster JSON processing.

Once the aforementioned dependencies are installed, **noss** can be built and
installed via the following commands:
```bash
perl Makefile.PL
make

make install
```
Please consult the documentation for the `ExtUtils::MakeMaker` Perl module for
information on configuring the build process.
