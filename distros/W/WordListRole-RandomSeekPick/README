NAME
    WordListRole::RandomSeekPick - Provide a pick() implementation that
    random-seeks DATA

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of WordListRole::RandomSeekPick
    (from Perl distribution WordListRole-RandomSeekPick), released on
    2020-05-23.

DESCRIPTION
    The default WordList's "pick()" performs a scan on the whole word list
    once while collecting random items. This role provides an alternative
    implementation that random-seeks on DATA, discard the line fragment,
    then get the next line. This algorithm does not provide uniformly random
    picking, but for many cases it should be random enough. It is faster if
    you have a huge word list and just want to pick one or a few items.

    Note: since this role's "pick()" operates on the DATA filehandle
    directly instead of using "each_word()", it cannot be used on dynamic
    wordlists.

PROVIDED METHODS
  pick
