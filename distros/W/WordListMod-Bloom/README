NAME
    WordListMod::Bloom - Provide word_exists() that uses bloom filter

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of WordListMod::Bloom (from Perl
    distribution WordListMod-Bloom), released on 2020-05-01.

SYNOPSIS
    In your WordList/EN/Foo.pm:

     package WordList::EN::Foo;

     __DATA__
     word1
     word2
     ...

    In your WordListBloom/EN/Foo.pm:

     package WordListBloom::EN::Foo;
     1;
     __DATA__
     (The actual bloom filter, base64-encoded)

    Then:

     use WordList::Mod qw(get_mod_wordlist);
     my $wl = get_mod_wordlist("EN::Foo", "Bloom");

     $wl->word_exists("foo"); # uses bloom filter to check for existence.

DESCRIPTION
    EXPERIMENTAL.

    This mod provides an alternative "word_exists()" method that checks a
    bloom filter located in the data section of
    "WordListBloom::<Your_WordList_Subpackage>". This provides a low
    startup-overhead way to check an item against a big list (e.g.
    millions). Note that testing using a bloom filter can result in a false
    positive (i.e. "word_exists()" returns true but the word is not actually
    in the list.
