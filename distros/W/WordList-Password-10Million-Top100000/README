DESCRIPTION
    Source:
    <https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/10_mil
    lion_password_list_top_100000.txt> (retrieved 2018-02-20).

    Wordlist is sorted by popularity (most popular first).

    Uses random-seek pick(), which gives higher probabililty to longer
    words.

    Uses bloom filter, so word_exists() might give small probability of
    false positive (bloom filter size=260K, k=12, false-positive rate
    0.00468%).
