NAME
    CHANGES - Revision history for WordNet::Extend

DESCRIPTION
  Version 0.051 (Released 01/16/2017)
    (1) Fixed locate tests causing failure.

  Version 0.050 (Released 01/16/2017)
    (1) Added Similarity scoring method to Locate.pm

    (2) Added corresponding Sim test in WN-Locate.t

  Version 0.040 (Released 11/08/2016)
    (1) Added BwS (baseline with stemming) scoring method to Locate.pm

    (2) Added corresponding BwS test in WN-Locate.t

  Version 0.030 (Released 10/13/2016)
    (1) Fixed insertion error causing command line 'wn' to seg fault.

    (2) Fixed error preventing user from inserting multiple new lemmas at
        once.

  Version 0.020 (Released 09/29/2016)
    (1) Fixed documentation for Extend, Insert, and Locate.

    (2) Added new error check for Insert to make sure the user is not
        specifying a non existing lemma for a location.

    (3) Added new revertLastChange() function which allows the user to take
        back only the most recent insert.

  Version 0.014 (Released 09/19/2016)
    (1) Added pod for README and Changes.

    (2) Fixed synopsis example to allow user to copy and paste right out of
        the box.

    (3) Separated the insert functionality from the locate functionality.
        Insert exists in Insert.pm and locate in Locate.pm. This results in
        WordNet::Insert becoming WordNet::Extend.

    (4) Added attach() and merge() function into Insert.pm which inserts
        lemma into specified location in WordNet. The old insert() function,
        which locates where they should be inserted, has been changed to
        locate(). insertFile() has also been changed to locateFile().

    (5) Added test case for inserting item into WordNet.

  Version 0.02 (Released 05/26/2016)
    (1) Fixed test file to properly use Test::More.
