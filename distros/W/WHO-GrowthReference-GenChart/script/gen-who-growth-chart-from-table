 % gen-who-growth-chart-from-table [--debug] [--format=name] [--json]
     [--log-level=level] [--(no)naked-res] [--name=s]

     [--view-result[=program]] [--which=s] <gender> <dob> <table>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--dob>=I<s>*

=item B<--gender>=I<s>*

Valid values:

 ["M","F"]

=item B<--name>=I<s>

=item B<--table>=I<s>*

Table of growth, must be in CSV/TSV format, containing at least age/date and weight/height columns.

TSV/CSV must have header line.

Date must be string in YYYY-MM-DD format. Age must be float in years. Weight
must be float in kg. Height must be float in cm.

Example:

    date,height,weight
    2020-11-01,113.5,17.8
    2020-11-15,113.5,17.9
    2020-12-01,114,17.9
    2020-12-15,114,17.9
    2021-01-01,115,18.1
    2021-01-15,115.5,18.3
    2021-02-01,116,18.4


=item B<--which>=I<s>*

Specify which chart to generate.

Valid values:

 ["height","weight","bmi"]

=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C gen-who-growth-chart-from-table gen-who-growth-chart-from-table

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete gen-who-growth-chart-from-table 'p/*/`gen-who-growth-chart-from-table`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.
