SYNOPSIS
     use WHO::GrowthReference::Table qw(get_who_growth_reference);

     # get mean height & weight of a 3-year old girl

     my $res = get_who_growth_reference(gender => "F", dob => time() - 3*365.25*86400);
     # => [200, "OK", {
     #      age => "36.0 month(s)",
     #      mean_height => 95.034, # cm
     #      mean_weight => 13.9,   # kg
     #     }]

     # you have a 3.5-year old boy weighing at 14.8kg and with a height of 102cm,
     # calculate the percentiles

     my $res = get_who_growth_reference(gender => "M", dob => time() - 3.5*365.25*86400, weight=>14.8, height=>102);
     # => [200, "OK", {
     #      age => "42.0 month(s)",
     #      mean_height => 99.844, # cm
     #      height_percentile => 70.2, # your boy's height is above world average, about 70.2% of boys of the same age are shorter than your boy
     #      mean_weight => 15.3,   # kg
     #      weight_percentile => 39.6, # your boy's weight is below world average, about 39.6% of boys of the same age weigh less than your boy
     #     }]
