SYNOPSIS
     use WHO::GrowthReference::Table qw(get_who_growth_reference);

     # get mean height & weight of a 3-year old girl

     my $res = get_who_growth_reference(gender => "F", dob => time() - 3*365.25*86400);
     # => [200, "OK", {
     #      age => "36.0 month(s)",
     #      height_mean => 95.034, # cm
     #      weight_mean => 13.9,   # kg
     #      height_P01  => ..., # height at 0.1% percentile
     #      height_P1   => ..., # height at 1% percentile
     #      height_Z-3  => ..., # height at -3 SD
     #      height_Z-2  => ..., # height at -2 SD
     #      ...
     #     }]

     # you have a 3.5-year old boy weighing at 14.8kg and with a height of 102cm,
     # calculate the percentiles

     my $res = get_who_growth_reference(gender => "M", dob => time() - 3.5*365.25*86400, weight=>14.8, height=>102);
     # => [200, "OK", {
     #      age => "42.0 month(s)",
     #      height_mean => 99.844, # cm
     #      height_percentile => 70.2, # your boy's height is above world average, about 70.2% of boys of the same age are shorter than your boy
     #      height_zscore => ...,
     #      weight_mean => 15.3,   # kg
     #      weight_percentile => 39.6, # your boy's weight is below world average, about 39.6% of boys of the same age weigh less than your boy
     #      weight_zscore => ...,
     #      height_P01 => ...,
     #      ...

FUNCTIONS
  get_who_growth_reference
    Usage:

     get_who_growth_reference(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Lookup height/weight in the WHO growth chart (a.k.a. growth reference,
    growth standards).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   age => *duration*

    *   dob => *date*

    *   gender* => *str*

    *   height => *float*

        Specify height to calculate percentile.

    *   now => *date*

        Assume now is this date, instead of current date.

    *   weight => *float*

        Specify weight to calculate percentile.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
