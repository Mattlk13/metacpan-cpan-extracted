    Caveats:

    Currently the z-zcore line values (e.g. height_Z1, height_Z-1, etc) are
    calculated using linear interpolation.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   age => *duration*

        (No description)

    *   dob => *date*

        (No description)

    *   gender* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   height => *float*

        Specify height to calculate percentile.

    *   now => *date*

        Assume now is this date, instead of current date.

    *   weight => *float*

        Specify weight to calculate percentile.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

    that CDC also publishes growth standards; I might write

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
