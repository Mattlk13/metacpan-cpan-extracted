NAME
    WordList::Special::Stdin - Wordlist from STDIN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of WordList::Special::Stdin (from
    Perl distribution WordList-Special-Stdin), released on 2022-07-23.

SYNOPSIS
    From Perl:

     use WordList::Special::Stdin;

     my $wl = WordList::Special::Stdin->new();
     $wl->each_word(sub { ... });

    From the command-line:

     % some-prog-that-produces-words | wordlist -w Special::Stdin

    Typical use-case is to filter some words, either some wordlist or other
    programs:

     % wordlist ... | wordlist -w Special::Stdin --len 5 '/foo/'

DESCRIPTION
    This is a special wordlist to get list of words from standard input.

WORDLIST PARAMETERS
    This is a parameterized wordlist module. When loading in Perl, you can
    specify the parameters to the constructor, for example:

     use WordList::Special::Stdin;
     my $wl = WordList::Special::Stdin->(bar => 2, foo => 1);

    When loading on the command-line, you can specify parameters using the
    "WORDLISTNAME=ARGNAME1,ARGVAL1,ARGNAME2,ARGVAL2" syntax, like in perl's
    "-M" option, for example:

     % wordlist -w Special::Stdin=foo,1,bar,2 ...

    Known parameters:

  cache
    Whether to cache the words the first time until EOF, then reuse them
    later.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
