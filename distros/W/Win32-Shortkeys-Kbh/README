DESCRIPTION

    This module uses Win32 API fucntions to create a keyboard hook with
    register_hook. A sub ref is pass to the hook with set_key_processor.
    This sub is called on key press and key release. It receives the key
    code and can react using seng_string or send_cmd.

    If you run the code (also in example/example.pl) in the synopsis and if
    you open the notepad any keys except the s will be print out normaly.
    When the s key is relead the keyboard will print 'You hit the s key'.
    F12 will terminate the script.

 set_key_processor( $my_sub_ref )

    The sub passed to this function received the following parameters

    $cup

      Indicates if the key is released ($cup > 0) or pressed ($cup == 0)

    $code

      The virtual key code of the key

    $alt

      Indicates if the alt key is pressed ($alt > 0) or not ($alt == 0)

    $ext

      Indicates ($ext == 1) if extended-key flag is set or not ($ext == 0).
      Following ms windows documentation this flag is set if one of the
      additional keys on the enhanced keyboard is used. The extended keys
      consist of the ALT and CTRL keys on the right-hand side of the
      keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys
      in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; the NUM LOCK key;
      the BREAK (CTRL+PAUSE) key; the PRINT SCRN key; and the divide (/)
      and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad.

 register_hook

 unregister_hook

 msg_loop

    calls this to prevent your script from leaving and use next function to
    quit.

 send_cmd($how_much, $vk_code)

    VK_CODE are exported by this module and can be use as constant in the
    perl code.

 send_string("bla")

     C<register_hook>. Send string (C<send_string("bla")>or commands C<send_cmd(how_much, VK_TAB)> to the keyboard:
