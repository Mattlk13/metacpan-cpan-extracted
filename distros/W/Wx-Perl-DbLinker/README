DESCRIPTION

    This module automates the process of tying data from a database to
    widgets on a xrc-generated form.

    Steps for use:

      * Create a Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker::xxxDataManager object that contains
      the rows to display. Use DbiDataManager, RdbDataManager or
      DbcDataManager depending on how you access the database: sql commands
      and DBI, DBIx::Class or Rose::DB::Object

      * Create xrc resource files to construct the gui: Wx windows and
      controls. It is required that you name your widgets the same as the
      fields in your data source.

      * Create a Wx::Perl:DbLinker::Wxform object that links the data and
      the gui

      * Connect the buttons to methods that handle common actions such as
      inserting, moving, deleting, etc.
