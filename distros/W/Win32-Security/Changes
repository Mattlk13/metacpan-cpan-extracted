Revision history for Perl extension Win32::Security

?.??  FUTURE Development Goals
  - Add support for Unicode characters in Win32::Security::NamedObject
    and Win32::Security::Recursor, and trustees (usernames/groups).
  - Improve test suite coverage for DENY vs ALLOW ACEs
  - Expand test suite to explicitly cover:
    - Win32::Security::ACL
    - Win32::Security::NamedObject
    - Win32::Security::SID
  - Significantly expanded testing for PermChg.pl
  - PermChg.pl -f is not really trustworthy or fully defined

0.60  Fri Sep 20 2024
  - First release in 20.5 years!
  - Fixes to test scripts to support updates in Windows since 2004!
  - Added support for Strawberry Perl 5.40 x64 Perl while retaining
    x86 support at least as far back as ActivePerl 5.16!
  - Fixed inheritance validation bug related to DENY and ALLOW ACEs being
    treated as identical ACEs for permission occlusion.
  - Significant changes/bug fixes to AdjustTokenPrivileges and use thereof.
  - Attempt privilege escalation to enable reading/manipulating security
    information when elevated privileges are available
  - Bug fix for setting ownerTrustee/SID on recent versions of Windows.
  - Bug fix for remote registry access (thanks nobull67@gmail.com)
  - Added support for -file option to PermDump.pl.
  - Extensive changes to NamedObject and Recursor to improve performance,
    especially when dumping both owner and dacl information.
  - Significant performance improvements were made to Data::BitMask, which
    are available in Data::BitMask 1.00.  PermDump.pl saw a ~20% speed up.
  - Adding support for x64 (while retaining x86 support) required extensive
    changes in Raw.pm, along with some in NamedObject.pm.
  - Added test suite for Win32::Security::Raw.
  - Fixes in t/scripts.t to support newer versions of cacls.exe that return
    "(ID)" (Inherited from Directory) for inherited permissions.
  - Added version numbers to all module files (and updated copyright dates)
  - Enabled extended tests (computers got faster over the past 20 years).

0.50  Sat Mar 20 2004
  - Moved to using Build.PL (i.e. Module::Build).
  - Moved utility scripts into script dir so they will install to Perl/bin
  - Used subclassing in Build.PL to avoid turning them into BAT files
  - Added package lines to (ACE|ACL|NamedObject|Recursor).pm to get them to
    show up in META.yml
  - Changed .t files to PC line endings
  - Added support to ACTION_distdir in Build.PL to turn off extended tests
  - Overrode make_tarball in Build.PL to avoid Archive::Tar (which is broken)
    and use tar and gzip from the command line.  I will remove this when
    a default install of Archive::Tar and Module::Build under ActivePerl
    does not result in a flat tar file!
  - Fixes to error_.* calls in W::S::Recursor::SE_FILE_OBJECT::PermDump
  - Added PPM support to Build.PL
  - Removed dacl_noprop from PermChg.pl because of an obscure bug involving
    inheritance blocking preventing a subsequent dacl update from rippling
    the updates.
  - Added test for and fixed bug involving standalone -b passed to PermChg.pl

0.28  Sat Mar 13 2004
  - Fixed owner code in Win32::Security::Recursor::SE_FILE_OBJECT::PermDump
  - Looked over PermFix.pl and tidied up some typos in the docs
  - Added CI, OI, IO, etc. flag aliases to Win32::Security::ACE
  - Got PermChg.pl working (albeit without owner support)
  - Developed the first real test suites - extended.t and scripts.t
  - Tore up and rewrote huge chunks of the inheritance checking code as a
    result of the above.  The black box that implements permission
    inheritance is a wiley adversary to understand.
  - Decided to release with PermFix.pl and PermChg.pl in beta.

0.27  Mon Jan 19 2004
  - Flattened Recursor into a queue based loop - no more proper recursion
  - Updated PermDump.pl to function.
  - Decided to release without PermChg.pl and PermFix.pl, which are both
    still under development and in testing.
  - Moved Win32 into lib directory and updated MANIFEST and Makefile.PL

0.26  ??? Dec ?? 2003
  - Delayed due to flood in downstairs of house.  Highly recommend that
    people check and replace their washing machine hoses on a regular
    basis.  Stainless steel braid jacketed ones are worth it.
  - Another Recursor refactoring

0.25  ??? Nov ?? 2003
  - I really need to spend the time on this and release it
  - aclRevision is now largely gone (replaced by routines that DWIW)
  - Recursor refactoring

0.24  ??? Oct ?? 2003
  - Implementation of mutable objects via proper
    flyweight pattern
  - Addition of SE_REGISTRY_KEY support
  - Clean-up of mutability support

0.23  ??? Sep 20 2003
  - Fifth almost:) CPANed release
  - Implementation of multiple-inheritance via C::P

0.22  ??? Sep 10 2003
  - Fourth almost:) CPANed release
  - Recursor.pm becomes a reality

0.21  Wed Sep 3 2003
  - Third almost:) CPANed release
  - ACEs are now subclassed on AceType and fake subclassed on objectType
  - DACL.pm becomes ACL.pm

0.20  Sat Aug 30 2003
  - second almost:) CPANed release
  - ACEs are now first-class objects
  - Lots of bug fixes resulting from that

0.10  Tue Aug 26 2003
  - first almost:) CPANed release
