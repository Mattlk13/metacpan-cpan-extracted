NAME
    WordLists::EN::CommonException - Collection of English common exception
    words

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of WordLists::EN::CommonException
    (from Perl distribution WordLists-EN-CommonException), released on
    2020-07-01.

DESCRIPTION
    Common exception words, sometimes called "red words", or "tricky words",
    or "sight words", are words that don't quite follow the spelling or
    phonics rules but are often found in high frequency in English text [1].
    Examples would include "once", "our", "was", etc. Therefore, children
    are taught to memorize these words in early years of learning.

    Each school or teacher will probably setup a slightly different list of
    these words.

    From monsterphonics.com: "The most top 300 high-frequency words make up
    65% of all printed words. Almost half of these are not decodable using
    phonics. The result is that around a quarter of the words that children
    are asked to learn to read and spell cannot be done so phonetically. It
    is therefore vital to explicitly teach the common exception words."
