0.01    12-08-2023/00:21
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

	Removed the 'INSTALL_BASE' from Makefile.PL
	Added Log::Log4perl as a dependency for the testing phase.
	Minor POD changes.

0.04	23-08-2023/14:30
	Fixed the error message when checking for correct parameters, replaced 'description' with 'name'.
	Added feature: user can specify javascript code to create the information hash
	to be returned for each matched element. Before the return was a hash of "tag" and "id".
	Now the user can optionally specify the javascript code to create this information hash.
	The fallback behaves as in previous version, there should be no breaks.
	POD extended.
	Two more module dependencies added (required for testing).
