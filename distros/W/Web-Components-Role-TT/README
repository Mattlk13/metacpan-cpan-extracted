Name

    Web::Components::Role::TT - Applies Template as a Moo::Role

Synopsis

       use Moo;
    
       with 'Web::Components::Role::TT';
    
       $rendered_template = $self->render_template( $stash );

Description

    Uses Template to render templates, typically producing a page of HTML.
    It is meant to be used in conjunction with Web::Components and
    Web::ComposableRequest as it's API assumes these are used

    Templates are assumed to be encoded as utf8

Configuration and Environment

    Defines the following attributes;

    templates

      A lazily evaluated directory which defaults to templates in the
      configuration var directory. This is where the templates are stored

      The path to the template file is templates/<skin>/<layout>.tt. The
      skin and layout attributes default to the values of the configuration
      object

    Requires the following attributes to be provided by the consuming
    class;

    config

      Requires the configuration attribute to provide the following
      attributes;

      layout

	The default template name if none is provided in the stash

      skin

	The default skin if none is provided in the stash

      tempdir

	Path to the directory where Template will store the compiled
	templates

      vardir

	Path to the directory where the templates are stored

Subroutines/Methods

 render_template

       $rendered_template = $self->render_template( $stash );

    The $stash hash reference may contain a config attribute, otherwise the
    invocant is expected to provide a config object

    The $stash should contain either a template attribute or skin and page
    attributes. If a template attribute is provided it should be a hash
    reference containing skin and layout attributes. If the page attribute
    is provided it should be a hash reference that contains a layout
    attribute

    The layout attribute is either a path to the template or a scalar
    reference that contains the template

Diagnostics

    The compiled templates are stored in subdirectories below the
    configuration temporary directory
