NAME
    WordListRole::Bloom - Provide word_exists() that uses bloom filter

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of WordListRole::Bloom (from Perl
    distribution WordListRole-Bloom), released on 2022-08-20.

SYNOPSIS
    In your lib/WordList/EN/Foo.pm:

     package WordList::EN::Foo;

     use parent 'WordList';

     use Role::Tiny::With;
     with 'WordListRole::Bloom';

     __DATA__
     word1
     word2
     ...

    In your share/bloom, create your bloom filter data file, e.g. with
    bloomgen:

     % perl -ne 'print if (/^__DATA__$/ .. 0) && $i++' lib/WordList/EN/Foo.pm | \
       bloomgen -n 1234 -p 0.1% > share/bloom

    (where "-n" is set to the number of words, "-p" to the maximum
    false-positive rate).

    After that, in yourscript.pl:

     my $wl = WordList::EN::Foo->new;
     $wl->word_exists("foo"); # uses bloom filter to check for existence.

DESCRIPTION
    This role provides an alternative "word_exists()" method that checks a
    bloom filter located in the distribution share directory (share/bloom).
    This provides a low startup-overhead way to check an item against a big
    list (e.g. millions). Note that testing using a bloom filter can result
    in a false positive (i.e. "word_exists()" returns true but the word is
    not actually in the list.

PROVIDED METHODS
  word_exists

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
