Win32-HTA version 1.02
======================

HTML Applications are an easy way to build simple and not so simple
GUI applications using HTML with script languages supported by Internet
Explorer (Javascript, VBScript and even PerlScript if you are using
ActivePerl).

As I am using Strawberry Perl, I thought launching mshta.exe from inside perl
and then communicating via AJAX could be interesting.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The module only uses the standard modules
   - Carp
   - File::Temp
   - Storable
   - Win32

With this you will be able to pass a single string back to the perl
script. For Ajax functions you will need:

   - Win32::Process
   - JSON

And you should run on Windows and have mshta.exe, of course.
