NAME

    Wasm::Hook - Automatically load WebAssembly modules without a Perl
    wrapper

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Wasm::Hook;
     use Foo::Bar;  # will load Foo/Bar.wasm or Foo/Bar.wat if no Foo/Bar.pm is found
     no Wasm::Hook; # turns off automatic wasm / wat loading

DESCRIPTION

    This module installs an @INC hook that automatically loads WebAssembly
    (Wasm) files so that they can be used like a Perl module, without:

    The functions inside the WebAssembly module are exportable via the
    Exporter module. @EXPORT_OK is used, so you will need to explicitly
    export functions.

      * Having to write a boilerplate .pm file that loads the WebAssembly

      * The caller needing to even know or care that the module is
      implemented in something other than Perl.

    This module will only load a WebAssembly module if there is now Perl
    Module (.pm file) with the appropriate name.
