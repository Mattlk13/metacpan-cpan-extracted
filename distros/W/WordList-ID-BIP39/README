NAME
    WordList::ID::BIP39 - Indonesian (proposed) word list for BIP 39

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of WordList::ID::BIP39 (from Perl
    distribution WordList-ID-BIP39), released on 2018-01-01.

SYNOPSIS
     use WordList::ID::BIP39;

     my $wl = WordList::ID::BIP39->new;

     # Pick a (or several) random word(s) from the list
     my $word = $wl->pick;
     my @words = $wl->pick(3);

     # Check if a word exists in the list
     if ($wl->word_exists('foo')) { ... }

     # Call a callback for each word
     $wl->each_word(sub { my $word = shift; ... });

     # Get all the words
     my @all_words = $wl->all_words;

DESCRIPTION
    This is the proposed Indonesian word list for BIP 39. The list was
    formed by selecting the most common Indonesian words from Wikipedia (see
    WordLists::ID::Common repository) that are at least 4 characters long
    and are not found in the other BIP 39 wordlists (EN, ES, FR, FR).
    Characteristics of this wordlist:

    *   Selected from most common words (Wikipedia Indonesia corpus).

    *   At least 4 characters long.

    *   Words can be uniquely determined typing the first 4 characters.

    *   Words are not found in the other languages' BIP wordlist, so
        language detection is easy.
