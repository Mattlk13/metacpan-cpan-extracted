    Graphics::ColorNames::* module.

WORDLIST PARAMETERS

    When loading on the command-line, you can specify parameters using the
    "WORDLISTNAME=ARGNAME1,ARGVAL1,ARGNAME2,ARGVAL2" syntax, like in perl's
    "-M" option, for example:

     % wordlist -w ColorName::Any=foo,1,bar,2 ...

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
