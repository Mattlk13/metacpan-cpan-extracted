NAME

    WebService::KVV::Live::Stop - Arrival times for Trams/Buses in the
    Karlsruhe metropolitan area

SYNOPSIS

        use WebService::KVV::Live::Stop;
    
        my $stop = WebService::KVV::Live::Stop->new("Siemensallee");
        print "Arrival time: $_->{time} $_->{route} $_->{destination}\n" for $stop->departures;

DESCRIPTION

    API for searching for bus/tram stops in the Karlsruhe Metropolitan Area
    (Karlsruhe Verkehrsvertriebe network to be exact) and for listing
    departure times at said stops.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Not really an API, just a client for http://live.kvv.de. See
    kvvlive.json
    <https://github.com/athreef/WebService-KVV-Live-Stop/blob/master/share/kvvlive.json>
    for details.

    The client is based on Net::HTTP::Spore and has some workarounds: It
    overrides a method from Net::HTTP::Spore  that doesn't handle colons
    properly and throws a generic message on errors instead of the more
    specific HTTP error messages.

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

    new($latitude, $langitude), new($name), new($id)

      Search for matching local transport stops. $id are identifiers
      starting with "de:". $name need not be an exact match.

      Returns a list of WebService::KVV::Live::Stops in list context. In
      scalar context returns the best match.

    departures([$route])

      Returns a list of departures for a WebService::KVV::Live::Stop.
      Results can be restricted to a particular route (Linie) by the
      optional argument.
