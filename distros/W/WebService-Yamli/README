NAME

    WebService::Yamli - Perl wrapper for Yamli's Arabic transliteration
    service

SYNOPSIS

        use WebService::Yamli;
    
        # non-OO:
        my $tr = WebService::Yamli::tr('perl di 7aga la6eefa aslan');
        say $tr; # the whole sentence transliterated
    
        my @tr = WebService::Yamli::tr('perl');
        say "@tr"; # a list of candidates

DESCRIPTION

    Franco-Arabic, aka Chat Arabic, Arabizy, is a transliteration of
    Arabic, commonly used on the internet. It restricts itself to the ASCII
    charset and substitutes numbers for the Arabic characters which have no
    equivalent in Latin.

    This Module is an interface to Yamli.com's API.

IMPLEMENTATION

    It seems there's no way to feed the Yamli API more than one word, so
    currently each word results in a HTTP request. Define
    $WebService::Yamli::HTTPS if HTTPS should be used instead.

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

    tr($arg)

      Transliterates argument. Returns transliterated string, except if
      input is a single word and subroutine is in list context, in that
      case it returns a candidate list
