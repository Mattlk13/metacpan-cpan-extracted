NAME
    WordList::ID::KBBI::ByClass::Adverb - Indonesian adverb words from Kamus
    Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI), 3e

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    WordList::ID::KBBI::ByClass::Adverb (from Perl distribution
    WordList-ID-KBBI-ByClass-Adverb), released on 2024-11-19.

SYNOPSIS
     use WordList::ID::KBBI::ByClass::Adverb;

     my $wl = WordList::ID::KBBI::ByClass::Adverb->new;

     # Pick a (or several) random word(s) from the list
     my ($word) = $wl->pick;
     my ($word) = $wl->pick(1);  # ditto
     my @words  = $wl->pick(3);  # no duplicates

     # Check if a word exists in the list
     if ($wl->word_exists('foo')) { ... }  # case-sensitive

     # Call a callback for each word
     $wl->each_word(sub { my $word = shift; ... });

     # Iterate
     my $first_word = $wl->first_word;
     while (defined(my $word = $wl->next_word)) { ... }

     # Get all the words (beware, some wordlists are *huge*)
     my @all_words = $wl->all_words;

DESCRIPTION
    This wordlist uses random-seek picking, which gives higher probability
    for longer words. See File::RandomLine for more details.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
