NAME

    Wishlist - A multi-user web application for tracking wanted items.

SYNOPSIS

      $ wishlist daemon
      $ wishlist prefork
      $ hypnotoad `which wishlist`

DESCRIPTION

    Wishlist is a Mojolicious application for storing and sharing wishlists
    derived from external urls. Users paste urls and the app fetches data
    from those sites. Users can then add the item to their wishlist. Other
    users can then mark the item as purchased.

    The application is very raw, lots of feature improvement is possible.
    It was developed as examples from several of the posts
    <https://mojolicious.io/blog/tag/wishlist/> during the 2017 Mojolicious
    Advent Calendar <https://mojolicious.io/blog/tag/advent/>. I hope that
    it will continue to improve, with community collaboration, into a fully
    fledge competitor to cloud solutions that track and mine your data.

DEPLOYING

    As Wishlist is just a Mojolicious application, all of the "DEPLOYMENT"
    in Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook options are available for deployment.

 APPLICATION HOME

    The application home is where Wishlist stores data and looks for
    configuration. It can be set by setting WISHLIST_HOME in your
    environment, otherwise your current working directory is used.

 CONFIGURATION

      {
        site_name => 'Family Wishlist',
        secrets => ['a very secret string'],
        database => '/path/to/database/file.db',
      }

    A configuration file is highly recommended. Its contents should
    evaluate to a Perl data structure. The easiest usage is to create a
    configuration file in the "APPLICATION HOME". The file should be called
    wishlist.conf or wishlist.$mode.conf if per-mode configuration is
    desired. Alternatively, an absolute path to the configuration file can
    be given via WISHLIST_CONFIG.

    The allowed configuration options are

    site_name

      A string specifying the name of the site. Used in the link to the
      application root. Defaults to Mojo Wishlist.

    secrets

      An array reference of strings used to sign storage cookies. While
      this value is optional, it is highly recommended. Learn about how
      these work at
      https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/16/day-16-the-secret-life-of-sessions.

    database

      Path to the file used to store data via Mojo::SQLite. If not
      specified the default value will be wishlist.db. Any relative values
      will be relative to the "APPLICATION HOME".

    hypnotoad

      Hypnotoad uses the application's configuration for deployment
      parameters. If you deploy using it, you probably should read
      "Hypnotoad" in Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook.
