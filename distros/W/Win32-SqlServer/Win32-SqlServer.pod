Win32::SqlServer - Access SQL Server from Perl via OLE DB

There is no POD documentation for this module. Please refer to
Win32-SqlServer.html, which is in site\html\lib\Win32\SqlServer.html or
under its own name in the source directory for Win32::SqlServer.

If you sse this on CPAN, please refer to
http://www.sommarskog.se/mssql/Win32-SqlServer.html. My apologies for
the inconvenience, but the manual is simply too long to fight with it
in POD.
