NAME

    Win32::Vcpkg - Interface to Microsoft Vcpkg

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     use Win32::Vcpkg;
     my $root = Win32::Vcpkg->root;
     my $triplet = Win32::Vcpkg->perl_triplet;

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an interface for finding and using Vcpkg packages.
    Vcpkg is a Visual C++ library package manager, and as such is useful in
    building XS and FFI extensions for Visual C++ builds of Perl.

METHODS

 root

     my $path = Win32::Vcpkg->root;

    Returns a Path::Tiny object for the root of the Vcpkg install.

 perl_triplet

     my $triplet = Win32::Vcpkg->perl_triplet;

    Returns the triplet needed for linking against Perl.

 default_triplet

     my $triplet = Win32::Vcpkg->default_triplet;

    Returns the default triplet for the current environment.

ENVIRONMENT

    VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET

      This is Vcpkg's default triplet. If set this will override platform
      detection for the default triplet.

    PERL_WIN32_VCPKG_ROOT

      If set, this will be used for the Vcpkg root instead of automatic
      detection logic.

    PERL_WIN32_VCPKG_DEBUG

      If set to true, will link against debug libraries.
