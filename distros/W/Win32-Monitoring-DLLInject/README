Win32-Monitoring-DLLInject 
==========================

INSTALLATION

    Unpack the distribution into a local directory, and from a command
    prompt in that directory follow the instructions below.

    These instructions assume that you have already set up your build
    environment, and that you can build source distributions. The 
    following environments are known to work:

  Microsoft Visual Studio 2008

    Other versions of Visual Studio may work, adjust Makefile.PL 
    as necessary for your build environment

      perl Makefile.PL
      nmake
      nmake test
      nmake install

INJECTOR DLL 

    Our DLLInject.dll has known to compile with mingw32 (IMCROSS 2008-06-04)
    on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS compiled in the following way: 

       cd HookedFunctions
       make -f Makefile.migw32.mak

    Compiling with Visual Studio 2008 should work too after redefining some
    preprocessor instructions. This is still pending in the current
    HookedFunctions.c code.
