    Perl distribution WordList-FromFile-Word), released on 2022-07-23.

SYNOPSIS
    From Perl:

     use WordList::FromFile::Word;

     my $wl = WordList::FromFile::Word->new(
         filename => '/path/to/file.txt', # required
         #unique => 1, # optional, default is false

    From the command-line:

DESCRIPTION
    This is a dynamic wordlist to get list of words from words in file.
    Words are extracted using the simple regular expression:

     /(\w+)/

WORDLIST PARAMETERS

    When loading on the command-line, you can specify parameters using the
    "WORDLISTNAME=ARGNAME1,ARGVAL1,ARGNAME2,ARGVAL2" syntax, like in perl's
    "-M" option, for example:

     % wordlist -w FromFile::Word=foo,1,bar,2 ...

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional
    steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to
    me.
